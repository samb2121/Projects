In this project, we explored common network protocols, analyzed network traces, and performed local network attacks from both offensive and defensive perspectives.

Objectives:
- Understand core network protocols and concepts.
- Learn offensive techniques to attack local network traffic.
- Apply traffic analysis to detect security issues.

Part 1: Network Attacks
- Goal: Perform man-in-the-middle attacks to alter HTTP content.
- Setup: Use VirtualBox and provided VM.
- Task: Modify ./attack.py to replace AES keys from freeaeskey.xyz with a known key.
- Grad students: Perform similar attack over HTTPS using attack_https.py.

Part 2: Anomaly Detection
- Goal: Detect port scanning in network traffic.
- Task: Develop detector.py to analyze PCAP files for SYN scans.
- Technique: Identify IPs sending excessive SYN packets compared to SYN+ACK responses.

Submission:
- attack.py: Script for HTTP attack.
- attack_https.py: Script for HTTPS attack (grad only).
- detector.py: Program for SYN scan detection.
