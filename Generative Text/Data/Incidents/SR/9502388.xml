         <NarrativeText>This interviews were captured on my body worn camera.  On 10/18/2023 at approximately 2207 hours, I was instructed by the McHenry Barrack to respond to 300 Cassel Ridge Drive, Apt 15 Grantsville, MD 21536, for a report of a sexual assault. Upon my arrival, I made contact with the complainant, Jennifer Grimes. Grimes advised that her daughter, Aliviah Brunner, was sexually assaulted by a 16-year juvenile, Anthony David Glahn, who resides at apartment 17. I asked Grimes if I could speak with Aliviah Brunner who was upstairs in her apartment with two other friends. Brunner appeared calm upon first contact. I asked Brunner what happened on 10/8/2023. Brunner advised she and four other friends where at a friends apartment located at 203 Main St, Grantsville, MD 21536. Brunner advised the apartment was her friend Lyndsay Robrants. She stated she was with Anthony Glahn, Joshua Miller, Climintine Boyer, Lyndsay Robrant, and herself. Brunner advised they were playing a game called spin the bottle. Brunner advised they were all drinking beer and wine that was located in the refrigerator of the apartment. Brunner stated she drank 2-3 regular drinks of wine out of the bottle. She advised they all played spin the bottle for approximately 15 minutes. Brunner advised she then took one sip of Busch light beer while playing spin the bottle. She advised after the game was over, Boyer, Robrant, and Miller went into Robrants bedroom. She stated that Glahn went into the other bedroom by himself. Brunner stated Glahn came out of the bedroom and asked her if she wanted to come lay in bed with him. Brunner stated she went and laid beside him in bed. She stated she was lying next to him playing on her phone when Glahn asked her if she wanted to make out. Brunner stated she replied I guess. She stated while making out with Glahn, Glahn was getting touchy. I asked Brunner what she ment by touchy. Brunner advised they were kissing each other on their sides facing each other. She stated that Glahn was touching her thighs and her stomach. She stated Glahn was telling her that she was beautiful and that he wanted to be with her. Brunner advised they made out for approximately 5 minutes. Brunner advised she does not remember the incident from that point, but advised that she remembers that her shorts where pulled down around her ankles and that her underwear was around her thighs. She advised she does not remember how her underwear ended up around her thighs. She advised she remembers Glahn on top of her with his shorts around his thighs. Brunner stated she remembers Glahns penis was inside her vagina. Brunner stated she does not remember saying that she wanted to have sex with Glahn. She advised Brunner stated Glahns penis went into her vagina 3-4 times before she remembers she told him to stop to get off of her. She advised that Glahn got off of her, but asked what was wrong and still tried to touch her. Brunner stated she told Glahn that she did not want to be near him. She advised she does not remember leaving the bedroom, but woke up on the couch. Brunner advised she woke up that morning wearing her shorts and underwear but does not remember putting them on. I advised Brunner if she could locate the clothing that she wore the night of the incident. Brunner advised she was wearing black underwear that night, and that they were somewhere in pile of dirty clothes in her closet. She advised she would not be able to locate them that night. Brunner advised that shorts she was wearing belonged to Lyndsey Robrant. Cpl. Wagoner then explained to Grimes and Brunner that Brunner needed to seek medical treatment for an evaluation.   Grimes advised she would provide M/T. Brick with the two other juveniles that was in the apartment the night of the incident.    Clinitine Boyer   35 Zhenner Road   Grantsville, MD 21536   301.746.2282    Myself, Cpl. Wagoner and M/T Brenneman respond to300 Cassel Ridge Drive, Apt 17 Grantsville, MD 21536 to make contact with Anthony Glahn. We made contact with Ashly Glahn who is the mother of Anthony Glahn. Ashly advised she was made aware of the incident. I read Anthony his Miranda Rights from my Miranda rights card at approximately 2331 hours. Ashly advised she was like to contact an attorney tomorrow morning 10/19/2023 prior to Anthony answering any questions.    I request this case be forwarded to C.E.D. for further investigation. The victim/complaint was made aware of the case number.     </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 10/19/2023 at approximately 1100 hours, I responded to 300 Cassel Ridge Apt #15. I made contact with Jennifer Crites, mother of victim. I strongly suggested that she take her daughter in an attempt to get a SAFE Kit completed. I asked the mother about clothing that the daughter had on, as initial responding troopers asked her to gather them up. Crites admitted that she did not do that yet and would ask her daughter when she gets home from school about the clothes she was wearing on the night of the incident. Mother will be bringing the daughter to the barrack for a follow-up interview on 10/24/2023.  On 10/19/2023 I also made contact with the SRO at Northern Middle School J Wilt, GCSO. She will be providing me with details as to conversations she had with the victim Bruner and Suspect Glahn, leading up to the actual report of Rape It should be noted that SRO Wilt did not initiate the conversations and received no actual complaint or admittance of guilt from either party regarding the complaint.  On 10/23/2023I was contacted by CPL Davis, Duty Officer McHenry Barrack. Davis informed me that Jennifer Grimes had called in at 0700 hours and stated that her and her daughter will not be coming to the barrack on 10/24/2023 for an interview. Grimes informed Davis that her daughter had recanted her initial complaint and does not want to pursue the initial complaint.  On 10/24/2023, I went to Cassel Ridge Apt. #15 in an attempt to contact Grimes for a face to face interview. Grimes was not home, but I was informed by a family member that she was at work. I then responded to the Dollar Store, Accident Maryland and made contact with Grimes. Grimes confirmed that her daughter recanted her initial statement and is not pursuing any additional investigation. Grimes advised that her daughter will not be providing statement and wants no further investigation.  I contacted GCSO SRO Wilt and asked her if she has had any contact with either party involved. She stated that she has had brief contact with Brunner and everything seemed back to normal in her social circle.  Case closed due to an uncooperative victim. </NarrativeText>
