         <NarrativeText>On 8/15/23 at approximately 2153 hours, a white Chevy Cobalt with WV TAGS 5VC992 was observed leaving a residence in WV and traveling into MD. The residence the Cobalt left from, was where 2 suspects that fled from Troopers in MD hours prior were believed to be located. The suspects were William Lewis and Brittney Prunty. The operator of the Cobalt was Cody Baker from WV. It was alleged that Lewis pointed a firearm at a passenger in the vehicle that fled from Troopers earlier. CI information was provided to members of the GCNTF advising that they were at Bakers residence. Preston County Sheriffs Deputies observed the Cobalt leave Bakers residence and travel into MD. TFC Polland conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle, checking for the suspects. Baker was detained and questioned as to the location of Lewis and Prunty. Baker advised that they were inside his residence in WV. Baker provided consent to search his vehicle for drugs and a Firearm. Nothing was located in the vehicle. Preston County Sheriffs Deputies later executed a search and seizure warrant at Bakers residence. Lewis and Prunty were taken into custody and felony amounts of methamphetamine were located within close proximity to Lewis and Prunty.  Case closed.</NarrativeText>
