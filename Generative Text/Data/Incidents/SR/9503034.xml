         <NarrativeText>Status: Initial  Case Number: 23-MSP-011081  Narrative: This report has been prepared based upon the observations of this trooper and/or those of other troopers relative to the offense(s). The facts contained herein are intended solely to give the prosecuting authority a basic understanding of the facts pertaining to this case. The facts contained herein are not intended to be an exhaustive recitation of the facts pertaining to pretrial or trial issues. Instead, this trooper anticipates that during the pretrial proceedings in this case, the prosecutor will take the opportunity to interview this trooper in order to ascertain any and all relevant facts which might be the subject of this troopers testimony during court proceedings.    Introduction: On Tuesday, March 28, 2023, I, Trooper First Class Yocum #6934, conducted a traffic stop on southbound Interstate 95 at the mile marker 91.6, Cecil County, Maryland. I stopped a black 2022 Tesla Model 3 bearing Virginia registration: TWA2974, for impeding traffic. Upon making contact with the driver, Paula Shenelle Swann (DOB: 05/18/1994 B/F), who here in after will be referred to as Swann for the purpose of this report, and the front seat passenger, Laila Alexandria Lucas (DOB: 09/02/2003 B/F), who here in after will be referred to as Lucas for the purpose of this report, numerous indicators of criminal activity were observed. Through investigation, it was learned that Swann and Lucas were traveling from Cecil County, Maryland and destined for Baltimore City. MSP Pace Team and certified K-9 handler, deployed his drug detection canine partner Pascal and conducted a free air narcotic canine sniff of the Tesla. Pascal positively alerted to the odor of a narcotic and a probable cause search was conducted. During the probable cause search, I seized 1047.5 grams of suspected fentanyl from inside a black PUMA duffel bag located inside the trunk of the Tesla. The fentanyl was heat sealed and packaged into two bricks. One brick weighed 523.5 grams, and the other weighed 524 grams. Also located during the search was $2,231 in U.S. Currency. The $2,231 was located inside a purse sitting on the rear passenger seat of the Tesla. The amount of fentanyl seized far exceeds that of personal use and intended for distribution. The approximate street value of the seized fentanyl is approximately $30,000.  Axon Camera System In-Car and Body Worn Camera: In-Car Dash Camera: The in-car camera system is manufactured by Axon. When the emergency lights are activated in the patrol car, the camera will go back in time and start the recording 30 seconds before the emergency lights are activated. This is called a 30 second pre-record. The camera system does not have a date and time stamp on the video its self. The system records the date and time in the metadata. The time only records the hour and minute when the camera starts the recording. Therefore, the timeline below will start with a time that was recorded from the cameras metadata and then show the duration of the video.  Body Worn Camera: The body worn camera system is also manufactured by Axon. Upon the activation of emergency lights in the patrol vehicle, the camera will go back in time and start the recording 60 seconds before the emergency lights are activated. This is called a 60 second pre-record. The camera system does not have date and time stamp on the video its self. The system records the date and time in the metadata. The time only records hour and minute when the camera starts the recording. Therefore, the timeline below will start with a time that was recorded from the cameras metadata and then show the duration of the video.  The in-car and body camera remain the best depiction of the events surrounding the traffic stop. However, in order to obtain an exact time of a specific event, the reader will have to add the length of duration from the start of the video that was recorded in the metadata. Although times are recorded by other means such as the Delta plus system that prints a time stamp on the warning; citation or safety equipment repair order this time is only when the traffic stop button is activated by the Trooper. This can sometimes be shortly after making contact with a violator. Other programs such as Caliber RMS incident and CAD reports will show a timestamp but this time depends on when the Police Communications Officer activates the incident. The two aforementioned examples of the recording of time will almost always be different than the in-car camera system due to all of the systems utilizing different internal clocks.  Timeline:   12:21 PM To Pre-record of the video begins. The time is obtained from metadata.  45 seconds from the start of the video, the Tesla comes to a stop (time of stop).  1 minute, 29 seconds from the start of the video, I introduce myself to both occupants of Tesla. I advised the traffic stop is being audibly and visually recorded, and request the drivers drivers license and the registration card for the vehicle.  2 minutes, 23 seconds from the start of the video, I request Cpl. Hirsch to the scene.  2 minutes, 55 seconds from the start of the video, Cpl. Hirsch arrives on scene.  3 minutes from the start of the video, I return to my patrol vehicle.  3 minutes, 11 seconds from the start of the video, I call out the traffic stop to the JFK Highway Barrack.  7 minutes, 4 seconds from the start of the video, Cpl. Hirsch advised a K9 scan was to be conducted.  8 minutes, 4 seconds from the start of the video, I advised the JFK Highway Barrack of a positive K9 scan, and to start me a card for a probable cause search.  8 minutes, 58 seconds from the start of the video, I begin the probable cause search of the Tesla.  11 minutes, 25 seconds from the start of the video, I locate the contraband in the trunk of the Tesla.  11 minutes, 34 seconds from the start of the video, the driver and passenger are both placed under arrest.  18 minutes, 23 seconds from the start of the video, I clear the scene with the driver in custody and begin transport to JFK Highway Barrack.  27 minutes from the start of the video, I arrive at the JFK Highway Barrack with the driver and transport ends.  35 minutes, 25 seconds from the start of the video, a female Cecil County Deputy begins secondary search of drivers person. This concludes my body cam footage.    Assignment: On Tuesday, March 28, 2023I, Troop First Class Yocum #6934 of the Maryland State Police, Pro-Active Criminal Enforcement team was assigned to work in Cecil County, Maryland. The Pro-Active Criminal Enforcement team is a team of specially trained Troopers designed to locate criminals through traffic enforcement. The idea is that the Troopers will be aggressive and diligent during their enforcement efforts and conduct the complete traffic stop. The objective is to reduce the number of motor vehicle collisions and locate criminals.  The Traffic Violation: I was sitting stationary at the 91.6 mile marker, conducting laser speed enforcement on the southbound flow of Interstate 95 traffic while operating my Maryland State Police issued patrol vehicle CE-63. The traffic conditions were heavy as traffic was flowing at approximately 65 to 70 miles per hour. At this time, my attention was directed to a black 2022, Tesla Model 3, displaying Virginia registration TWA2974 traveling in lane 2. I observed the Tesla to break aggressively, causing the front end of the Tesla to dip towards the ground. I directed my LIDAR unit (Pro Lase IV) at the Tesla and obtained a speed reading of 54 miles per hour at 243 feet in a posted 65 mile per hour zone. I am certified through the Maryland State Police to operate LIDAR, and the LIDAR unit was tested before and after the stop and found to be working properly. Due to the abrupt, and aggressive braking of the Tesla, the vehicle impeded the normal flow of traffic. Also, the aggressive braking nearly caused a collision with a silver Acura SUV which was traveling behind the Tesla. I exited the crossover and purused the was able to position my vehicle behind the Tesla as we were driving across the Millard E. Tydings Bridge. While traveling on the bridge, there was a heavy flow of traffic behind us as the Tesla was traveling at approximately 48 mph. Upon crossing the bridge into Harford County, I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on the Tesla. Upon activating my emergency lights, the Tesla abruptly braked while in lane 2, then slowly drifted to the right shoulder and came to a complete stop on southbound Interstate 95 at mile marker 90, Harford County, Maryland.  The Traffic Stop: I approached the Tesla on the passenger side. This type of approach is one that affords me the ability to observe more of the suspect (s) and the interior of the vehicle. This provides a tactical advantage for my safety. As I made my approach, I observed there to be two occupants, Swann as the driver, and Lucas as the passenger. I introduced myself, advised the traffic stop was being audibly and visually recorded. I explained the reason for the traffic stop and requested Swanns drivers license and the registration card for the vehicle. Swann appeared to be extremely anxious while retrieving the requested documents as she rummaged through the center console area. This seemed suspicious to me because the inside of the Tesla was very clean and tidy. Swann advised the Tesla was a rental vehicle, and as she provided me the rental agreement she displayed signs of nervousness as her left hand appeared to be tremoring. Swann then handed me her driver with her right hand, and as she did, I observed it to be also tremoring. While speaking with Swann, the passenger, Lucas, did not speak a single word to me. At this time, I had Swann exit the Tesla and walk to the front of my patrol cruiser to explain the reason for the traffic stop. As I met Swann at the front of my patrol vehicle, I requested Cpl. Hirsch to the scene. I then Swann asked if she was the renter of the Tesla, to which she advised she was. I asked Swann if she understood the reason for the traffic stop, to which she stated, yeah, my battery is dying. Swann advised her battery was at 13% and she was looking for a place to charge it. As I observed Swanns drivers license, I noticed her address was Baltimore City, which I know is a well-known city for the distribution of narcotics. I advised Swann to stay put and I would re-initiate contact with her shorty. As I returned to my patrol vehicle, Cpl. Hirsch along with his drug detection canine partner Pascal arrived on scene as back up. I had suspicions that Swann and Lucas were involved in criminal activity. My suspicions were based on the above state indicators. The observations were inconsistent with normal interstate travel, and more indicative of criminal activity. As I began calling out the traffic stop to the JFK Highway Barrack. I informed them of my traffic stop, asked them to conduct a drivers license and wanted check on Swann. I began my electronic warning on the E-tix program for the impeding traffic violation. While I filled in the information for my electronic warning on the E-Tix program, Cpl. Hirsch began speaking with both the Swann and Lucas separately. As I completed the business needs of the traffic stop, Cpl Hirsch had Lucas exit the Tesla, and had her take a seat on the guardrail besides Swann. Cpl. Hirsch then walked back to my vehicle, and advised me while speaking with both occupants he also observed numerous indicators of criminal activity (SEE SUPPLEMENT). Cpl. Hirsch then advised he was going to retrieve Pascal. As I entered the information into the E-Tix program, Cpl. Hirsch deployed Pascal and conducted a free air narcotic canine sniff. Pascal positively alerted to the odor of a narcotic. Subsequently, a probable cause search would be conducted. It should be noted that the time of the canine sniff, it was approximately 8 minutes, 4 seconds into the traffic stop. I was still conducting the normal business needs of the stop.  The Search I exited from my patrol vehicle as Cpl Hirsch explained the positive alert and probable cause search to Swann and Lucas. I started the search on the front passenger side door. I noticed numerous white plastic bags, but they were empty. Upon the arrival of additional units, Cpl. Hirsch assisted me with searching the Tesla. As Cpl. Hirsch opened the trunk of the Tesla, he observed a gray Under Armour backpack. At that time, I retrieved a black PUMA duffel bag from inside the back pack. Upon lifting the duffel bag, it felt heavy as if there was something inside it. I opened the duffel bag and immediately observed two heat-sealed bricks, each containing a white powdery substance, suspected fentanyl. I was able to identify the heat-sealed bricks as fentanyl through my training, knowledge, and experience as a State Trooper from numerous CDS arrests. I also know through my training, knowledge, and experience that fentanyl is a schedule II controlled dangerous substance. Cpl. Hirsch placed Lucas in handcuffs, and I placed Swann in handcuffs. Both were arrested without incident.   Upon retrieving my agency issued iPhone to photograph the scene, Cpl Hirsch and I located a pursue on the rear passenger seat. Inside the purse was a wallet which contained $2,231 in U.S. Currency. The dominations were as follows: 3 -$100-dollar bills, 5 - $50 dollar bills, 70 - $20 dollar bills, and 281  $1 dollar bills. The currency packaged in large stacks, and by rubber bands. Due to the large dominations of $1- and $20-dollar bills, and how it was packaged, I had suspicion to believe the currency was obtained from illegal drug transactions.  I was able to retrieve two iPhones from scene, both were placed on airplane mode, and given to the taskforce for digital download. Upon completion of the search, I secured the narcotics and U.S. currency in the trunk of my patrol cruiser. I secured Swann in the front seat of my patrol cruiser, while Trooper Myers secured Lucas in his patrol vehicle, and transported her to the JFK Highway, while Cpl. Hirsch waited for the tow truck.  Post Arrest Investigation Upon arriving at the barrack, both Swann and Lucas were searched by a female Cecil County Deputy, which yielded negative results. Collettes Towing had towed the vehicle from the scene and transported it back to their lot. I contacted Hertz Rental Car (Catonsville Office) and advised them of where the vehicle was and how to obtain it.  Swann and Lucas were both asked if they wanted to cooperate, but both refused and no interview was conducted.  While removing the two heat-sealed bricks from the PUMA duffel bag, I observed an All State insurance card in the bottom of the bag. The insurance card was issued to Dawn Ramon, 1441 Riverside Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19154 (SEE ATTACHEMENTS).  Cpl. Hirsch, and I processed the CDS and U.S. Currency. Each of the heat-sealed bricks were weighed: A-523.5 grams / B-524 grams, verified by Cpl. Hirsch, and processed for evidence/CDS analysis under Property Held Number: P-342092.Since U.S. currency had been gained through illicit proceeds, it was seized and was taken custody of by Sgt. McNeely of MADTF.  Upon completion of processing, I transported to Lucas to the Cecil County Commissioners Office for her initial appearance. TFC McDonald transported to Swann. Both defendants were held without bond. They were each transported and released to the Cecil County Detention Center.  I request this case be closed. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 3/28/20023 I was requested to respond to a traffic stop TFC Yocum made on S/B I-95 at the 90MM. When I arrived, I observed him on the right shoulder with a black Tesla passenger vehicle pulled over and a female standing on the shoulder in front of his vehicle.  I approached the female, Paula Swann, and entered into a conversation with her. During my conversation, I observed her demeanor to be overly nervous and more so than the normal motoring public. Swann appeared to have a hard time sitting still and did not make eye contact but constantly looked back at the vehicle. Swann also rubbed her face and eyes anytime she answered a question. Swann advised me the vehicle was a rental car that she had rented. When asked about her trip, Swann stated that she came to Cecil County to I met somebody. While saying this, she looked away from me and her voice trailed off. I found this response and demeanor change to be extremely odd. I then asked Swann who was in the vehicle with her, and she stated my roommate.  I then contacted the passenger of the vehicle, Laila Lucas. As I walked up to the window, Lucas was holding 2 cell phones. I could see one was connected to a FaceTime call and the other a phone call. Lucas held 1 phone up to her head and while never saying a word acted as if she was listening. Lucas stared straight ahead and did not acknowledge my presence. At several points, Lucas held both phones to her ears. I began speaking to Lucas who stated they were just out riding around. When I asked her how she knew the driver she stated shes my best friend. While speaking to Lucas, she displayed excessively nervous behavior. Her carotid pulse was visible in her neck, she avoided eye contact and her legs were rapidly bouncing. I also observed a white plastic bag on the floor that Lucas appeared to be trying to conceal with her legs. I asked Lucas to exit the vehicle and as she did, she pushed the bag under the seat.  After talking to Swann and Lucas, my suspicions were elevated, and I believed criminal activity was afoot. I advised TFC Yocum that I would conduct a free air k9 sniff while he continued the business needs of the traffic stop. The scan resulted in a positive alert, for details of the scan see K9 usage report.  I then stood with Swann and Lucas additional units arrived. At that time, I began searching the Tesla with TFC Yocum. When I arrived at the trunk I located a gray backpack. Inside the backpack was a black duffle bag. I advised TFC Yocum, I had located it, and he opened the bag revealing 2 heat-sealed packages of compressed off-white powder. I then placed Lucas in handcuffs.  At the Barrack, I assisted in completing paperwork for the evidence. This concluded my involvement in the case.</NarrativeText>
