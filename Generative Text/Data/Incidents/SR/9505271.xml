         <NarrativeText>Witnesses:   Sergeant Connolly / 2338 /  Criminal Interdiction Specialist, K9 Handler PACE Team  15 Turnpike Drive  Perryville MD 21903   This witness assisted in the traffic stop by completing the free air K9 scan of the vehicle.   NARRATIVE:    Introduction:  I, Cpl Hirsch conducted a traffic stop on a Silver Tesla on Owings Mills Blvd. During the traffic stop, numerous criminal indicators led me to believe that criminal activity was afoot. This was based upon my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. I requested a canine scan of the vehicle resulting in a positive alert which led to the search of the vehicle. During the search of the vehicle, I located a bulk amount of rubber banded Unites States Currency inside a black bag, approximately $200,000. Also located in the rear cargo area was a black contractor sized trash bag that contained numerous clear, cut cellophane wrappers smeared with axle grease.   Assignment:   On Wednesday May 3, 2023 I, Cpl Hirsch, of the Maryland State Police, Pro-Active Criminal Enforcement team was assigned to work Interstate Liberty Road in Baltimore County Maryland. The Pro-Active Criminal Enforcement team is a team of specially trained Troopers designed to locate criminals through traffic enforcement. The idea is that the Troopers will be aggressive and diligent during their enforcement efforts and conduct the complete traffic stop. The objective is to reduce the number of motor vehicle collisions and locate criminals.  The Traffic Violation:    On that date, at approximately 1558 hours, I was traveling on west bound on Liberty Road in the area of Owings Mills Blvd. While patrolling my attention was directed to a silver Tesla SUV bearing MD registration 51979CH. A routine check of the registration plate on my in-car computer revealed the registration expired 11/2022. I also observed the front windows of the vehicle to be tinted darker the allowed by Maryland law. The Traffic Stop:  I activated my emergency equipment with the intent to stop the silver Tesla violation of the Maryland Motor Vehicle Law: TA-13-411(f) Displaying expired registration plates. The Tesla came to a stop in the right lane of Owings Mills Blvd. I exited my patrol car and approached the Tesla on the passenger side.   The approach on the passenger side is an approach that affords me the ability to observe more of the suspect and the interior of the vehicle. This provides a tactical advantage for my safety.   As I arrived at the passenger side window, I noticed that the driver was the only person occupying the vehicle. I identified myself and the reason for the stop. The Driver handed me a Maryland Drivers License and I identified him to be Curtis Lamonte Phillips. Phillips stated he did not have the registration card for the vehicle and made no attempt to locate the document. While I was conversing with Phillips about the traffic violation, I made several observations. Phillips had a nervous demeanor; his voice was shaking and he shifted around unable to it still. Phillips kept placing his hand on a black back pack that was located on the front passenger seat. There was a cell phone connected to a video call laying on the front seat. I also observed a large amount of rubber bands in the cup holders on the center arm rest. All these observations were not typical of the motoring public and led me to believe criminal activity was afoot. Phillips requested to exit the vehicle and look at the license plates, and he came to the rear of the vehicle. During this time, Sgt Connolly arrived at my location.  Sgt Connolly spoke briefly with Phillips and I informed her of the observations I had made and asked that Sgt Connolly conduct a free air K9 scan. I called out the stop location, vehicle tag, and drivers license information to the Golden Ring Barrack. Sgt Connolly conducted a free air scan with certified narcotics detection K9 Riley due to the fact I believed that the driver was engaged in criminal activity. My suspicions were based on the totality of the circumstances and not in isolation paired with my training, knowledge, and experience. I opened a card for the K9 Scan through the Golden Ring Barrack   I advised the Golden Ring Barrack K-9 Riley alerted to the vehicle for the odor of narcotics. It should be noted, at the time of the alert, I was still in my vehicle typing the written warning for the traffic violation, as the business of the traffic stop was still ongoing. I had also not received any information back from the Golden Ring Barrack as to the Drivers License status, however it was confirmed the vehicle plate was expired.  The Search:   I began a warrantless probable cause search of the vehicle. I began my search at the drivers side front and when I opened the center console, I located several rubber banded stacks of US currency. In the second row seats, I located a black back pack backpack containing a digital scale and plastic baggies. The backpack had the overwhelming odor of Cocaine. In the rear cargo area, I located a cooler. A search of the cooler revealed a bulk amount of rubber banded Unites States Currency located inside a black bag, approximately $200,000. Also located in the rear cargo area was a black contractor sized trash bag that contained numerous clear, cut cellophane wrappers smeared with axle grease. Based on my training, knowledge and drug interdiction experience I know that the cut cellophane wrappers were indicative of the possession of numerous kilograms of CDS. Phillips was detained without incident. The Post Arrest Investigation:   Investigators from DEA Group 51 arrived at the scene of the traffic stop. I relayed to them what I located and they immediately began writing a search warrant for Phillips residence. Due to the nature of the crime, DEA investigators seized the US Currency, CDS packaging materials and vehicle. Phillips was also turned over to the custody of the DEA pending the result of the search warrant. All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland    CASE CLOSED. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>MODE OF OPERATION: Probable cause exists to believe that the $199,960.00 and the $10,000.00 are proceeds from illegal drug trafficking.  SUSPECT(S):  DEA #GC-20-0016  SHORTER, Mista-Robert Lee-Phillip; AA/M; DOB 8/28/1994; 199994 Santa Rosa Dr., Detroit, MI 48221  SHORTER, Janaurd Randelle; AA/M; DOB 8/3/1993; 2961 E. Lafayette St., Detroit, MI 48221  SEIZED: 6/15/2023  ASSET ID #: 23-DEA-703855 - $10,000.00 USC ASSET ID #: 23-DEA-703857 - $199,960.00 USC  On June 15, 2023, investigators of the DEA HIDTA Group 51 requested the MSP PACE Team assist with an investigation which resulted in the seizure of the $199,960.00 USC and $10,000.00 USC in Baltimore City, MD. Probable cause exists to believe that the money is proceeds from that illegal drug trafficking. Refer to DEA case #GC-20-0016 for additional information.  I completed an electronic DAG-71 for each of the above seizures requesting a % of the proceeds. DEA will determine the percentage that MSP receives. The DAG-71 was submitted on August 8, 2023. A supplemental report will be written documenting the disposition of the assets upon adjudication of the case. This case is suspended regarding the assets seized in this case.  M/Tpr.
