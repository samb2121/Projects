         <NarrativeText>**Incident recorded by issued body-worn camera**  VICTIM/ COMPLAINANT:  -William Bruce Howsare Sex: Male Race: White DOB: 10/08/1974   WITNESS:  -Leonard Eugene Howsare Sex: Male Race: White DOB: 08/21/1936   SUSPECT:  -Jeremiah Louis Howsare Sex: Male Race: White DOB: 06/24/1981   NARRATIVE:    On August 29, 2023, at 1550 hr, I, Senior Trooper K. Preston (#6305) responded to 18622 Cherry Lane,Frostburg for a report of an assault. I arrived at the residence and met with the victim/ complainant, William Bruce Howsare. William stated his father, Leonard Eugene Howsare lives at this residence, and he stopped by to help him with a problem with his television. William said after he was done helping Leonard and left the residence out the front door and started walking towards his vehicle parked in the driveway. William said his cousin and Leonards neighbor, Jeremiah Louis Howsare was on his lawn mower cutting the grass at his residence. Jeremiah was yelling obscenity at William. William recorded this with his cell phone and entered his vehicle. William said Jeremiah drove his lawn mower in behind his vehicle in a manner that William could not back up to enter the roadway to leave. Jeremiah then got off the lawn mower and began to hit Williams vehicle with his hands/fists. William said he exited his vehicle and once he was out Jeremiah hit him twice on the right side of his face with a closed fist. A verbal argument ensued and Leonard exited the house to see what was going on. Jeremiah then got back on his lawn mower and went back to his property. William then called 911 to report the assault. As we stood there Jeremiah was at his residence still operating the lawn mower. Both William and Leonard were concerned for Jeremiahs mental health. They explained that they have had multiple incidents over the past year. They advised anytime Jeremiah feels slighted he blames them for it, though they have no involvement in the event. William stated Jeremiah calls him demon and cussing him of being on licit drugs. William advised he is currently enrolled in to a local college to become an addiction counselor. I asked William if he wants Jeremiah charged, and he said no, but felt something should be done to stop the ongoing harassment of himself and Leonard. I advised William that he can apply for charges for the assault at the Allegany County District Court Commissioners Office, if he changes his mind. I advised both William and Leonard to seek a peace/ protective order fromAllegany County District Court Commissioners Office. I then provided them with a case number and my contact information.    I went to Jeremiahs residence (18632 Cherry Lane) and spoke with him (The entire interview was captured by my body-worn camera). Jeremiah stated that this was an ongoing issue between him William, and Leonard. Jeremiah stated William had embarrassed him at Rocky Casino in front of a female friend and that within the past few months William attempted to assault him as he was cutting grass in the front yard of his residence. I asked Jeremiah what happened today, and stated William was at his car dilly-dallying and recording him with his phone. He said they began to argue and William brought up Jeremiahs deceased father and this residence that belonged to his father. Jeremiah then drove his lawn mower behind William. Jeremiah stated I told him to get the hell out his car and start running his mouth now about my fathers house. Then he ended up getting out his car, and we jawed and had an argument and a spat. He said he was calling the cops, and he called the cops. I asked if anything physical happened. Jeremiah then tried to bring up the incident that happened in the past not directly related to this incident. I then advised I am taking about todays incident. He stated there is some physical stuff. He is not saying, nothing about my father or my fathers house. He is not disrespecting me like that. He then stated things about Leonard and William that were unrelated. I stated he said it got physical and asked him how. He stated he was talking crap on my dad. I said that was verbal not physical and again asked how it got physical. He stated I had enough of him. I stated so?. He stated He [William] said do something about it. I then said I assumed you did?. He replied he deserved it! One hundred percent! I asked him to what extent?. He replied just a shot to his face. I asked just one?. He replied there was two. I then explained to Jeremiah that William can seek charges against him for this incident. I also explained to him that he can seek a peace/ protective order against William and Leonard atthe Allegany County District Court Commissioners Office. I provided him with a case number and my contact information.    All the above events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.    I request this case be closed due to at this time the victim does not wish any further action.      </NarrativeText>
