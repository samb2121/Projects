         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report  (For review by the MSPCrash Team)       Section I. - Introduction:  On Friday, April 21, 2023, at approximately 2128hours, the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack received a call of a motor vehicle collision involving two vehicles and a pedestrian. Due to the nature of the collision, I, Trooper First Class B. White #6931, an Advanced Collision Investigator (ACI) assigned to the Forestville Barrack, was requested to respond to assume the investigation. Upon my arrival at the scene, I observed Prince Georges County Fire Department and Paramedics were clearing the scene. Maryland State College Park Barrack Troopers had lanes number one (1) through four (4) shut down. The collision involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Camry bearing Maryland registration 2EF0570 operated by Moctar Moustapha Tall (African American/male, DOB:06/14/1998), of Rockville, Maryland, and a black Ford Explorer bearing Maryland registration 7ew9219 operated by Darrell William Brooks Sr. (African American/male, DOB: 4/23/1995), of Randallstown, Maryland. The silver Toyota was positionedon the left shoulder of the roadway and the black Ford Explorer was positioned in lane number 2. The pedestrian, Mark Anthony Bumbry (African American/male, DOB: 07/18/1961) was positioned in front of the Ford Explorer in lane number 2. No witnesses remained on scene.  I then proceeded to process and document the scene and take digital photographs.     Section II. - Scene Description: (The following descriptions are based on the area where the collision occurred.)  Primary Roadway: Interstate 95 (I-95) was a divided highway that traveled in a north/south direction. The northbound lanes were separated from the southbound lanes by a grassy center median affixed with aguardrail.The northbound side of Interstate 95 was a four-lane highway. Each lane was separated by a broken white lane line. Lane number 1 was separated from lane number 2 by a broken white lane line. Lane number 2 was separated from lane number 3 by a broken white lane line. And lane number 3 was separated from lane number 4 by a broken white lane line. The roadway was essentially straight and level. The road markings appeared to be bright and in good condition. The road surface was dry and appeared to be free from any contributory defects. The posted speed limit was 65 miles-per-hour.    Secondary Roadway (if applicable): N/A   Environmental Conditions:  The weather conditions at the time of the collision were dark skies/partly cloudy. The collision occurred during the night hours. There were streetlights present in the direct area where the collision occurred. There did not appear to be any visible sight obstructions that could have contributed to this collision.I then checked Weather Underground which provides historical weather data. Sunset was at 1951 hours and the skies were clear. The astronomy at the time of the collision was a waxing crescent moon.A waxing crescent moon is generally 92% invisible. Since the astronomy was a waxing crescent moon, there would have been a lack of moonlight reflectivity which could have illuminated the area more.     Section III. - Scene Evidence:  I surveyed the scene in an effort to locate, identify, and analyze any roadway evidence which would be useful in the investigation. I did not observe any evidence of pre-impact tire marks or cleaning marks.A gouge mark from the areaof impact was not observed. The deceased finger was located approximately 305 feet from where vehicle 2 came to final rest, in lane number 2, and 628 feet from where vehicle 1 came to final rest, on the left shoulder of the roadway. Utilizing digital photography, 62 photographs of the entire scene and vehicles involved were taken. Measurements were taken by hand utilizing a measuring wheel. The area of impact was determined to be in lane number 2 based on the scene evidence which included the deceased finger in the roadway.      Section IV. - Vehicle(s) Involved:  Vehicle #1:  2016 Toyota Camry (VIN #: 4TBBF1FK3GR543384) The silver Toyota Camry was displaying Maryland registration 7EW9219.

The front passenger side of the vehicles windshield sustained heavy damage. The passenger side roof of the vehicle sustained two dents near the top of passenger side door as well as blood on the rear door and window on the passenger side. The front passenger windshield damage was initiated in the front where the initial impact with pedestrian occurred. (reference photographIMG-4620.jpg, IMG-4622.jpg,IMG-4625.jpg)  Vehicle #2:  2020 black Ford Explorer (VIN #: 1FM5K8GC0LGB33489) The black Ford Explorer was displaying Maryland registration 57EW9212. The vehicle was registered to Darrell William Brooks Sr. (African American/male, DOB: 4/23/1995) The Ford Explorer was positioned in its position of controlled final rest in lane number 2. The Ford Explorer sustained heavy front-end damage in the front and driver side windshield. The front-end damage was initiated in the front due to the initial impact from the pedestrian.

Section V. - Person(s) Involved:  Person #1:  Pedestrian: (Deceased): Mark Anthony Bumbry (African American/male, DOB: 07/18/1961), of Hyattsville, Maryland.
