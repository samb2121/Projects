Mowbray #7119: partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline"&gt;https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=0c73d743832e41a7a115d8db04df62f1partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  CAMERA SYSTEM / CAD SYSTEM / DELTA PLUS The camera system is manufactured by Axon. The in-car; outward facing camera is activated when the emergency lights are activated in the patrol car or if manually activated by the user. The camera will go back in time and start the recording thirty (30) seconds before the camera is activated. This event is called a 30 second pre-record. The body worn camera (BWC); attached to the front of the Trooper, is also activated when the emergency lights are activated or manually by its user. The camera will record the previous sixty (60) seconds prior to the camera activation.  The camera system does not have a date and time stamp on the video itself. The system records the date and time in the metadata. The time only records the hour and minute when the camera starts the recording. Therefore, the timeline below will start with a time that was recorded from the cameras metadata and then show the duration of the video. The in-car camera and body worn camera footage remains the best depiction of the events surrounding the traffic stop. However, in order to obtain an exact time of a specific event, the reader will have to add the length of duration from the start of the video that was recorded in the metadata. Although times are recorded by other means such as the Delta Plus system that prints a time stamp on the warning, citation or safety equipment repair order this time is only when the traffic enforcement button is activated by the Trooper. This date/time is usually started shortly after making contact with a violator and upon return to the patrol vehicle. Other programs such as Caliber RMS incident and CAD reports will show a timestamp, but this time depends on when the Police Communications Operator or Trooper activates the incident within the CAD system. The two aforementioned examples of the recording of time will almost always be different than the in-car camera system due to all of the systems utilizing different internal clocks.  DUI FOLDER NUMBER: 23-58-253 DEFENDANT:  Garrett Evan Roe DOB: 07/01/1995 1218 Stone Boundary Road, Cambridge, Dorchester County, Maryland 21613 SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER: NO DATE OF ARREST: 12/02/2023 TIME OF ARREST: 0212 hours  CERTIFICATIONS AND TRAINING:    Graduate of the Maryland State Police Academy - July 2019  Trained in the detection and recognition of controlled dangerous substances through the Maryland State Police Academy  Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - May 2019  Trained and certified to operate the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) through the Maryland State Police - May 2019  Trained and certified to operate Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center License Plate Readers - August 2019  Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.) - January 2020  Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police  Attended the Maryland State Police Conducting the Complete Traffic Stop: Criminal Interdiction Training - February 2020  Trained in Advanced Collision Investigations by the Maryland State Police - June 2021  Attended the Maryland State Police Cannabis Impairment Detection Workshop - May 2023  Attended the Maryland Impaired Driving Conference - November 2023  ASSIGNMENT: On Saturday, December 2, 2023, I, Trooper First Class M. Mowbray #7119, of the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, was assigned to road patrol duties in Dorchester County, Maryland. The Maryland State Police Easton Barrack is responsible for enforcing and investigating all criminal and traffic related crime within Dorchester, Talbot and Caroline counties. My duties include but are not limited to: enforcing the criminal and motor vehicle laws of the State of Maryland, issuing traffic citations and warnings, investigating traffic accidents, investigating and completing criminal investigations, interviewing witnesses, victims and suspects and writing field reports.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On December 2, 2023, at approximately 2202 hours, I was on patrol operating my unmarked Maryland State Police patrol vehicle I-12; a 2022 Ford Explorer, traveling westbound on Maryland Route 392 (East New Market Bypass) approaching the intersection of Maryland Route 16 (Mount Holly Road). At that time, I observed a silver 2016 Chevrolet Silverado bearing Maryland registration 64827HT traveling westbound directly in front of me, merging onto Maryland Route 16. While observing the Maryland registration plate I noted that the red month tab was not visible in the top left-hand corner of the registration plate, or on the plate, as required by the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. As the Chevrolet traveled westbound approaching Hicksburg Road, I observed it to drift to the right and watched as both tires on its right side crossed the solid white pavement mark by over a tires width; failing to obey properly placed traffic control device instructions. The Chevrolet then drifted to the left back into its lane as it continued westbound, then drifted back to the right crossing the solid white pavement mark with its right tires by more than a tires width before drifting back to the left into its lane for the second time. As the Chevrolet approached the intersection of Green Point Road, I observed it to drift from left to right within its lane, failing to maintain its stability within the lane. After the Chevrolet passed the intersection of Green Point Road I observed it to drift to the left and drive directly onto the solid double yellow center line with its left tires before drifting back to the right. As the Chevrolet continued westbound approaching the intersection of Fox Run Road, I observed it to cross the solid white pavement mark with its right tires and by a few inches before drifting back to the left into its lane for the third time. As the Chevrolet approached the intersection of Fox Run Road I observed it to drift to the right and cross the dashed white line for the right turn lane and drive with a quarter of the vehicle in the lane and over the then solid white pavement mark before drifting back to the left and into its lane for the fourth time.   I then immediately initiated a lawful traffic stop of the vehicle by activating my emergency equipment which consists of red, blue, and white strobe lights and siren. As the Chevrolet applies its brake lights, I observed the center high stop lamp to be inactive and not functioning. The Chevrolet pulled to the right and came to a stop on the shoulder of Maryland Route 16 near the intersection of Indian Grant Road.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I exited my patrol vehicle and approached Chevrolet from the drivers side and attempted to make contact with the driver while standing near the B-pillar of the vehicle. The driver; later identified as Garrett Evan Roe (DOB: 07/01/1995) [hereinafter identified as Roe], appeared to be moving around looking for something then stated; Hang on a second. Roe then opened the hydraulic doors to the left side of the Chevrolet at which point he stated; I do apologize, the window does not open. Whats going on? What happened? I then introduced myself, advised Roe that the encounter was being audibly and visually recorded and advised him of the reason for the traffic stop. Roe stated; I thought I was doing fine. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the Chevrolet. I also observed Roes eyes to be bloodshot and glassy; indicative of the consumption of alcoholic beverages. I requested Roe to provide me with his drivers license to which he replied; My license is right in my pocket. While Roe was retrieving his drivers license I asked how his evening was going to which he stated; Man, not bad. Im just coming back from Johnnys Tavern, trying to get back to the house. I was up there seeing a boy that I just met the other night. Roe the provided me with his Maryland drivers license and additional paperwork. While speaking with Roe I also observed his speech to be slurred; also indicative of the consumption of alcoholic beverages. I then asked Roe if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages to which he replied; Ive had a couple tonight, last one about two hours ago. I then instructed Roe to remain with the Chevrolet while I returned to my patrol vehicle.   I then returned to my patrol vehicle and began conducting checks of Roe and the Chevrolet and relayed all pertinent information to the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack Emergency Dispatcher.   Notation: Roe was seated within a motorized chair within the drivers compartment. The Chevrolet doors had been modified to open on a hydraulic system due to Roes disability. Johnnys Tavern is a known establishment that sells alcohol in a bar setting in East New Market.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) I then returned to the Chevrolet and requested that Roe exit his vehicle and submit to the battery of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, to which he complied. I then instructed Roe to move to the front of the Chevrolet, to which he complied.  I then began Standardized Field Sobriety Tests; which yielded the following results;  The test was performed on the asphalt roadway on Maryland Route 16. The surface was dry, level and free from any debris. Lighting consisted of my flashlight, headlights and street lamps. My front red/blue lights were deactivated, and spotlight was pointed downward prior to the test. The weather was clear, evening time, and 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Roe was wearing boots, blue jeans and a gray t-shirt as he remained seated within his motorized chair. As Roe continued to speak with me, I detected the same odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person and noticed his speech to be slurred. I then asked Roe how much alcoholic he consumed prior to operating a motor vehicle to which he stated; Ive had three beers since the time I showed up at Johnnys Tavern about nine forty-five, were sitting here about two oclock now. Three beers, couple shots. I asked Roe what type of alcoholic beverages he consumed to which he replied; They were Miller Lite they were combination of ten ounce cans and twelve ounce bottles. I think it was, let me see if I can get this right, couple cans, ten ounce, couple twelve ounce and they was two shots like one ounce pours of Fireball. I then asked Roe to estimate the time between when he last consumed an alcoholic beverage to now to which he replied; About an hour twenty.   I then asked if Roe had any physical disabilities, medical issues and/or on any medications that would prevent him from successfully completed the tests(eyes/balance), by asking the following medical screening questions; Q: I see you where glasses, are they glasses or corrective lenses? A: Yes, prescription. Yes sir. Q: Do you have any corrective lenses in, any contacts, or just the glasses? A: I think, yeah, just the glasses. Q: Have you ever had a concussion? A: Not to my knowledge. Q: I see you are in a chair, you cannot stand up, correct? A: Correct Q: Do you have a resting nystagmus? A: I think I have a stigmatism in one eye, I cannot remember which one.  The first test administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. I held an ink pen 12-15 inches in front of Roe face and slightly above eye level. Roe was checked to ensure that his eyes could track the pens movement equally. Additionally, I ensured there was no resting nystagmus and that his pupils were equal in size.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6 of 6 Clues) (EYE COLOR: Blue) 1.) LACK OF SMOOTH PURSUIT - Present - 1 clue 2.) DISTINCT AND SUSTAINED NYSTAGMUS AT MAXIMUM DEVIATION - Present - 1 clue 3.) ONSET OF NYSTAGMUS PRIOR TO 45 DEGREES - Present - 1 clue VERTICAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS - Not present  WALK AND TURN (0 of 8 Clues)  NOT OFFERED / NOT COMPLETED  Notation: Roe does not have the use of his legs, therefore, the walk and turn test could not be applied.   ONE LEG STAND (0 of 4 Clues) NOT OFFERED / NOT COMPLETED  Notation: Roe does not have the use of his legs, therefore, the one leg stand test could not be applied.   ADDITIONAL FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS: ALPHABET TEST (F-T): Roe was asked what his highest level of education was to which he replied; Bachelors, Salisbury University. Ive got some graduate education at American University. Roe was also asked if he was familiar with the alphabet. Roe was asked to recite the alphabet starting with the letter F and ending with the letter T. Roe agreed to perform the Alphabet Test with the following results:  F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T      margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Correctly completed  NUMBERS TEST (59-36): Roe was asked if he was familiar and comfortable with counting numbers backwards. He was instructed to count backwards from 59 to 36. Roe agreed to perform the test with the following results:  59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 50, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39     margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Incorrectly completed  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST RESULTS: The Preliminary Breath Test was offered to Roe at the scene. I advised Roe of the State of Maryland Preliminary Breath Test Advisement of Rights prior to the test. Result: REFUSED  METERS/NCIC CHECKS: After conducting checks of Roe via the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and Maryland Electronic Telecommunications Resource System (METERS); it was learned that Roe possessed a valid Class C drivers license in the State of Maryland.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Roe was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. - Driver failure to obey a properly placed traffic control device, on four separate occasions - Driver failing to maintain lane - Driver failing to drive right of center - Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from interior of the vehicle - Strong odor of alcohol emanating from his breath and person - Eyes bloodshot and glassy - Admission to the consumption of alcoholic beverages prior to operating a motor vehicle - My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests  ARREST: Due to Roes poor performance on the battery of the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, he was placed under arrest at 0212 hours for driving under the influence. Roes mouth was checked to ensure it was free from any foreign objects. Roe was continuously polite and cooperative through the entire encounter. Roe was not placed in handcuffs due to the fact that he did not have a left hand.   SEARCH INCIDENT TO ARREST: A search incident to arrest was conducted on the Chevrolet and the areas that were accessible to Roe as he operated the motor vehicle. The search revealed no notable findings.  ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)/ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION TEST: While seated within his motorized chair and at the front of the Chevrolet, I played the DR-15 Advice of Rights (Alcohol Concentration Test) English Audio provided by the State of Maryland at 0215 hours as I stood to his left. Roe was also provided with a copy of the DR-15 to read along, which he held in front of him. Roe agreed to submit to the chemical alcohol concentration test at 0223 hours. Roe was transported to the Cambridge Police Department; located 8 Washington Street, Cambridge, Maryland and processed in accordance with departmental policy. After the observation time was completed, Sergeant E. Howard #0317 of the Cambridge Police Department administered the Alcohol Concentration Test at 0304 hours, where a sample was obtained.  ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION TEST RESULT: .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath  Notation: Roe was remorseful, polite and cooperative throughout the entire encounter.
