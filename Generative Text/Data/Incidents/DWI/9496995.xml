         <NarrativeText> DUI#: S-23-027 MD Soundex: S-200-465-560-579 DIGITAL EVIDENCE FROM MOBILE VIDEO RECORDER (MVR): Maryland State Police vehicle, S-19 is equipped with video recording equipment. Body worn recording device also worn. Event recorded. OFFICER EXPERIENCE:  I am certified through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in DWI detection and administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs). I have also have completed the Maryland State Police Academy.  PHASE ONE- VEHICLE IN MOTION:  On March 18, 2023, I, TFC Emerson #7196, was traveling on W/B RT 20. While traveling I observed a Red Dodge ram displaying DE registration, C86179, Traveling in front of me. I observed the vehicle drifting inside of its lane which is a NHTSA certified sign of impairment. I then observed the vehicle cross both the shoulder line and the center line. Based on observations I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle came to a stop on the shoulder of RT 20 at RT 21. I know through my training, knowledge, and experience, drivers under the influence of alcohol or other substances often struggle with maintaining lane integrity.  PHASE TWO-PERSONAL CONTACT:  I made contact with the driver and identified him as Kentrall Luther Sisco, B/M/07/23/1992. I explained to the Sisco the reasoning for the stop. I observed Sisco had glassy and bloodshot eyes and also detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his persons. I observed Sisco was wearing St. Paddys day jewelry as well. Sisco advised he was coming back from a bar in Delaware and he was having a ba night after he got into an argument with his girlfriend. Sisco did advised he had some drinks. I know from my training, Knowledge, and experience and through my NHTSA training in DWI detection, these are all signs of impairment.  PHASE THREE- PRE-ARREST SCREENING (SFSTs):   Based on my observations, I asked Sisco to perform voluntary Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs). Sisco complied with my request and advised he would take the tests.   I asked Sisco to place his feet together and place his hands down by his sides. I asked Sisco if he took any prescription medications, or if he wore corrective lenses and he advised no.  I asked Sisco if he had any medical conditions that would prevent him from driving, walking in a straight line, or standing on one leg and he advised no.   The SFSTs were performed on the side of RT 20. The surface was wet. The surface was flat, hard, level, and was free of debris and obstructions. The weather was cloudy and misting with temperatures in the mid 40s with mild winds. The SFSTs were performed with the following results: HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) - Involuntary jerking of the eyes occurring as the eyes gaze to the side. Total Clues observed: (6/6)  Sisco was advised to stand with his feet together, his arms down by his side and to look straight ahead. Sisco was instructed to hold his head still during the test and to follow the stimulus with his eyes only. Sisco was then asked if he understood the instructions and he acknowledge by saying yes.  Placing my stimulus approximately 12-15 inches away from Sisco, I checked his eyes for equal pupil size, equal tracking and any signs of resting nystagmus. This is done to check for any kind of medical disorder or injury that might exhibit a form of nystagmus. I observed none of these signs or symptoms when checking Siscos eyes. - Siscos eyes displayed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. - Siscos eyes displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. - Siscos eyes displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to forty-five degrees in both eyes. WALK AND TURN (WAT) - A divided attention field sobriety test consisting of two stages. -Sisco was not able to maintain the starting postion.  -Sisco stopped the test after taking 9 steps and asked for instruction on what to do afterwards. -Sisco completed the turn around unsatisfactory by shuffling both feet -Sisco did not touch heel to toe step 2 and 4 of first series of 9 steps. -Sisco raised his hands above 6 inches multiple times during the test. ONE LEG STAND (OLS) - A divided attention field sobriety test consisting of two stages. -Sisco completed the test to satisfaction. I asked Sisco after all my field sobriety tests were over that if he were to rate him self from 1 being stone cold sober and 10 being completely drunk where would he be? Sisco responded that he was at a 5. ARREST DECISIONS (Probable Cause):  Based on my observations, I determined Sisco was unable to operate a vehicle safely. This is based on the totality of the circumstances from my initial examination of the scene, the personal contact with the driver, and the clues from the psychophysical testing. All the evidence taken, together, established probable cause for me to believe Sisco was driving while impaired and I placed Sisco under arrest.  TRANSPORT:  While in my vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Sisco. Sisco was polite and cooperative during transport. Sisco became very talkative while inside my vehicle.  Sisco was read his DR-15, Advice of Rights. The DR-15 was read using the English audio version. The form was read in its entirety. I asked Sisco if he wanted to take the intoximeter test at which time he refused due to him not wanting to take the test and not wanting to go to North East, MD to take the intoximeter test at approximately 0042 hours.  Sisco was issued the appropriate Maryland Uniformed Citations and was provided signed copies of the DR-15 and DR-15A forms.
