         <NarrativeText>Marked Car L-13: Dashcam available.  Body Worn Camera: Body-worn camera available.  Assisting Troopers/Officers: Trooper Lebga - Body-worn camera available.   Defendant:                                     Phuc Dinh Truong  Date of Birth:                                    12/31/1969  Date of Arrest:                                   01/19/2023  Times of Arrest:                                  2331 hours  DUI #: 23-MSP-002352                        (Forestville Barrack, 23-023)  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING   * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 01/19/2023 at approximately 2312 hours I, Corporal Oleyar, was on routine patrol in my marked MSP vehicle L-13, when I was traveling on the I/L 495 north of Rt. 4 in Prince Georges County, Maryland. I was traveling southbound when I observed a white Jeep Grand Cherokee bearing Virginia registration TTU3713 approaching me rapidly from behind. That vehicle then swerved into lane two to pass me, and as it did slowed to a speed that I paced at 80mph. During that time the vehicle began to straddle the broken white lane dividing line separating lanes two and three. I then activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on that vehicle. I then made contact with the driver.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I made contact with the driver via the passenger side window. I introduced myself, explained the reason for the stop, and requested the drivers license and registration. The driver provided me with his license with relative ease, but had to be reminded to get his registration as well. The driver, now identified by his Virginia drivers license to be Phuc Dinh Truong (DOB 12/31/1969), attempted to hand me a sheet of paper that was not his registration. After I explained there, he then had to check his paperwork a second time before providing me with the vehicles registration. While speaking with me, I noted that Truongs eyes were bloodshot and watery and his speech was slurred. I also noted that Truongs movements were slow and lethargic. I also smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I then asked Truong how much he had to drink, to which he stated that he had consumed three beers and some wine. I then asked Truong where he was coming from and to where he was going. Truong stated that he had just left a party celebrating Vietnamese new year and was on his way to meet a friend at the MGM casino. At this time I asked Truong to exit the vehicle. As I continued to speak with Truong in front of his vehicle, I now smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I informed Truong that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he consented.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)    The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of I-495 north of RT 4 (asphalt). The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and the temperature was approximately 45 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicles headlamps and my flashlight. Truong appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.   Injuries  None.  Glasses  Only reading glasses.  Medical Conditions  None.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)    The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pointer finger was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Truongs eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Truongs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. He was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Truong if he understood the instructions and he stated yes.     1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes   2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes   3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes   VGN - Not present.     WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed)    Prior to Truong performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Truong was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Truong was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Truong was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Truong was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Truong was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Truong was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Truong was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Truong if he understood the test and he stated, Yes.    Instructional Stage:  1.) Could not maintain balance.    Walking Stage (1st Nine):  1.) Missed heel to toe on more than three occasions.  2.) Stepped off line on more than three occasions.  3.) Took 13 steps.  4.) Raised arms to maintain balance during the turn.  5.) Stopped walking.    Walking Stage (2nd Nine):   1.) Missed heel to toe on more than three occasions.  2.) Stepped off line on more than three occasions.  3.) Took 10 steps.  4.) Raised arms to maintain balance during the turn.   Turn:   1.) Performed incorrectly - lifted both feet    ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed)    Prior to Truong performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Truong was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Truong if he understood the test and he indicated that he did.    Truong chose to balance on his right foot, but switched to his left foot approximately half way through the test.    Instructional Stage:   1.) No clues observed.    Balance and Count Stage:    Seconds 0-10:  1.)  Put foot down.   Seconds 11-20:  1.)  Put foot down.    Seconds 21-30:  1.)  Put foot down.  2.)  Sways.    Truong agreed to submit to the PBT which yielded a 0.151 BrAC result.    ARREST    Based on the following, I had reason to believe Truong was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  * Observed driving.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  * Eyes bloodshot and watery.  * Admission to consuming three beers and some wine..  * Difficulty locating requested information and needing to be reminded to provide me with his registration.  * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.  * Slurred speech.  * PBT result of 0.151 BrAC.  * Apologized for driving in his condition, admitting that he was impaired.   I arrested Truong for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2331 hours and he was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Forestville Barrack for processing. Upon returning to the Forestville barrack, I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Truong in English. Truong agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same at approximately 0002 hours.   During arrest, while en route to the barrack, and while at the barrack, Truong made numerous excited utterances. Truong stated that he knew he was in the wrong, that he shouldnt have been driving, and apologized numerous times.  INTOXIMETER RESULT:   *** 0.169 BrAC ***   Truong was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released from to the custody of a sober individual. Truong was polite and cooperative for the entirety of our interaction.   All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.   Case closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
