Beans initial stop to perform field sobriety. The vehicle was already identified as a Black Hyundai Tucson bearing MD registration 9EC1363 and the driver identified as Gary Anthony Anderson (03/28/1975 1/M). Cpl Bean relayed to me that the vehicle was traveling on Beaglin Park Drive with the headlights not activated when required and no lights on on the rear of the vehicle. HE also informed me that the vehicle came to a stop at the red light on Beaglin Park at Still Meadows, and after stopping completely, it slowly drove into the intersection with the light still being red. I later reviewed his front facing camera and confirmed the lights not being on as well as the vehicle slowly driving into the intersection with the light still being red. It almost reached the other side of the intersection before the light turned green and it accelerated. Anderson also made statements to Cpl. Bean about coming back from a bachelor party which I was also able to confirm by later reviewing his body camera footage. After this information was relayed to me I then took over the traffic stop and contacted Anderson who was still sitting in the driver seat of the vehicle.    PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  As I came to the window and again explained why he was stopped, the extremely strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was immediately present coming from the inside of the vehicle. I could also observe Andersons eyes to be bloodshot and glassy and his eyelids to be droopy. I asked him how much he had to drink and he stated he, aint had much to drink. I asked him to step out of the vehicle to conduct field sobriety and he initially said no and that I had no reason to do that in a slurred and almost incoherent speech. I explained to him the situation and what would happen if he refuses and he then stepped out of the vehicle. As he was stepping out, he placed his wallet on top of the car and walked to the rear of his vehicle. All of his movements were slow and exaggerated. I placed Anderson in between my vehicle and his and began to perform Standardized Field Sobriety.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  I began by asking Anderson the standardized medical questions. I first asked if he wears glasses or contacts to which he responded with no but that he might need them. I asked Anderson if he took any medication to which he responded with blood pressure medication of Lisapril. I asked if he had any injuries to which he responded with his legs after an accident in November and was looking at his right knee when he said it. I then asked if he could walk okay and if he was okay now and he said yes. Also, I could now clearly detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath when he spoke after we had stepped away from the vehicle. I could also continue to see that his movements were slow and lethargic, he was swaying side to side, and his speech was slurred and almost incoherent.   I explained the first test to Anderson which was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: Could Not Perform  As I was explaining the test to Anderson he became increasingly argumentative and aggressive with me. I explained to him several times why I was performing the test and that I could smell alcohol and he became increasingly agitated and argumentative. I tried several times to perform the test but Anderson proved to be incapable of following directions. He did not keep his head still during any portion of the test, and he continued to put his hands behind his back. Every time I would correct him he would argue with me and become increasingly agitated. Based on his demeanor and him being unable to follow any instructions given, I decided to move on to the next test.    ARREST:  I then attempted to explain the next test to Anderson which is the Walk and Turn Test. As I explained the next test to Anderson he again asked me why I was doing the test. At this point I recognized that Anderson was speaking in circles and asking the same question over and over again. I again tried to explain the test and after the first instruction given he became argumentative and raising his voice. Based on his continued argumentative demeanor and his unwillingness and incapability to follow simple instruction, I determined Anderson could not complete field sobriety and placed him under arrest for DUI / DWI at approximately 0335 hours.   Anderson initially began to pull away from me and tense up but was successfully placed in handcuffs without incident or injury. I could also could clearly detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person. I placed Anderson in my vehicle, and after securing his belongings from the vehicle he was driving, I re entered my vehicle and the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage had filled my vehicle that had not been present before placing him inside. I transported Anderson to the Salisbury State Police Barrack for processing.   I placed Anderson in the DUI room at the barrack and verbally read him his Dr-15 Advice of rights while also providing him with a physical copy to follow along with. Anderson remained argumentative and was again speaking in circles and asking the same questions over and over again. Also, in the light of the barrack, his eyes were now more clearly bloodshot and glassy and his eyelids were droopy. At approximately 0407 hours, Anderson refused the Intoximeter test. I later had him sign paperwork and he acted confused and asked me when he refused to take the Intoximeter test. Also, as I opened the window on the cell door, the extremely strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was present that was not present before placing Anderson inside. He was later released to a sober driver.   I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live donors at the Maryland State Police Academy. I have also completed an additional 16 hours of Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training through the Maryland State Police. My training, knowledge, and experience have led to several prior DUI arrests and subsequent convictions.  CASE CLOSED  TFC Todd 6929 </NarrativeText>
