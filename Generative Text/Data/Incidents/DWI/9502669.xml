         <NarrativeText>DUI Arrest  Case #: 23MSP010601  Defendant: John Phillip Lugo  DOB: 05/13/2002  Date of Arrest: 03/24/2023  Time of Arrest: 1922 hours  MD License: L200429683364  DUI #: 23-072  Training/Certificates      I am trained and certified in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      Trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.     Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1)  On 03/24/2023 at approximately 1821 hours, I, Trooper Stallings #7589 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, was dispatched to a three vehicle collision on westbound Route 50 at Landover Rd in Landover Hills, Prince Georges County, Maryland. Upon my arrival on scene, I observed a black Toyota Corolla bearing D.C. registration (JB7134) on the right shoulder of westbound Route 50 with heavy damage to the back driver side tire. Approximately 300 feet up on the right shoulder, I observed a red Acura sedan bearing Maryland registration (1DY4493) partially blocking lane 2. This Acura sustained heavy front-end damage. I also observed a gray honda civic bearing D.C. registration (GI9677) on the left shoulder of westbound route 50 with disabling damage to the rear-end and back driver side tire. The driver of the gray honda civic requested medic assistance and complained of a potential back injury sustained from the collision. The driver was transported to Howard hospital. All vehicles were towed from the scene.  Personal Contact (Phase 2)  I made contact with the driver of the red Acura who was standing outside of his vehicle on the right shoulder of westbound Route 50. The driver was identified as John Phillip Lugo (DOB 05/12/2002) by his Maryland drivers license. John advised me that he was not injured and didnt need any medical assistance. I asked John what happened. He stated that he swerved into the right lane to avoid striking a vehicle that was coming to a stop and struck the black Toyota Corolla on its driver side. John then said that the Toyota went on to strike the gray Honda Civic. John stated that he was coming from work and was headed home. While speaking with John I noticed bloodshot glassy eyes, slurred speech, and a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and or person. I then explained to John that I wanted him to complete Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST), which he agreed to.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3)  The tests were administered on the right shoulder of westbound Route 50 at Landover Rd.The surface was slightly wet, level, and free of any debris. John appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injury. My vehicles front facing emergency lights were deactivated during all the tests.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. It was held approximately 12-15 inches from Johns eyes, slightly above his eye level. John was instructed to follow the tip of the stimulus with his eyes without moving his head. Johns eyes were equal in size and showed equal tracking.      Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes      Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes     Vertical nystagmus was not observed.  Walk and Turn (4/8 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. John was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe in a straight line. John was then instructed to place his hands down by his sides and remain in that position until told to begin. John was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. On the ninth step, he was instructed to keep his lead foot planted, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. After the turn, John was instructed to complete the second series of nine (9) steps in the same heel to toe fashion. John was instructed to keep his hands down by his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, count every step aloud, and once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed. I asked John if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  John completed the test wearing tennis shoes.  Instructional Stage      John failed to maintain the instructed position by separating his feet     Walking Stage (1st Nine)      John stepped off line on steps 4 and 9     Turn  John forgot he had to turn and had to be reminded, once he did the turn he did it improperly by turning in the wrong direction.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine)      John missed heel to toe on steps 3 and 5      John stepped off line on step 8      ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated. John was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch the raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, etc) and to not put his foot down until the end of the test. I asked John if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:      John dropped his foot 2 times     Seconds 11-20:      John dropped his foot     Seconds 21-30:      John dropped his foot 2 times     During the one leg stand test, John stopped balancing on one leg and asked to switch legs but then continued to balance on the same leg. John restarted his count 3 different times throughout the test.  PBT  John was offered a Preliminary Breathalyzer Test (PBT) on scene, which he agreed to take. The result was .17 BrAC.  Arrest  Based on the above listed clues, observations, and detections from John, he was arrested at 1922 hours for driving while under the influence of alcohol. John was then transported to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack for processing. Upon arrival at the barrack, John was provided with a copy of the DR-15 advice of rights and was played an english audio recording of the rights via the MVA website. At 2003 hours, John refused to submit to the intoximeter test. A secondary search was conducted at the barrack, and no contraband was located during the search.  Release:  John was released to a sober driver from the barrack.  All events occurred in Prince Georges and Montgomery County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
