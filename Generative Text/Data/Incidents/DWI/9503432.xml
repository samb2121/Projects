         <NarrativeText>DUI CASE # 23-96-017 SUSPECT: Abner Ismael Gomez Mendaz LICENSE # MD-10273531310 DUI CITATION #1NL0URX SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER: -No- ACCIDENT INVOLVED: -NO- VIDEO: MARYLAND STATE POLICE UNIT V-10 IS EQUIPPED WITH VIDEO RECORDING EQUIPMENT CAMERA WAS OPERATIONAL BODY CAMERA WAS OPERATIONAL AS WELL NARRATIVE  Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:  On Thursday, January 26th 2023 at approximately 1807hrs. I (TFC. Davis #7043) responded to the area of MD Rt. 90 and US Rt. 50 for the report of a vehicle in a ditch. Upon my arrival I located a blue Chevy Silverado MD Reg: 1FG3686 to be partially submerged in the ditch off the side of the road. The driver of the vehicle who was identified as Abner Gomez Mendez (DOB: 03/28/1993) by his Guatemala ID card was still attempting to get his vehicle out of the ditch but with no success. Phase #2 - Personal Contact Mendez exited his vehicle upon my arrival and I observed a Coors Lite pint bottle fall out of the drivers side vehicle. Mendez approached me and tried to explain what happened in broken English. Mendez stated that he was parked on the side of the road and that his truck had slipped down the slope. Based on my observation Mendez had driven approximately half a mile in the ditch before becoming stuck. I questioned Mendez on how much he had to drink, and he stated nothing. I pointed out the empty can that had fallen out and then Mendez stated in Spanish that he spoke very little English. While speaking with Mendez I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. Additionally, I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening  I had PFC. Pantich #8371 from the Ocean City Police Department responded to the scene to assist me with translation for Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. Prior to his arrival I attempted to complete HGN. Mendez would not keep his head still, despite that I was still able to observe lack of smooth pursuit. PFC. Pantich advised that Mendez was voluntarily agreeing to take the tests and that he understood all of the translations. Mendez did later admit to having two (2) beers prior to driving after leaving work in Ocean City. Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus  Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes  Equal Pupil Size: Yes  Lack of smooth pursuit present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation present in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees present in both eyes  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was additionally observed.  Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues6 of 6  Walk and Turn  Weather: Clear Surface: Flat gravel surface free of any debris Mendez immediately began the test upon PFC. Pantich beginning his translation. This happened numerous times during the instructions. Ultimately Mendez left the starting position and had to be put back in it numerous times.  1st Nine Steps Mendez stepped off-line on step 8 Mendez stopped walking on step 17  Mendez ended up taking approximately 27 steps Turn Mendez did not complete the turn properly 2nd Nine Steps Mendez took 26 steps back Total clues 6 out of 8  One Leg Stand   Weather: Same as Above Surface: Same as Above  Seconds 0-10 Mendez used his arms for balance Mendez put his foot down  Mendez swayed in all directions. Seconds 11-20   Total One Leg Stand Clues 3 of 4 Arrest and Transport  Mendez was verbally advised and placed under arrest for driving under the influence at 1856 hrs. and was secured in my patrol vehicle. At this time Mendez had played for him his DR-15 (advice of rights) Spanish version verbatim from the MVA website. And at 1916 hrs. he agreed to submit to the Intox test. While on the way to the barrack I was still able to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Mendezs breath and person. The Intoximeter test was administer by Cpl. Jonischek #4794 Which yielded insufficient results due to Mendez not blowing hard enough. Attempts were even made using the language line to explain everything to Mendez who stated that he understood however did not complete the test the correct way. Due to Mendez not having a ride and living in Baltimore he was taken before a district court commissioner. Commissioner Barbely found no PC for the arrest and Mendez was given a ride into Ocean City where he was released without any further incident.   Mendez was charged with the following  1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol 21-902(a1i) 2) Driving While Impaired by Alcohol 21-902(b1i) 3) Driving Veh. While so far Impaired by Alcohol Cannot Drive Safety21-902(c1i)  4) Negligent Driving 21-901.1(b) 5) Reckless Driving 21-901.1(a) 6) Driving without a license 16-101(a1) 7) Failure to Drive on Right Half of Roadway When Required 21-301(a)  All events did occur in Worcester County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
