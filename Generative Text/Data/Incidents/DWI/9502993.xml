         <NarrativeText>Physical Evidence: The physical evidence in this case was the rolling paper containing suspected cannabis recovered from the suspects pants pocket. The total weight of .82 grams was verified by Sgt. Landis #5082.The CDS was recognized as marijuana by my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. The suspected cannabis was seized and processed according to agency policy and regulations. The cannabis was stored on MSP Form 67 Chain of Custody under the Property Held P-339117  This incident was audibly and visually recorded. Unmarked Unit L-17 equipped with MVR and BWC.  On January 29th, 2023, at approximately 0212 hours, I, Trooper Skutovas #7332, was operating unmarked Unit L-17 when I was dispatched to a single vehicle property damage crash at the ramp from National Harbor Blvd to I-495.  Upon my arrival I saw a white Mazda CX-5 with heavy front end damage. I made contact with the driver who I later identified by his DC license as Demonte Antonio Cooper (DOB: 01/22/1998, B/M). I noticed the strong smell of an alcoholic beverage on Coopers breath, Coopers slurred speech, and Coopers glassy eyes while discussing the details of the accident and Cooper admitted to having consumed alcohol prior to driving. I asked Cooper if he would be willing to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and Cooper consented to the tests.  The evaluation was conducted on the roadway prior to the accident with emergency vehicles blocking the roadway from traffic. The surface was level and dry. Cooper appeared to be in good physical condition and did not seem to be injured from the collision.  SFST Test Results:  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN):Clues observed 4/6  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Coopers eyes. Cooper was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Coopers pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Cooper had to be reminded to remain focused on the stimulus because he would gaze off into the background behind the stimulus.  - Lack of Smooth Pursuit in Both Eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation in Both Eyes  Walk and Turn Test: 3/8 clues observed  Prior to Cooper performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Cooper was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary line. Cooper was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Cooper was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. Cooper was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Cooper was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Cooper was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Cooper was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Cooper if he understood the test, and he advised he understood but advised that one of the his toes was broken.  - Misses Heel to Toe - Raises Arms for Balance on Second Set of Steps - Improper Turn  One Leg Standing Test: Clues observed 2/4  Prior to Cooper performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Cooper was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Cooper was asked if he understood the test and the instructions. He advised that he understood.  - Raises Arms for Balance in the 10-20 second range of performing the test. - Puts Foot Down in the 10-20 second range of performing the test.  Cooper was offered to take a Preliminary Breath Test after taking the prior 3 tests and Cooper declined. I then placed my handcuffs on Cooper and informed Cooper that he was under arrest at approximately 0250 hours. I then searched Cooper and the front passenger side area of my vehicle prior to transporting Cooper. Cooper was then transported to the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack for processing.  Cooper and I arrived at the barrack at approximately 0310 hours and Cooper was searched again. During this search I found a personal use amount of cannabis (.82 grams) in a rolling paper which I then processed using a Chain of Custody and Property Held Record P-339117.  Cooper was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights at approximately 0317 hours. Cooper was offered the Intoximeter test but refused. Cooper chose to sign the DR-15A form issued to him and his license was not confiscated because it was an out-of-state license. Cooper was later released to a sober driver shortly after the completion of his processing.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
