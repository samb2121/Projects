         <NarrativeText>Traffic stop. In-Car Camera Operational, H-26. This incident was recorded on TFC Thomas Body-Worn Camera.  Driver: Ayerica Nicole Powell, AA/F, DOB: 03/11/1983  Maryland SDX:  P-400-078-630-187   Address:  4793 Kittiwake Ct., Waldorf, MD 20603  Vehicle: MD 6CD8544 - 2020 Nissan Altima  Location: S/B Route 301, N/O Acton Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland  Training and Certificates:   Trained and certified in administering the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Safety Administration.   Completed LIDAR and RADAR training through the Maryland State Police.  Completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E) training in June 2019.   Completed Crisis Intervention Training in September 2020.  Distinguished Graduate of the Maryland Highway Safety Office and University of Maryland DUI Institute in July 2022.  Recipient of the Maryland Highway Safety Office DUI Award for Consecutive Years (2020 and 2021).   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Completed Cannabis Impairment Detection Course in May 2023  NARRATIVE:  PHASE 1  VEHICLE IN MOTION  On 09/01/2023, at approximately 0030 hours, I, TFC Thomas #7065 of the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack was on routine patrol in unmarked vehicle H-26 in the area of southbound Route 301, north of Acton Lane when I observed a gray Nissan Altima bearing MD Registration 6CD8544 traveling over the divided line of lane #2 and lane #3. I further observed the Nissans driver-side front and rear tires travel over the divided line into lane #1. The Nissans passenger-side front and rear tires traveled over the divided line into lane #3 on three separate occasions. I positioned my vehicle behind the Nissan, activated my emergency equipment and conducted a lawful traffic stop.   PHASE 2  PERSONAL CONTACT  I made contact with the driver and asked her for her drivers license and vehicle registration. The driver responded, Why you got to be so loud? I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the drivers breath. I further observed the driver with red and glassy eyes. I then asked the driver if she consumed any alcoholic beverages and the driver responded by saying, No. I advised her again that I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath. The driver was identified by her Maryland Drivers License as Ayerica Nicole Powell, AA/F, DOB: 03/11/1983.  PHASE 3  PRE-ARREST SCREENING  I asked Powell again is she consumed alcoholic beverages tonight and she responded by saying, I had drinks at Happy Hour. I asked Powell if she suffered from High Blood Pressure and she responded by saying, No. I further asked Powell if she ever had any head trauma, brain tumors or concussions and she responded by saying, No. I asked Powell if she took any medications prescribed by a medical doctor and she responded by saying, I took Tylenol for my Menstrual. I asked Powell if she suffered from any medical issues that would prevent her from completing the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and she responded by saying, No.   The three tests administered to Powell were the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus, Walk and Turn and the One-Leg Stand tests. Powell conducted the tests in comfortable shoes and clothing. All tests were performed on a level surface, free of debris and in a well-lit area.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)   The first test conducted was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held 12-15 inches fromPowells eyes. Powell was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping herhead still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with hereyes until told to stop. Powells pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.Powell advised she understood the instructions. I observed Powell moving her head from side to side and I had to repeat the instruction for her to watch the pen with her eyes only.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in Both Eyes.  2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in Both Eyes.  3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in Both Eyes.  Vertical Nystagmus  Not Present.  WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed)  Prior to Powell performing the test, Iproperly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Powell was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel-to-toe. Powell was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in that position until told to begin. Powell was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching heel-to-toe on every step. Powell was instructed to keep her hands flat at her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, it was explained and demonstrated to Powell to keep her left foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps with her right foot to turn completely around. Again, it was explained and demonstrated to Powell during the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Powell was instructed that once she began the test, she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her side, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. Powell advised she understood the instructions. Powell could not maintain her balance in the standby position.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Could Not Maintain her Balance.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel-to-toe on steps 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10. 2.) Raised arms more than 6 inches from her side to maintain balance. 3.) Stepped-off line between steps 8 and 9. 4.) Incorrect number of steps. Powell took 17 steps.  Improper turn: Powell did not complete a series of small steps as directed per the instructions.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Missed heel-to-toe on steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15 and 17. 2.) Raised arms more than 6 inches from her side to maintain balance. 3.) Stepped-off line between steps 4/5 and 9/10. 4.) Powell stopped walking during test. 5.) Incorrect number of steps. Powell took 17 steps.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) Prior to Powell performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Powell was instructed to stand with her heels together and her hands down by her sides while the instructions were given, and during the test. When instructed to start, Powell was instructed to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised, Powell was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot, to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop.Powell advised she understood the instructions.  Instructional Stage: No Observations Noted.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: 1.) Swayed more than 3 inches from her left to her right. 2.) Used her Arms for Balance. 3.) Put foot on ground on count 7.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 11-20: 1.) Swayed more than 3 inches from her left to her right. 2.) Used her Arms for Balance. 3.) Did not raise her foot off the ground.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 21-30: 1.) Swayed more than 3 inches from her left to her right. 2.) Used her Arms for Balance. 3.) Put foot on ground on count 22 and 25.   I offered Powell a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT), to which she refused. Based on my training, knowledge and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and in making DUI and DWI arrests, her glassy red eyes, failure to maintain her balance while standing, odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and her failure to maintain her lane while operating a motor vehicle, I believed Powell was too impaired to operate a motor vehicle. I placed Powell under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at 0105 hours.   Powell was transported to the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack for processing.   While in the Barrack, Powell was advised of her DR-15, Advice of Rights on 09/01/2023 at 0123 hours. Powell was explained the form, and asked if she had any questions. Powell responded by saying, No. At 0134 hours, Powell signed the DR-15, Advise of Rights Form and refused to submit to an Intoximeter test. Powell was extremely talkative and her mood continuously reverted from agitated to playful throughout the entire interaction.   Powell was processed for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and Driving While Impaired by Alcohol. Powell was released to a sober driver at the Barrack.  Charges:    TA 21-902(a1i)  Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol  TA 21-902(b1i)  Driving While Impaired by Alcohol  TA 21-901.1(b)  Negligent Driving  TA 21-901.1(a)  Reckless Driving   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;TA 21-201(a1)  Failure to Obey Properly Placed Traffic Control Device Instr.  All events occurred in Charles County, MD.  Case Closed. </NarrativeText>
