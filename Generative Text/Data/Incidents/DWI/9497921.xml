         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM*  The following incident was captured on in-car camera and body worn camera. Title: DUI 23-020 R. ID: 23-MSP-000890.  Case #: 23-MSP-000890 DUI #: 23-020 (Golden Ring Barrack) Defendant: Chawmer Cherese Phillips  TRAINING: *I am trained by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. *I am approved by the State of Maryland Office of Chief Medical Examiner and Maryland State Police to conduct preliminary breath tests. *I have successfully completed the Instructor Development Course in Standardized Field Sobriety Testing by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *I have successfully completed and graduated with distinction from the 15th session of the University of Marylands Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies (DUI Institute.) *I have successfully completed the Instructor Development Course in Preliminary Breath Tests by the Maryland State Police. *I have successfully completed the Basic Breath Test Operator Course. *I attended the Impaired Driving Conference, October 2018. *I have successfully completed a 24-hour NHTSA course in Moving/Stationary Doppler RADAR and LIDAR through the Baltimore County Police Department, June 2019. *I have apprehended more than 425 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE ONE):  On January 8, 2023, at approximately 0225 hours, I, Trooper First Class Jackson #6481, was on routine patrol in Maryland State Police unmarked unit DUI-6. While patrolling Golden Ring Road at I-695, I observed a silver Honda Accord (MD: 7ES8202) swerve to the left, over the double yellow lane lines and into the on-coming traffic lane by half the vehicles width. I caught up with the operator while they were stopped in the right yield lane to westbound Pulaski Highway. The operator remained stopped in the yield lane for over 10 seconds with no traffic in sight on westbound Pulaski Highway.  The operator made a wide right turn causing the vehicle to travel momentarily between the merge lane and lane #2 (right lane.) The operator came to a complete stop in the merge lane. Based on these observations, I felt the Honda was being operated in an unsafe manner and needed to be stopped. I activated my emergency lights behind the stopped Honda on Westbound Pulaski Highway at I-695 in Baltimore County, Maryland.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE TWO):  I contacted the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle at the passenger window. I identified myself and the reasons for the traffic stop. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within the vehicle. I observed the drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. She was moving slow and appeared disoriented. I observed her speech was slurred. I identified the driver by her Maryland drivers license as Chawmer Cherese Phillips 1/F 12/22/86. I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within the vehicle.  I returned to my patrol vehicle where I conducted a license check on Phillips. I deactivated my front emergency lights and made my second approach on the drivers side. I asked Phillips to exit her vehicle in order to separate her from the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within. I observed Phillips climb out of her vehicle. I instructed Phillips to walk to the front of her vehicle. I observed her walk in a staggered and unbalanced manner.  While outside the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Phillips breath and person. Phillips admitted to consuming one mixed drink at her Nieces house prior to driving. Phillips asked to call someone to pick her up or if she could call and UBER to pick her up. Throughout my interaction with Phillips, I observed her speech was slurred and I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. I asked Phillips to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and she agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE THREE):  I conducted the evaluation on the right side of westbound Pulaski Highway at Golden Ring Road. My patrol flashlight lit the area. The area appeared to be level, dry, and free of any obvious debris. Phillips appeared to be overweight.  I asked Phillips the following questions:  Glasses or contact: No. Medications: No. Physical or mental injuries: No. Medical conditions: No.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): 6/6 CLUES OBSERVED.  I instructed Phillips to stand with her heels and toes together and her arms flat down at her sides. I then properly explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Phillips and she stated she understood. I positioned Phillips in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test. Phillips pupils were equal in size, resting nystagmus was not present, and her eyes showed equal tracking.  1.) Lack of smooth pursuit- Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes. 4.) Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Present in both eyes.  NOTE: During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Phillips breath. I had to reinstruct the test to Phillips multiple times. I observed Phillips swaying in a circular motion throughout the test.  WALK AND TURN (WAT): 5/8 CLUES OBSERVED.  I instructed Phillips to stand in the instructional position, with her right foot in front of her left foot, touching heel to toe, in a straight line, with her hands flat down at her sides. I instructed Phillips to remain in that position until I tell her to begin the test and she stated she understood. I demonstrated and explained the Walk and Turn to Phillips in accordance with the NHTSA manual.  Instructional Phase: During the instructional phase, Phillips lost her balance several times causing her to break her heel to toe stance and step off line. Prior to the test, I allowed Phillips to retrieve another jacket from her vehicle. I demonstrated and explained the test to Phillips for a second time where she again failed to maintain her balance during the instructions. Phillips stated that she understood the test.  Walking Stage (1st nine): 1.) Phillips missed touching heel to toe by three to six inches on steps 1 through 10. 2.) Phillips stepped off line on step 1. 3.) Phillips took 10 steps.  Turn: Phillips stopped halfway through the turn before I instructed her to turn completely around.  Walking Stage (2nd nine): 1.) Phillips missed touching heel to toe by three to six inches on steps 1 through 10. 2.) Phillips stepped off line on steps 2, 9 and 10. 3.) Phillips took 10 steps.  ONE LEG STAND (OLS): 1/4 CLUES OBSERVED.  I instructed Phillips to stand with her heels and toes together and her arms flat down at her sides. I then demonstrated and explained the One Leg Stand to Phillips in accordance with the NHTSA manual. Phillips stated that she understood. Phillips attempted to raise her left foot.  Instructional Stage: During the instructional stage, I observed Phillips stumble forward while attempting to start the test too soon.  Balance and Count Stage:  1.) Phillips put her foot down six times. In the thirty seconds the test was timed, Phillips raised her foot off the ground for a total of six seconds.  Preliminary Breath Test (PBT):  I offered Phillips a Preliminary Breath Test, which she agreed. Result: 0.19 BrAC. NOTE: During the PBT, Phillips urinated on herself. Phillips admitted to consuming one and half rum mixed drinks prior to driving.  ARREST:  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Phillips was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0244 hours, I placed Phillips under arrest for driving while under the influence. Search incident to arrest revealed no contraband on Phillips person. I placed Phillips in the front passenger seat per department policy. I transported Phillips to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing.  Once at the Barrack, I placed Phillips in the holding cell where she was given an opportunity to urinate and clean herself up. At that time, I inspected and cleaned my patrol vehicle from any possible contamination from Phillips urine.  I retrieved Phillips from the holding cell and conducted a check of her mouth at 0335 hours. I provided Phillips with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. I then played the DR-15 Advice of Rights audio aloud and instructed Phillips to follow along. At approximately 0409 hours, Phillips agreed to submit to an alcohol concentration test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:  I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Phillips beginning at 0335 hours. I conducted a search of Phillips mouth and the search revealed that she had nothing in her mouth. I observed Phillips from 0335 hours until the time she submitted to the test and she did not put anything in her mouth. Phillips did not have any facial or oral piercings. TFC Riba-Tankari, Operator #0091, conducted the test on a certified instrument. Phillips had a result of 0.19 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0421 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT:  ****0.19 grams of alcohol****  I issued Phillips citations, copies of the DR-15, DR-15A, and MSP 33. Phillips was cooperative throughout the incident and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
