         <NarrativeText>DUI Ref:   23-177   Incident recorded on R-21s in-car camera and multiple worn Axon cameras.   Defendant: BARNES, Kizzy Jean  Date of birth: 10/22/1977   Date of Arrest: 03/31/2023  Time of Arrest: 0147 hours  MD License: B-652-469-385-815 (valid)  Prior DUI #: 0   VICTIMS  State of Maryland   TRAINING/CERTIFICATIONS      Graduate of Maryland State Police Academy, Class 155      Trained in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police         Sykesville, Maryland, October 2022           Refresher training in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police         Pikesville, Maryland, March 2023           VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On the morning of 03/31/2023 at approximately 0130 hours I, Trooper Bukoski #7570 assigned to the Golden Ring Barrack of the Maryland State Police, was involved in searching for a hit-and-run vehicle on outer loop of I-695 before exit to I-795NB. TFC Nolf was driving R-21 while I was seated in the front passenger seat. The unknown subjects vehicle was reported by an involved semi-truck driver as, slowly going down the road with 4-way hazards on. While driving the outer loop, we noticed a vehicle stopped in the gore area of 795 and outer with its 4-way hazard lights on.   TFC Nolf turned on our emergency vehicle operations equipment and pulled in behind the vehicle.   As we pulled up behind the vehicle, the vehicle was shifted into gear and merged into lane 4 at a slow rate from the gore area. The vehicle continued to travel in lane 4 at a low traveling speed, between approx 5-10 mph, for longer than a reasonable person needs to realize that a police vehicle was behind them with active lights and sirens. The car then halted in lane 4 where there was no shoulder on the right-hand side. Lane 4 at this time was an active unobstructed travel lane on 695 under nighttime lighting conditions.   I quickly approached the vehicle and, for general public and individual safety reasons, advised the subject to move out of lane 4 and pull over along the next available right-handed shoulder area. We blocked traffic in her lane as she drove in lane 4 still at 5-10 mph. Multiple cars and semi-trucks passed us in lanes 1, 2, and 3 at normal operating highway speeds estimated to be 50 mph or over. Once leaving the concrete-barrier area and the road widened into a merge, she drifted from lane 3 into lane 2 causing another vehicle to maneuver from lane 2 to lane 1 to avoid a collision. She then began to merge back over into lane 3 and eventually came to a rest on the right-hand shoulder.   At this time, I exited the patrol vehicle to make contact with the operator again.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   When I approached the vehicle, I noticed that it was a blue honda accord bearing Maryland plates 6EZ5823. I identified the driver by her Maryland ID B-652-469-385-815 as BARNES, Kizzy Jean DOB 10/22/1977 B/F.   BARNES handed me a 2022 temporary registration document initially when I asked for her registration. While answering questions, BARNES had a delayed response time. While speaking with BARNES, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the occupant area of the vehicle.   TFC Nolf was interacting with BARNES at this time and she stated that earlier in the night, she had drunk several beers but wasnt sure how long ago that was.   After running the license and registration for a wanted check, I awaited for backup to conduct a field sobriety test. Upon the arrival of Trooper Hunt, I asked BARNES if she would step out of the vehicle in order to run some tests to determine if she was safely able to operate a vehicle and she agreed. This was done due to the multiple moving violations I witnessed prior to her stopping on the shoulder.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   My evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of outer 695 prior to Liberty. The shoulder was dry, free of debris, and well-lit by streetlights, BARNES vehicles headlights, and my flashlight. No surface defects were noted and it was dry. The gutter area of 695s shoulder was sloped descending to the west and the general roadway was sloped descending to the south. When I asked if BARNES was able to maintain her balance and if she felt steady on the surface, she stated that felt she was on a hill but she was a dancer. Footwear was athletic-style.   Prior to starting the test, all noxious stimuli of front-facing lighting and emergency equipment was deactivated.   I asked the following questions:   Glasses or contacts - None   Medical conditions - Crohns Disease with maintenance medications, prior cancer, prior broken feet with surgery and magnetic therapy.   Injuries - Denied any current pain and that she was able to balance and stand as normally   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN; note - 6 of 6 clues observed)  The first test given was the HGN. I described the test prior to starting and asked if she had any questions, which she denied. I also asked if she understood and she agreed that she did. BARNES eyes were equal in size and showed equal tracking to my thumb.   Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Observed in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Observed in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Observed in both eyes   Vertical Nystagmus was present.   WALK AND TURN (WAT; note - 7 of 8 clues observed)  The WAT was demonstrated and explained to BARNES. I asked if she had any questions, which she denied. I also asked if she understood the instructions and she agreed that she did.   Instructional Stage:  BARNES was unable to keep her balance during the instructional stage.   Walking Stage, 1st 9 steps:  STEPPED OFFLINE more than  an inch on step 2.  MISSED HEEL-TOE more than  an inch on step 2.  RAISED ARM more than 6 inches on step 3.  STOPPED WALKING between steps 3 and 4.   Walking Stage, Turn:  IMPROPERLY demonstrated the turn.   Walking Stage, 2nd 9 steps:  RAISED ARM more than 6 inches on step 2.  STOPPED WALKING between steps 2 and 3.  INCORRECT number of steps, 10 total on return.   ONE LEG STAND TEST (OLS; note - 2 of 4 clues observed)  The OLS was demonstrated and explained to BARNES. I asked if she had any questions, which she denied. I also asked if she understood the instructions and she agreed that she did.   Balance-and-count Stages:   Seconds 0-10:  SWAYED at 4 seconds.  PUT FOOT DOWN at 5 seconds.   Seconds 11-20:  NA   Seconds 21-30:  NA   ARREST   Based on the totality of circumstances listed below, I had reason to believe BARNES had driven a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:       Erratic/reckless operation observed      Glassy eyes      Delayed speech      Handing over an expired registration      Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on her breath      Suspects admission to consumption of alcohol prior to driving      Poor performance on divided attention tests (HGN 6/6) WAT (7/8) OLS (2/4)      INTOXIMETER RESULTS   BARNES listened to an audio recording of the DR15 while reading a copy. She agreed to the breath test. The breath specimen from BARNES was found to contain an alcohol concentration of 0.07 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.   DISPOSITION   Subject was picked up by her friend, JAMES NORMAN LAWS Jr. (MD-102-728-770-16) from the lobby of Golden Ring Barrack. All above events occurred in Baltimore County.
