         <NarrativeText>Charles Edward Anderson  Maryland SOUNDEX: A-536-115-189-047 Breath Test Result: .Insufficient  DUI Citation # 5VX0T5Y DUI Tape #: Video tagged as 23-MSP-011697 (Axon View XL Software)  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.). * Completed and graduated from the DUI Institute. * Completed and graduated from the SFST Instructor school  NARRATIVE -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION- On April 01, 2023 at approximately 2023 hours, I (TFC. S. Shubert #6944), was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating unmarked MSP vehicle V-08. At that time, I was dispatched to a two vehicle accident on westbound US 50 at Samuel Bowen Blvd, Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland.   Once I arrived on scene, I observed a red Honda Civic resting in lane two with minor front end damage.  -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT- I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver via the passenger side door. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. I requested his drivers license and registration card. I also observed the driver to display a dazed/expression looks on his face. The driver was later identified through his Maryland drivers license as Charles Anderson. I observed Anderson chewing a large piece of gum in an attempt to cover the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I returned to my patrol vehicle and completed the information exchange. I observed Berlin EMS ask Anderson if he needed any medical attention and Anderson refused EMS treatment.   I then exited my patrol vehicle and walked up to the drivers side window and asked Anderson to walk to the front of his motor vehicle. Anderson did as I asked. I asked where Anderson was coming from and Anderson stated I am coming from the Bad Monkey. I asked if he consumed any alcoholic beverages prior to operating his motor vehicle and Anderson stated Nothing at all. Just two beers like an hour ago. I asked Anderson if he wanted to voluntary submit to Standardized Field Sobriety tests to insure he was not impaired. Anderson agreed to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety tests.   -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING- STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder area. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of headlights and flashlight. Anderson appeared to be in good physical condition. Anderson advised he was diabetic however, checked his blood sugar level about an hour and a half ago. Anderson was wearing blue jeans, a blue sports jacket and black sneakers.  **HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: 6 of 6 clues**  1. Anderson displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  2. Anderson displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. 3. Anderson displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. ^^^I advised Anderson to keep his head still while following my pen four times during the test. I observed vertical nystagmus during the test^^^  **WALK AND TURN: 4 of 8 clues** Cannot keep balance during instructed position First nine steps: -Raised arms from sides by approximately twelve to fourteen inches on step one -Messed heel-to-toe by approximately two inches on step 2 - Stopped walking after step 2  **ONE LEG STAND: 0 of 4 clues** Could not perform the test. Due to having balancing issues. Anderson stated he did not have toes.  I then asked Anderson if he could recite the English alphabet from A-Z and Anderson stated Yes. I then asked Anderson to recite the English alphabet starting at the letter H ending at the letter T. I asked Anderson if he understood my instructions and Anderson stated Yes. Anderson stated the following: H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-S-R-I dont know  After the conclusion of all Field Sobriety Tests, I offered Anderson the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). Anderson agreed to submit to the preliminary breath test, which resulted in .19 BrAC. ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Anderson was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Caused a motor vehicle collision-Driving skills impaired! * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.  *lethargic movements   I placed Anderson under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2047 hours on April 01, 2023. At this time, I visually inspected the inside of Andersons mouth for any foreign objects and none were found.  ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) Anderson was placed and secured in the right front seat of my patrol vehicle. Anderson was given his Advice of Rights via the audio version in English of the DR-15 Form. I placed a copy of the DR-15 in front of Anderson. Due to the hazardous weather I stopped the DR-15 and transported Anderson back to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for processing.   Once we arrived to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack. Anderson advised he needed to check his blood sugar levels. Berlin EMS responded to the Berlin Barrack and checked his blood sugar levels. After EMS left, I read Anderson his Advice of Rights. Once I completed reading Anderson his Advice of Rights he stated he understood and submitted to the Intoximeter test at approximately 2131 hours.   Intoximeter: Cpl. Ruiz and myself checked Andersons mouth for any foreign objects. Anderson did not have any foreign objects or liquid located in his mouth. Anderson gave four invalid breath samples, which resulted in an insufficient sample.  PROCESSING During all aspects of processing (mugshot, completion and explanation of the DR-15A Form, issuance and explanation of citations), the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Anderson continued to be strong.  CHARGES Anderson was charged with the following citations: 1. Driving Vehicle While Under The Influence Of Alcohol (5VX0T5Y) 2. Driving While Impaired By Alcohol (5VZ0T5Y) 3. Negligent driving (50VYT5Y) 4. Failure to control speed to avoid a collision (5VW0T5Y Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Worcester County, MD. </NarrativeText>
