NARRATIVE/ VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1): font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  On 03/27/2023, at approximately 0246 hours, I, Tpr. Tripp #7333 with the Maryland State Police La Plata H Barrack, was on patrol, southbound Route 301 in the area of Acton lane Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland 20603 in lane two, when I observed a white Cadillac CTS, bearing Maryland registration 1DB3320, in lane one, traveling above the posted speed limit of 45 Miles Per Hour (MPH) on southbound Route 301, in the area of Acton lane, in lane one. I initiated a pace at 75 MPH, at approximately two car lengths, keeping equal speed and distance from Acton Lane to Route 228. While pacing the vehicle, I also observed the vehicle to cross over into lane two with approximately one tire length and took approximately one second before realigning back into lane one. I observed the vehicle cross over to the left turn lane with approximately one tire length and took approximately one second before realigning back into lane one. I then observed the vehicle cross over to lane two with approximately one tire length and took approximately two seconds before realigning back into lane one.I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on southbound Route 5, in the area of Route 925, Waldorf, Charles County Maryland, 20603 in lane two. As I approached the vehicle, I noticed the white Cadillac had an inoperable registration light.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  Upon contact with the driver, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. I requested the driver for his drivers license and registration, which he displayed. I was able to identify the driver through his Maryland drivers license as, Harvey, Jason Sean (A.A/M, DOB: 05/13/1983). I asked Harvey if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages, he advised he had a glass of wine. On my second approach to the vehicle, I noticed Harvey was now chewing gum. I advised Harvey that I needed him to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) to which Harvey agreed. I performed a pat down for weapons on Harvey and I located a cork in his right sweater pocket. I asked Harvey if the cork is from the wine bottle, he advised yes. I then ask Harvey to remove the gum.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  Cpl. Manning #6421 assisted with the traffic stop. While standing in front of Harveys vehicle, I noticed Harvey was wearing glasses and I asked if he wears contacts as well, he stated not in a long time. I asked Harvey does he need glasses to drive, he advised yes. I asked Harvey did he have any head injuries or concussions, he advised no. I asked if there were any medical conditions that I should be aware of, Harvey advised no. I asked Harvey if there is anything that I should be aware of, he advised no. I asked Harvey if he can perform the Walk and Turn (WAT) and the One Leg Stand (OLS) test, he advised yes. I asked Harvey if he is a diabetic or have high blood pressure, he advised he has high blood pressure. I then asked Harvey if he could visibly see my pen from the 12 to 15 inches distance from his face without glasses, he advised yes.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST: (4/6 clues observed).  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Harveys eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping hishead still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with hiseyes until told to stop. Hispupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. Hewas positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Harvey removed his glasses before beginning the test.  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Harvey displayed equal pupil size, equal tracking and no resting nystagmus in both eyes.  Harvey displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  Harvey displayed nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  Harvey did not display nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  VERTICAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS:  Harvey did not display vertical nystagmus in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN: (5/8 clues observed).  Prior to Harvey performing the test, Iexplained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Harvey was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed and demonstrated to place hishands flat at hissides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Hewas advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. Hewas instructed to keep hishands flat at hissides, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Harvey was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with hisrear foot to turn completely around. Harvey was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Hewas instructedonce he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hissides, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud. Harvey was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  Harvey wore gray sneakers for the test.  Harvey could not keep his balance before beginning the test.  Harvey stopped on his ninth step on his first set on nine steps.  Harvey made an improper turn by taking one step to turn around instead of series of small steps as instructed.  Harvey stepped off-line on his first step on his second set of nine steps.  Harvey missed heel-to-toe on his second step on his second set of nine steps.  ONE LEG STAND: (1/4 clues observed)  Prior to Harvey performing the test, Iexplained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Hewas instructed to stand with hisheels together and hands down by hissides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of hischoice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While hisleg was raised he was to keep hisleg straight, watch hisraised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Harvey was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  0-10 seconds  Harvey swayed at seven and ten seconds.
