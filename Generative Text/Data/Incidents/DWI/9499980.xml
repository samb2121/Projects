NARRATIVE:   Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:   On 05/05/2023 at approximately 0110 hours, I, TFC Ramsay, was on patrol in the area of Main Street and northbound Route 13 Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland At the above date and time, I was sitting stationary at a steady red traffic light. As my light turned green I observed two vehicles travel through the steady red light that was for northbound traffic. I observed one of those vehicles to be a green Jeep bearing Maryland registration 8EZ3995. I turned right and approached the green Jeep. I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact:  I exited my vehicle and contacted the operator of the vehicle, Emonte Montaisa Tyrika Jones (B/F 08/16/1998). I introduced myself, advised she was being audibly and visually recorded, and the reason for the stop. Jones stated I was trying to change my music if I was swerving as I was introducing myself. While speaking with her I observed her eyes to be watery and glassy and the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from inside the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Jones advised she and her sister had been at Brew River earlier. I know Brew River to be an establishment where alcohol is served and consumed. Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening: I asked Jones if she wanted to perform standardized field sobriety tests. Jones agreed to perform standardized field sobriety tests. While speaking with Jones outside the vehicle, I again detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage, but this time it was coming from her breath and person.  Pre-Screening Questions:  I asked Jones a series of questions prior to performing Standardized Field Sobriety Tests: * Visual check of inside of Joness mouth: clear * Glasses: Jones was not wearing glasses * Medications: N/A * Injuries: N/A I then began Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and I started with the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus:    I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Jones. After explaining the test I asked her if she understood the test and if she had any questions. Jones stated she understood the test and I began. Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues: 6 of 6   Walk and Turn: Weather: Clear Surface: Level asphalt free of debris.    I instructed Jones into the instructional phase. I then explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn test to Jones. I asked Jones if she understood the test, and she stated that she understood. Jones began the test.   Instructional Phase: Broke balance Started too soon   Walking stage 1st 9: Missed heel to toe Used arms for balance  Turn: Incorrect Walking stage 2nd 9: Stopped walking Missed heel to toe Used arms for balance   Total Walk and Turn Clues:6 of 8   One Leg Stand: I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Jones. I asked Jones if she understood the test and she stated she did.  Clues: Raised arms   Total One Leg Stand Clues:1 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test    I explained to Jones the reasons for using a preliminary breath test and asked if she wanted to submit a breath sample. Jones provided a sample of .14  I asked Jones on a scale of 1-10 how drunk she felt and she advised a 7 or 8.  Arrest and Transport:    Based on the following, I had reason to believe Jones was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  * Eyes watery, and glassy * Admittance of consuming alcoholic beverage * The odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person * My observed signs of impairment * Joness driving behavior   I placed Jones under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0128 hours. I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights to Jones, and she refused to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 at 0205 hours. Jones was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was released to a sober driver.  I request this case closed. </NarrativeText>
