         <NarrativeText>Incident captured on BWC and In car camera.  Defendant: Shadi AL GARARHEH Date of Birth: 05/27/1994 Date of Arrest: 01/20/2023 Times of Arrest: 0000 hours MD DL #: MD-10272766795  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On Thursday, January 19, 2023 at approximately 2300 hours, I (TFC Eckhardt #6469) was on duty and in uniform in un-marked Maryland State Police vehicle G-10. At approximately that time, the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack dispatched me to the area of Route 30 at the Southern Traffic Circle for a single vehicle collision into the woods. While enroute to the area, Hampstead Police Officers Emery and Vanik arrived out with the vehicle and started to provide the Barrack with information. I responded to the area and observed a silver Toyota RAV 4 into the wood line, near the southern traffic circle. This area would be best described as if you were traveling south on Business Route 30 out of Hampstead, the sharp right handed turn just before you enter the traffic circle. Hampstead PD and S/Tpr. Reuschling were already on scene. S/Tpr. Reuschling explained that he made contact with the sole occupant of the vehicle who stated that he was driving. The subject was identified by his Maryland Drivers License as Shadi Al Gararheh. He stated to S/Tpr. Reuschling that he slid on ice which caused him to crash. Let it be known that the roadway was wet from rain earlier in the evening; however, temperatures were in the low 40s and the weather had cleared up. Al Gararheh then changed his statement to S/Tpr. Reuschling that he swerved to avoid an animal in the roadway.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached Al Gararheh, who was standing on the grassy shoulder with Hampstead PD Officers. I asked him what took place and he explained that he was coming home from CR Pub with his friends and attempted to avoid an animal that was crossing the roadway, lost control and ended up in the woods. While speaking with Al Gararheh, I immediately observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy and I detected a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person as he spoke. I asked him how much he had to drink prior to driving and he stated, Not much. When I asked him to elaborate he explained that he had a beer and some wings with his last beer being over two hours ago.  AL GARARHEH consented to standardized field sobriety testing.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the paved shoulder of Business Route 30. The surface was wet, had a slight decline to the south, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear. Lighting conditions consisted of light from my flashlight and patrol vehicle headlights. All flashing emergency equipment was deactivated for the tests. AL GARARHEH appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.   I asked AL GARARHEH the following questions:  Glasses or Contacts  Glasses Medical Conditions  None Injuries  None Medication  Anti-depressants and 20mg Adderall   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from AL GARARHEHS eyes. AL GARARHEH was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. AL GARARHEHs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.   1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Observed 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Observed 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Not observed  WALK AND TURN (2/8 clues observed)  Prior to AL GARARHEH performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. After provided the verbal and physical instructions for the test, I asked AL GARARHEH if he understood the test and he stated, Yes.   Instructional Stage:  1.) Lost balance - Feet broke apart and he stepped offline on several occasions.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Counted his steps as one one-thousand, two one-thousand and so on 2.) Took very slow and deliberate steps. 3.) Took 9 steps.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Counted his steps as one one-thousand, two one-thousand and so on 2.) Took very slow and deliberate steps. 3.) Took 9 steps.  Turn: Turned to the right by pivoting both feet, not as instructed   ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed)  Prior to AL GARARHEH performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. AL GARARHEH then raised his left foot.   Instructional Stage:  Nothing to report  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-30:   Put foot down at count Eight One-Thousand.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from body for balance.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Counted to Eight One-Thousand in the allotted 30 seconds of time  While on scene, Al Gararheh was offered a preliminary breath test which he agreed to take. I administered PBT #14046 which had a result of 0.14 BrAC.  ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe AL GARARHEH was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely:  * Failing to control vehicle resulting in vehicle leaving the roadway and striking trees and shrubbery. * Bloodshot and glassy eyes. * Moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage on breath and person. * Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages before driving. * Clues during standardized field sobriety testing.  Due to the number of observations, I concluded AL GARARHEH was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0000 hours, I placed AL GARARHEH under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. A preliminary mouth check was conducted while on scene and his mouth found to be empty.  AL GARARHEH was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle per department policy and his seat belt fastened. I transported Al Gararheh to the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack for processing.  We arrived at the Westminster Barrack without incident. While at the Barrack, I read the Maryland DR-15 Advice of Rights verbatim to AL GARARHEH. At 0030 hours, AL GARARHEH refused to take the breath test.   INTOXIMETER RESULT:  ****REFUSAL****   AL GARARHEH was provided copies of all pertinent paperwork and advised that he cannot operate a motor vehicle for 12 hours from the time he was released, he was released to his father at the Westminster Barrack.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
