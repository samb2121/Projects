         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-341 R CLAGGETT ID: 23-MSP-022650 Defendant: Larnelle Daniel Claggett TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On June 24, 2023 at approximately 0120 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Bengies Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a white Ford Crown Victoria failing to drive within a single lane and failure to stop at a steady red traffic signal. The Ford was bearing Maryland registration 3CP0835.    Right over dotted white lane line with approximately half the width of the Ford, then reentered lane one.  Right over dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.  Right over dotted white lane line with approximately half the width of the Ford. The Ford straddled the dashed white lane line for approximately 500 yards then changed into lane two without a signal.  Left over dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Changed into lane one.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires. There was another vehicle occupying lane two.  Right over dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.

Activated my emergency siren as the Ford continued on Eastern Boulevard.  Changed into lane two.  Right over dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.  Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on Eastern Boulevard at Seamaster Road.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Ford on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle. There was a female passenger. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Larnelle Daniel Claggett. While speaking with Claggett, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Ford and requested Claggett to exit his vehicle. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking to Claggett outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Claggett stated he one mixed alcoholic beverage with Vodka and one shot of Ciroc (Vodka). When asked where Claggett was coming from, he stated he was coming from Tavern in the Quarters (Bar) and was driving home. I informed Claggett that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the sidewalk off of Eastern Boulevard. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a hat, blue and white shirt, jeans, and sneakers.   I asked Claggett the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None. Physical Injuries  None. Medication  None. Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.     Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.     Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual.

At approximately 0149 hours, I placed Claggett under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for further processing.  Upon arrival at the Barrack, I provided Claggett with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Claggett was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. At 0224 hours, Claggett agreed to take a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Claggett beginning at 0216 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Claggett was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Corporal Wallace of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Claggett had a result of .17 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0243 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****.17 grams of alcohol*****  Claggett was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.
