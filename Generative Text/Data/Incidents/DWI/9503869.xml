         <NarrativeText>In-car camera operational, T-5. This incident was captured on a BWC.   Defendant:Donnie Bullock Jr. Soundex #/State: B420149014969/MD Date of Birth: 12/22/1979 Date of Arrest: 02/11/2023 Time of Arrest: 0105 hours DUI # 23-017  OFFICER EXPERIENCE:   I, TFC A. Piscopo-Bann #6748, am a sworn police officer, currently assigned to uniformed patrol withthe Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack, located at 23200 Leonard Hall Drive, Leonardtown, MD 20650. I have approximately 6 yearsof law enforcement training and experience in impaired driver detection and enforcement and Controlled Dangerous Substance (CDS) investigations,while conducting uniformed patrol.I received training in the laws pertaining to Constitutional Law, including, but not limited to, the laws pertaining to Search and Seizure. Through all of this training and experience, I am familiar with different variations of the use, packaging, and distribution of Controlled Dangerous Substances.I am certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs), Standardized Field Sobriety Instructor, Advance Roadside Impaired Driver Enforcement (ARIDE), and as a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE).I have administered SFSTs on numerous occasions, which has resulted in over 80 arrests related to driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of drugs and alcohol. I have testified in cases before the District and Circuit Courts of St. Marys County, Maryland, leading to the conviction of the defendants. I know from my training and experience that there are three phases in impaired driving detection and not every incident will have all three phases present. An arrest decision is made based on the evidence gathered as a totality of the circumstances to establish probable cause that the driver is impaired and unable to safely operate a vehicle.  SCENE PROCESSING:  I conducted a probable cause search of the vehicle and located the below listed Physical Evidence. The suspected CDS was seized and processed in accordance with MSP policy. The located firearm was seized and processed in accordance with MSP policy. The Maryland State Police Gun Center was contacted, which revealed Bullock to be prohibited from possessing/owning a firearm. A copy of the Maryland Gun Center Case Report is attached to this report.  PHYSICAL EVIDENCE:  The firearm belonging to Bullock was captured on Property Record P-343457. A MSP form 67, Chain of Custody/Lab, and a MSP form 63, Property Record, were completed and attached to the evidence Gun Box packaging. Item A: One Taurus Millennium G2 .40 caliber handgun with one magazine, and nine (9) rounds of .40 caliber ammunition.  The suspected CDS belonging to Bullock was captured on Property Record P-343458. A MSP form 67, Chain of Custody/Lab, and a MSP form 63, Property Record, were completed and attached to the CDS packaging.  Item A: One zip lock bag, containing one plastic bag, containing suspected Marijuana; Weight: 5.3 Grams. Item B: One zip lock bag, containing one plastic bag, containing suspected Marijuana; Weight: 13.9 Grams  Narrative:  On February 11, 2023, at approximately 0047 hours I, along with Tpr. Crump #7571 of the Maryland State Police, were on duty operating my unmarked patrol car T5, traveling southbound on Three Notch Road, just north of St. Johns Road, Hollywood, MD 20636, in lane number 1. I observed a silver, BMW 428i, bearing Maryland registration 6EP5364, traveling directly in front of me in lane number 1.  Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1): I observed the silver BMW cross into lane 2 with both passenger side tires and travel back into lane 1, two times. I observed the silver BMW cross over the solid white line into the left turn lane with both drivers side tires one time, then traveled back into lane 1. Additionally, Tpr. Crump paced the silver BMW for approximately one quarter mile and obtained a speed of 68 MPH in the posted 55 MPH. I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the silver BMW on Three Notch Road, south of Airport View Drive, Hollywood, MD.  Personal Contact (Phase 2): Tpr. Crump made contact, via the drivers side window, with the driver, Donnie Bullock Jr. (B/M, DOB: 12/22/1979), who was identified by his Maryland drivers license. I approached from the passengers side window. While Tpr. Crump was talking to Bullock, I observed a black female, who appeared to be asleep in the front passenger seat. The female was later identified as Kavona Shannel Rodgers (B/F, DOB: 05/26/1982) by her Maryland drivers license. I made contact with Tpr, Crump at the drivers side window, who was still talking to Bullock. Tpr. Crump advised he detected the odor of suspected Marijuana emitting from the vehicle. Tpr. Crump advised he also detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Bullocks breath and person. I made contact with Bullock and immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I also detetcted the odor of suspected Marijuana emitting from the vehicle. I asked Bullock if Rodgers had any identification, to which he replied he did not know, but it was possibly in her purse. Bullock advised Rodgers is an EMT, and he is a plumber. I asked Bullock about the odor of suspected Marijuana emitting from the vehicle, at which point, Rodgers woke up and stated there was no Marijuana located in the vehicle. Bullock stated I was not detecting Marijuana in his vehicle. Bullock advised there was nothing coming from his vehicle to make me think I should conduct a probable cause search. Rodgers again stated there was no Marijuana located inside the vehicle.Bullocks speech at times was slurred and slow. I observed Bullocks movements to be slow and lethargic and his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. Tpr. Crump and I asked Bullock to step out of the vehicle, to which he complied. While Bullock was outside the vehicle, Tpr. Crump and I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3):  The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of southbound Three Notch Road, south of Airport View Drive, Hollywood, Maryland, 20636 in front of Bullocks vehicle. The surface was dry, level, and free from any debris or obstructions. The weather was clear, and the lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicles headlights, Tpr. Crumps flashlight, and ambient streetlights. My patrol vehicles forward facing emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Bullock did not display any visible injuries, limps, or limb ailments. Tpr. Crump preformed all Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, while I observed. See his supplement to this report.   It should be noted, during the Walk and Turn test, Bullock became verbally argumentative and stated to me, You dont have to speak to me about anything. Bullock stated, Im not over intoxicated. Im bringing my friend home. Bullock stated, Let me go on about my business, and, These tests are wild and not systematic. Bullock repeatedly told Tpr. Crump and I to run his drivers license and vehicle registration and to let him go. During the One Leg Stand test, Bullock stated he was not refusing to do the rest of the test. Bullock told us to give him the rest of the test, so he could, Go on about his business. Bullock refused to preform the One Leg Stand test after Tpr. Crump began to explain it to him. I asked Bullock if he would consent to a Preliminary Breath Test, to which he consented.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) This is a voluntary breath test that is administered to obtain an indication of the persons alcohol concentration. My PBT (serial #70008053) is tested monthly for accuracy, and it was found to be working properly. Bullock was offered the PBT, and he did consent to the preliminary breath test. BrAC was a .10.  Arrest:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Bullock was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath  Eyes glassy and bloodshot  Slow and lethargic movements  Slow, slurred speech  The admission of consuming an alcoholic beverage before driving (See Tpr. Crumps Supplement.)  Uncoordinated  Unable to follow a traffic control device  Unable to control vehicle speed, traveling above the posted speed limit  The observed clues of impairment while he performed standardized field sobriety tests    I arrested Bullock for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0105 hours. Bullocks mouth was checked at the time of arrest. Nothing was located inside his mouth. Bullock did not place any items in his mouth or remove anything from his mouth. Isecured Bullock in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and seat belted him normally. Tpr. Louderback #6738 of the Maryland State Police, had arrived on scene at approximately 0055 hours, while field sobriety was being conducted. At approximately 0110 hours, I, along with Tpr. Crump, conducted a probable cause search of the vehicle. One plastic bag containing suspected Marijuana was located in the front drivers side door pocket, and one plastic bag containing suspected Marijuana was located in the glove box of the vehicle. I located a black, Taurus, Millennium G2, .40 caliber handgun (serial number: SIT16936) in the center console of the vehicle. The Taurus was loaded with one (1) .40 caliber round in the chamber and eight (8) .40 caliber rounds in the magazine.Bullock freely advised the black Taurus was notregistered, and he carriesit for protection. The Leonardtown Barrack Duty Officer Cpl. Jackson #5561 of the Maryland State Police, contacted the Maryland Gun Center, who advised Bullock was prohibited to possess/carry any firearms due to a conviction for a disqualifying crime classified as a felony. A copy of the Maryland Gun Center Case Report is attached to this report. I identified thesuspected Marijuana as a Schedule One through my training, knowledge and experiencewith the MarylandState Police and prior drug arrests. Rodgers had no knowledge of the CDS and firearm located in the vehicle. Bullocks vehicle was towed by Southern Maryland Towing. Bullock was transported to the Leonardtown Barrack for processing. While inside my vehicle, I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Bullocks breath and person. Once at the Leonardtown Barrack, Bullock was read his DR-15, Advice to Rights, in English by Tpr. Crump. Bullock agreed to submit to the intoximeter test at approximately 0205 hours. Bullock was read his Miranda Rights, which he freely and voluntarily waived at approximately 0242 hours, as evidenced by his signature on the Maryland State Police Advice of Miranda Rights, MSP Form 180. Cpl. Warrick #6324 of the Maryalnd State Police Gun Enforcement Unit responded to the Leonardtown Barrack to interview Bullock. However, Bullock refused to answer any questions during the interview.  ***INTOXIMETER RESULT*** ***.13 BrAC***   I cited Bullock for Possession of Marijuana, Personal Use, on a Uniform Civil Citation (Citation number: 3Z46638280). A copy of the Uniform Civil Citation is attached to this report. The citation was forwarded to the St. Marys County District Court. Bullock was charge with the appropriate traffic violations and related firearm charges, and transported to the St. Marys County Detention Center to be held pending a bond review with the District Court Commissioner. I subsequently responded to the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack and processed the evidence, per MSP policy.  Charges:  Bullock was charged with the following: PS 5-314 Transporting handgun while under the influence of Alcohol, CR 4-203(a)(1)(v) Loaded handgun in vehicle, PS 5-133.1 Illegal possession of ammunition, PS 5-133(b) Illegal possession of a regulated firearm, CR 5-622 CDS-Possession of firearms, CR 4-203 Handgun in vehicle, TA 21-902(a1i) Driving vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (2J800RJP), TA 21-902(a1ii) Driving vehicle under the influence of alcohol Per Se (2J90RJP), TA 21-902(b1i) Driving vehicle while impaired by alcohol (2JB0RJP), TA 21-901.1(b) Negligent driving vehicle in careless and imprudent manner endangering property, life and person (2JC0RJP), TA 21-901.1(a) Reckless driving vehicle in wanton and willful disregard for safety of persons and property(2JD0RJP), TA 21-801.1 Exceeding the posted maximum speed limit:68 MPH in a posted 55 MPH zone (2JF0RJP), and TA 21-201(a1) Driver failure to obey properly placed traffic control device instructions (2JG0RJP).

         <NarrativeText>In-car camera operational, T-5. This incident was captured on a Body Worn Camera. Defendant: Donnie Bullock JR Soundex #/State:B420149014969/MD Date of Birth: 12/22/1979 Date of Arrest: 02/11/2023 Time of Arrest: 0105 DUI # 23-017  Narrative:  On February 11, 2013 at approximately 0047 hours, I was on duty, operating my unmarked patrol vehicle, T-5 along with TFC. Piscopo-Bann #6748. I was traveling southbound on Three Notch Road, north of St. Johns Road, Hollywood, MD 20636 in lane number 1. At that time, I observed a silver, BMW 428i, bearing Maryland registration 6EP5364, traveling directly in front of me in lane number 1  Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1):  I observed the silver BMW to cross over the solid white line, into the left turn lane, with both drivers side tires one time, then traveled back into lane 1. Additionally, I paced the silver BMW for approximately one quarter mile and obtained a speed of 68 MPH in the posted 55 MPH. I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the silver BMW on Three Notch Road, south of Airport View Drive, Hollywood, MD. The vehicle took approximately eleven seconds to react to my emergency lights and move over to the right shoulder.  Personal Contact (Phase 2):  I made contact with the driver of the vehicle, Donnie Bullock JR. (B/M, DOB:12/22/1979), who was identified by his Maryland drivers license. Upon contact with the driver, Bullock advised that he was taking his passenger friend home after she had too many drinks and did not want her to drive. Bullock stated that the reason he was all over the road was because he was talking to the passenger and following his GPS. When I observed the passenger, she was asleep in the passenger seat. The passenger was identified as Kavona Shannel Rodgers (B/F, DOB:05/26/1982). I asked where they were coming from. Bullock stated they were coming from a bar. I then asked Bullock how many drinks he had. His reply was that he had like two. While speaking with Bullock, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I observed his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I also detected the odor of Marijuana emitting from the vehicle. Bullock was then asked to provide his license and registration. Bullock first attempted to locate his registration in his wallet. Bullock then reached towards the glove compartment of the vehicle. When Bullock opened the glove compartment, I immediately noticed a bag of suspected Marijuana in plain view. I then notified TFC Piscopo-Bann that there would be a probable cause search on the vehicle. I requested Bullock to perform the standardized field sobriety tests, to which he consented. While Bullock was outside the vehicle, I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3):  The evaluation was performed on Three Notch Road in front of Bullocks vehicle. The surface was dry, level, and free from any debris or obstructions. The weather was clear, and the lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicles headlights, my flashlight, and ambient streetlights. My patrol vehicles forward facing emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Bullock did not display any visible injuries, limps, or limb ailments.  I asked Bullock the following questions:  Glasses/Contacts: None  Medical Conditions: None  Medication: None  Injuries: None  It should be noted that, when I asked if Bullock was on any medications or if he had glasses or contacts, he said no, but then he stated Ive been drinking a little bit.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The end of my black pen was used as the tests stimulus and was held approximately 15 inches from, and slightly above, Bullocks eyes. He was instructed to keep his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Bullocks pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  **Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Present  It should be noted, Bullock had to be reminded to follow the stimulus two times. While performing the test, Bullock stopped during the Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation portion of the test, and he stated, I dont know what type of test youre running man. At this point, I advised Bullock to follow the stimulus and continue the test. When checking for vertical Nystagmus, I advised that Bullock could raise his eyebrows to help see the stimulus. Bullock stated, I dont have to do anything. Im following the pen.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  Prior to Bullock performing this test, Bullock became aggravated with why we were performing any test. I explained to Bullock it was to ensure he was safe to drive. Before I could explain the instructions, Bullock argued that his license and car registration was good and that he should be allowed to go. He stated, theres nothing else for me to do, and youre asking me a whole lot. Bullock again advised that he was taking a friend home, and they had come from a bar, where they were drinking. When getting Bullock into the instructional phase of the test, he began the test without being instructed to do so. Bullock was then instructed to get back into the instructional phase and not start until I asked him to begin the test. Bullock was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot, touching heel to toe. Bullock was instructed to place his hands at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Bullock advised he understood. Bullock was advised to take nine (9) steps on an imaginary line, touching heel to toe. Bullock was instructed to keep his hands at his side. On the ninth step, Bullock was explained and demonstrated to plant his lead foot and to take a series of small steps to turn around. Bullock was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps.  Instructional Stage:    Bullock stepped out of the instructional stagewith is right foot moving to hisright.  Bullock began the test on his own without being instructed to or explained the full test. He also was unable to stay balanced and would not stay in the instructional position as instructed.  Walking Stage (1st Nine Steps):    Bullockstepped off-line with is right foot moving to hisright.  Bullock missed heel to toe more than a half inchon his ninth step.  Bullock stopped the test during his ninth step.  Turning Stage    Completed an improper turn; Bullock was explained how to complete the turn before the test. During the test, Bullock stopped and became argumentativeabout the turn. I explained the turn again during the test. Instead of completing theturn, Bullock began to walk backwards.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine Steps):    Bullock did not perform the second half of the test as instructed;instead, he walked backwards.   It should be noted before performing the turn, Bullock became argumentative and stated, What type of test do you have me running? Thats some type racist ass shit. Bullock then proceeded with the test. Instead of completing the turn as instructed, Bullock began walking backwards. After completing the walk and turn test, I explained to Bullock there was another test. Bullock then asked to speak with my supervisor, and I said he could speak with TFC Piscopo-Bann. When TFC Piscopo-Bann tried to speak with Bullock, he stated, You dont have to speak to me about anything. TFC Piscopo asked if he would continue the test or if he was refusing to continue. Bullock then stated, Im not refusing anything. I dont have to cooperate, but Im not refusing. Bullock was explained that there was one more test to complete and a voluntary preliminary breath test he could complete. Bullock advised again he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.  ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed)  When I was explaining the one leg stand, Bullock advised that he had been drinking again. Bullock did not complete the one leg stand and chose to take the preliminary breath test (PBT). The PBT was administered to Bullock by TFC Piscopo-Bann.          </NarrativeText>
