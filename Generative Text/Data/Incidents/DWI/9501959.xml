         <NarrativeText>***** SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER ***** N-12 is equipped with a mobile recording device. Defendant: Javier Luis Lucas  Date of Birth: 12/01/1959 Date of Arrest: 10/27/2023 Time of Arrest: 2357 hours MD SDX: MD-10273251595  DUI #: 23-233 (Rockville)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Certified by NHTSA to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) * Certified as a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator  * Certified in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE)  * Attended the 2021 Maryland Impaired Driving Conference in Ocean City, Maryland * Participated in several DUI Special Assignments * DUI Award Recipient for 2021  2022. * Gaithersburg Germantown Chamber of Commerce Award Recipient 2023 * Since 2020 have made over 120 DUI arrest VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Friday, October 27th, 2023 at approximately 2337 hours, I, Trooper First Class Canizalez #7087, was on patrol on northbound Route 650 in the area of Fox Street, Silver Spring, Montgomery County Maryland, when I observed a white Toyota Tundra bearing Maryland Registration 6EK0447 traveling at approximately 10 MPH in a 35 MPH zone. I observed the vehicle make a right turn and drive over the right curb with both right tires and strike a parked unattended black Toyota Camry with its front end.  CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the vehicle and contacted the driver on his drivers side. I introduced myself and informed the driver the reason for the stop and asked for his license. Immediately, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from within the vehicle. I observed other signs of impairment on the driver such as heavy slurred speech and bloodshot and glassy eyes. I questioned the driver of his travels and he stated he was coming from a friends house and was headed home. During my second approach I observed that the driver had urinated on himself. The driver was identified by his Maryland Drivers License as: LUCAS, Javier Luis. (MD SDX: MD-10273251595, H/M, DOB: 12/01/1959) I asked LUCAS to step out of the vehicle for further questioning. While speaking with LUCAS from outside of his vehicle, I questioned the him on how many alcoholic beverages he consumed that night prior to driving and he stated he had 1 corona beer bottle a few minutes prior to driving. I continued to detect the odor of a strong alcoholic beverage from his breath even with traffic passing. I asked the driver if he was willing to perform voluntary SFSTs and he advised that he would. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the side walk on Fox Street in the area of Route 650. (pavement). The surface was dry, level and free from any debris. The weather was clear and light condition consisted of my flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. LUCAS was not displaying any injuries. Prior to beginning the test, I asked LUCAS the following questions: Glasses or Contacts: None. Medical Conditions: None. Injuries: None.  Medications: None.  ***** During each phase of the test, LUCAS was unable to perform or follow along to any instruction due to his impairment. LUCAS was unable to follow my pen and stared straight at me, was unable to place his feet in the instructional phase and then OLS was not even offered due to the drivers impairment as his safety came first. ***** *TEST #1 HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): 0/6 * The driver was unable to perform the test due to his impairment.  *TEST #2 WALK AND TURN (WAT): 0/8 * The driver was unable to perform the test due to his impairment.  *TEST #3 ONE LEG STAND (OLS): 0/4  * The driver was unable to perform the test due to his impairment.  I offered LUCAS a preliminary breath test and he advised that he would take it and began to blow several times not into the straw. Lucas provided an insufficient breath sample and just barely blew into the straw but the Preliminary Breath Test was able to capture a sample.  PBT BrAC results: .15 ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe LUCAS was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of an alcoholic beverage: * LUCAS failed to control his speed to avoid a collision.  * LUCAS failing to drive right of center and drive on the right curb with both right tires.  * LUCAS traveling at a speed lower than the posted speed limit (approximately 10 mph in a 30-35mph zone) prior to striking vehicle 2.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from LUCAS breath. * Bloodshot and glassy eyes. * Heavily slurred speech * LUCAS admitting to have consumed 1 Corona beer bottle approximately a few minutes prior to driving.  * LUCAS hysterically laughing while outside during SFSTs * LUCAS unable to position himself properly for the WAT. * LUCAS urinating on himself in his car during my approach and a second time while seated in my vehicle.  Due to the number of observations, I had reason to believe LUCAS was driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and was unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2357 hours, I placed LUCAS under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol. A preliminary search of LUCAS was conducted on the scene and it revealed that he had nothing on his person and was later transported to the Montgomery County 4th District. Prior to entering the 4th District Station, LUCAS was read his DR15 Advise of Rights and refused to submit to the intoximeter test at 0013 hours. LUCAS was then transported to his residence.  INTOXIMETER RESULT  REFUSAL LUCAS was given all pertinent paperwork and was later released to his relatives at 0105 hours.  Case status: closed by arrest. All events occurred in MontgomeryCounty, Maryland </NarrativeText>
