         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-003536 Tpr Lebga #7447 Forestville Barrack CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING: -NHTSA CERTIFIED TO CONDUCT STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFST). -CERTIFIED PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) OPERATOR. Date and Time Occurred: 01/28/2023 at 0901 hours Victim: State of Maryland Suspect: Amish Ajay Patel A/M, DOB 06/22/1995 of 2901 Crain Highway, Upper Marlboro, MD, 20774 Phone # (301)-675-2788 Narrative: THIS INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED BY A MOBILE VIDEO RECORDER AND BODY CAM (MSP MARKED VEHICLE L-22 EQUIPPED WITH MVR) DUI #- 23-033  DESCRIPTION OF VIOLATION / INCIDENT / TRAFFIC STOP (VEHICLE IN MOTION): On 01/28/2023 at approximately 0901 hours, I, Tpr Lebga, #7447, was dispatched from the Forestville Barrack to Southbound Crain Highway at Beech Tree Parkway, MD, for a single-vehicle collision. Upon my arrival, I observed a black BMW 740i bearing Maryland registration 8ED1844 in the center median against the guardrail. It was determined that the vehicle traveled off-road and struck the guardrail.  INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE DEFENDANT (PERSONAL CONTACT): The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Amish Ajay Patel, DOB 06/22/1995, A/M. Patel was standing on the side of the road. Patel stated that an unknown Nissan rear-ended his vehicle and fled the scene. I observed rear-side damage on the vehicle that could have resulted from having been struck by another vehicle. While speaking with Patel, I smelled a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and observed his eyes to be red and glassy. I asked Patel how much he had to drink, and he stated he had some wine about 12 hours ago. I asked Patel what the name of the wine was, and he stated that he was not sure of the name. I asked Patel if he was willing to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to which he elected to submit to. I explained and demonstrated each test prior to Patel being asked to perform them. I asked Patel if had any medical condition that I needed to be madeaware of and Patel stated yes. Patel stated that he had high blood pressure and diabetes, and he was currently taking medication. Patel also stated that he wears glasses which he currently had on at that time.  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs): The tests were performed on a flat, level surface and the test area was free of debris. Patel was advised to stand with his feet together and arms by his side. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12-15 inches from Patels eyes. Patel was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes, until told to stop. Patel stated yes when asked if he understood the instructions.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED) -Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes (Two (2) clues) -Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes (Two (2) clues) -Onset of nystagmus prior to forty-five (45) degrees in both eyes (Two (2) clues)  WALK AND TURN (1/8 CLUES OBSERVED) Prior to Patel performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Patel was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of the left foot and touch heel to toe. Patel was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in the position until told to begin. Patel was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. Patel was advised to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step, Patel was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Patel was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Patel was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. When asked if he understood the instructions Patel stated Yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Patel was unable to stand with his feet together and arms by his side during the instructional phase. At this point, Patel was not following any instructions given and stated that he wanted to talk with his lawyer. Patel stopped performing the test and refused to resume.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Patel was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  Eyes bloodshot.  Watery eyes.  Admission to consuming some wine.  Not being able to properly follow instructions.  My observed signs of impairment as he performed the HGN test.  Refusing to complete the Walk and Turn, and One Leg Stand test.   I arrested Patel for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0955 hours. Prior to being placed in my patrol vehicle, Patel was searched and one (1) multicolored vape pen containing a thick clear-golden oil suspected to be THC oil was found on the left side jacket pocket. The vape pen was seized at the Forestville Barrack, packaged, and processed in accordance with the Maryland State Police policies and procedures. Patel was played an English audio DR-15 Advice of Rights at 1020 hours and Patel refused to submit to the intoximeter test. Patel was transported to the Forestville Barrack. Patel was issued the appropriate citations and released to a sober driver.  Traffic Charges: 1.) Driving vehicle under the influence of alcohol. 2.) Driving vehicle on highway contrary to law. 3.) Driving while impaired by alcohol. 4.) Driving vehicle while so far impaired cannot drive safely.   All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. CASE CLOSED by arrest </NarrativeText>
