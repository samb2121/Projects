I am A.R.I.D.E (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) Certified.  INITIAL CALL FOR SERVICE  On 01/21/2023 at approximately 0204 hours, I Tpr.Fuller #7354 was on duty operating Marked Unit J-10 in the Annapolis area. I was conducting stationary LIDAR, monitoring traffic Northbound Rowe Blvd at College Creek. At that time, I observed a silver Ford Mustang traveling in lane 1 that appeared to be exceeding the posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour. I directed the LIDAR set at the vehicle and obtained a speed reading of 55 miles per hour at a distance of 677 feet. I am certified by the Maryland State Police to operate LIDAR and it was tested before and after my tour of duty and was found to be working properly.  INITIAL CONTACT:  I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver, sole occupant of the silver Ford Mustang. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Zachary Alexander Kittleson (2/M, DOB: 08-02-1998). I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. I noticed Kittlesons eyes to be glassy and bloodshot. While conversing with Kittleson I detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I asked how many alcoholic beverages he had tonight prior to operating his motor vehicle. Kittleson said he had three drinks, three hours ago. I asked Kittleson to step out of the vehicle to conduct the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS:  The tests were conducted on a flat paved area free of debris. My patrol vehicle was positioned in a safe manner, with my forward emergency lights deactivated during all three tests. I asked Kittleson if he had any physical injuries that would prevent him from performing the tests. I asked Kittleson if he had any head injuries. Kittleson advised No. When asked if he was taking any medications, Kittleson replied No. Kittleson was not wearing glasses or contacts at the time of the tests.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Kittlesons eyes. Kittleson was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only. Kittleson was instructed to follow the tip of the pen with his eyes only until told to stop. Kittleson pupils were of equal size and showed equal tracking. Kittleson was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  4.) Vertical Nystagmus present  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual.  Kittleson was asked if he understood my instruction of the test and he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage:  1.Nothing was observed   Walking Stage (1st Nine):  1. Missed Heel to Toe on step 3  2.Steps off line on oneoccasion  Turn:  Performed as instructed  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  1.Missed Heel to Toe on step 2 and 3  2.Steps off line on two occasion  ONE LEG STAND (2/4)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual.  Kittleson was asked if he understood my instruction of the test and he stated, Yes.  First 10 seconds  Puts foot down twice  Second 10 seconds  Puts foot down twice  Third 10 seconds  Nothing observed  PBT Test  Was offered and refused  ACTION TAKEN:  Kittleson was arrested at 0218 hours and transported to the MSP Annapolis Barrack for processing. I played the DR-15 audibly from the MVA website (Advice of Rights) to Kittleson in English at 0243 hours. Kittleson was given a paper copy of the DR-15 to read along with the audio. Kittleson was asked to submit to an alcohol concentration test at the barrack. Kittleson agreed to submit a sample of his breath. BaC tests results showed that Kittleson breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of 0.14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Kittleson was charged appropriately for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.
