         <NarrativeText>Defendant: Clifton Maurice Bradley Date of Birth: 03/18/1973 Date of Arrest: 11/08/2023 Times of Arrest: 1146 DUI #: 23-108   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Trained and in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE).  NARRATIVE:    This incident was recorded by body worn camera (BWC). On Wednesday, 11/08/2023 at 1122 hours, I responded to a motor vehicle collision on N/B I-81 N/O 2 MM. While en-route, I was advised by the Hagerstown Barrack that the complainant stated that the operator of an involved blue Chevrolet Corvette was acting strangely, was walking towards the wood-line, and was possibly intoxicated. Upon arriving on scene, I identified the Corvettes WV registration as 48M941. The Corvette was parked on the right shoulder and had damage on the driver side, including a flat driver side front tire. The second vehicle involved was a Fed-Ex tractor-trailer and was approximately 100 yards north of the Corvette on the right shoulder. While speaking with a witness, Terry Malloy, I observed a subject staggering unsteadily towards me from the tree-line. Malloy identified this subject as the driver of the Corvette. For details of the collision, see attached ACRS Report 23MSP039434.    I then made contact with that subject, who confirmed he was the driver of the Corvette. I asked him for his drivers license, vehicles registration card, and proof of insurance. He provided me with his WV vehicle registration card but indicated he did not have his WV DL. He identified himself to me as Clifton Maurice Bradley (B/M, 03/18/1973). I verified his identity via METERS by his WV DL photograph.   While speaking with Bradley, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. Additionally, I observed his eyes to be glassy, his speech to be slurred, and he was very unsteady on his feet. While speaking with him, he needed to lean on the front of his vehicle for support. I asked Bradley how much alcohol he consumed prior to driving and he responded none. I told him that I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person, his speech was slurred, his eyes were glassy, and he was having difficulty simply standing upright. He then stated that he consumed one beer prior to driving. I asked him if he took any medication prior to driving and he responded in the affirmative, but was unable to specify what that medication was.   I then returned to my patrol vehicle to begin documenting the collision. While seated in my patrol vehicle, I observed Bradley again stagger unsteadily towards the tree-line, where he then urinated. After he returned, I re-approached Bradley and asked if he would be willing to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Testing, which he then refused. I then placed Bradley under arrest for DUI at 1146 hours and secured him in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. While seated, I played the DR-15 Advice of Rights Audio for him in English from my patrol vehicles computer. He indicated that the volume of the audio was sufficient for him to hear it. After listening to the DR-15 Advice of Rights Audio, Bradley refused to submit to a test of breath at 1201 hours.   ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Bradley was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  * Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Bradleys breath and person. * Glassy eyes *Slurred speech * Admission to consuming one beer prior to driving. *Very unsteady on his feet.    I then transported Bradley to the Hagerstown Barrack, and observed that while en-route to the Hagerstown Barrack, Bradley appeared to doze off and fall asleep. Bradley was issued the appropriate paperwork and released to his girlfriend. His vehicle was removed from the scene by Freestate Towing. A dog inside the vehicle was removed from the scene by the Humane Society and transported to their facility for safekeeping.   INTOXIMETER RESULT:  N/A   All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
