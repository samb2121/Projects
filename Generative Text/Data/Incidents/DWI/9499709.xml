Ingram #6663 of the Maryland State Police Frederick Barracks in Frederick County, Maryland was provided a look-out for a red Hyundai driving on the wrong side of the roadway, in the area of Woodsboro Pike and Glade Boulevard. The unknown caller stated the vehicle entered into the Rutters located at 9210 Woodsboro Pike, Walkersville, Maryland. The driver provided a Virginia registration UJY3579. Upon arrival, I observed a red Hyundai Velstor hatchback matching the description provided. I attempted three times to contact the unknown caller, however, they did not answer the phone. I observed the vehicle to be unoccupied. I looked through the drivers side window and observed multiple bags and boxes in the back and front seat of the vehicle. I also observed a credit card with the name of Meredyth Haeme.   font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-thickness:initial"&gt;Personal Contact: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  I entered the Rutters and began to look around. I observed a white female wearing a gray shirt, black leggings and flip-flops, began to walk my way. The female made eye contact with me and immediately turned to the right and walked in the opposite direction of me. I exited the Rutters and waited for the driver of the vehicle to return. I waited approximately a minute and the same female that I described above walked out of the Rutters. I observed the female having trouble keeping her balance and almost fell as she exited the Rutters. She began to walk towards the vehicle on the sidewalk, lost her balance and stumbled over into the parking lot. I asked the female if she was okay, and she stated, yes. I helped guide her back over to the sidewalk, asked her if she was the owner of the red vehicle, she advised yes. I again asked if she was okay, and she paused and stated yes. While speaking to the female she continued to be unable to maintain her balance and was unsteady on her feet. I advised her to sit on the curb to avoid falling. She sat on the curb and began to cry and state that she wanted to go home. I asked her if she took anything that I needed to be aware of, and she stated no. I asked her if she consumed any alcohol, and she replied no, and then began to cry. I asked the female if her name was Meredyth, and she stated yes. While speaking to Meredyth, I would note that she was unable to form complete sentences, she was slurring her words, her eyes were glossy and blood shot red. I asked her if she would like to be evaluated by the Emergency Personnel, and she advised that she would. I requested EMS to respond. The arrived and evaluated Meredyth, she refused medical treatment. While EMS was with Meredyth, I spoke to her mother by phone. Her mother advised that Meredyth was just released from treatment of alcoholism, and that her and Meredyth were just in an argument earlier today. While Meredyth was in the back of the ambulance, I opened the door and I immediately could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Meredyths person. Again, I asked Meredyth if she consumed any alcoholic beverages prior to her operating her motor vehicle, and she advised, no. I advised that I can smell a strong odor coming from her direction, Meredyth, paused and stated she had some wine around 3am. I asked how many and she could not remember. She later stated that it was maybe around 3-4 pm, I want to note that around the time I was speaking to Meredyth it was 1500 hours. I made Meredyth aware of the time, and she stated it was approximately 3 maybe 4 hours ago, that she consumed some alcohol. I asked Meredyth to peform the three Standardized Field Sobriety test, she agreed. As Meredyth exited the ambulance and walked towards me, I would observe her unable to walk without losing her balance and she needed assistance when standing.    font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-thickness:initial"&gt;Pre-Arrest Screening: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;   The evaluation was performed on the Parking lot of 9210 Woodsboro Pike, Walkersville Frederick County, Maryland Rutters, on the side parking lot, away from the view of the customers and free from any parked or parking vehicles.
