         <NarrativeText>MSP marked A-14 is equipped with a mobile recording device. Traffic stop was recorded. SFST was recorded on Body Worn Camera (BWC). 23-MSP-017144  23-059   Defendant: Javier Ardon Date of Birth: 02/27/1991 Date of Arrest: 05/13/2023 Time of Arrest: 2321 hours DUI #: 23-059   CERTIFICATIONS  TRAINING  Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trained and certified in vehicle pace and operation of LIDAR and RADAR through the Baltimore County Police as met by Maryland State Police certification standards. Trained and certified in administering the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT).   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  Rear deck RADAR for A-14 was tested at the beginning of shift and found to be functioning properly at the beginning and end of shift.  On 05/13/2023 at approximately 2308 hours, I was on routine patrol on west-bound Maryland Route 100 in the area of Dorsey Marc Station, when I observed a set of headlights, in lane #1, traveling at a high rate of speed. The vehicle entered the realm of influence of the RADAR at 86mph in a posted 55mph zone. I moved to lane #2 and allowed the vehicle to pass. The vehicle in question was a tan Toyota Tacoma, bearing MD registration, 55397CK. I activated my emergency equipment, and initiated the traffic stop.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I made contact with the driver of the Tacoma, who was identified as Javier Ardon, DOB 02/27/1991, as confirmed by his Maryland drivers license. I asked Ardon where he was going, and he stated he was going home. While speaking with Ardon, while he was seated in his vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I asked Ardon how much alcohol he consumed earlier and he stated, None. I asked again, informing him I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage, emanating from the passenger area of the vehicle, and Ardon stated he was not drinking. I moved to the drivers side of the vehicle and clarified, asking what alcoholic beverages were consumed at any point in the day prior. Ardon stated he just left the LIVE Casino, in Anne Arundel County, and had two Gentleman Jack drinks. I asked Ardon if he would like to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) to determine if he was able to drive safely. Ardon then complied with my request and exited his vehicle to perform SFST. While speaking with Ardon in front of his vehicle, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. During this observation, I observed Ardon to have glassy, glazed over eyes.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the left shoulder in front of Ardons vehicle. The weather conditions were fair and illuminated by Ardons headlights and streetlights. Ardon was positioned away from other vehicles or flashing lights that could impair his ability to complete the tests offered. Ardon appeared to be in adequate physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Ardon the following questions:  Medical Conditions- None. Injuries- None. Medication- None. Glasses- None.    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The stimulus that was used was the top of my pen, and was held approximately 13 inches away from Ardons eyes. I asked Ardon if he could see the pen, and he stated, Yes. Ardon was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of my pen with his eyes until told to stop. Ardon stated he understood. Ardons pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking, and resting nystagmus was not observed. I asked Ardon if he understood again all of the instructions I provided him, and he stated, Yes. Ardon was positioned away from the vehicles to prevent any distractions. Ardons pupils were glazed over and glassy.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes.  VGN was present in Ardons eyes.    WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed)  Prior to Ardon performing the test, I properly demonstrated and explained how the test should and would be conducted. Ardon was instructed to place his right foot in front of his left foot and make heel to toe contact. Ardon was instructed to put and keep his arms at his side, and I advised him to remain in that position until told to begin. Ardon was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Ardon was instructed to keep his hands flat against his side, keeping his eyes focused on his feet, and count each step aloud. On the ninth step, Ardon was explained and demonstrated to keep the lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Ardon was again explained the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Ardon was advised that once he began the test, he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands to his side, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. I informed Ardon for demonstration purposes, that I would be taking three (3) steps, but he would be taking nine (9) steps. This information was given before and after I demonstrated the test. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Ardon if he understood the instructions to which he responded that he understood.    Instructional Stage:  Left the Instructional Stage on 1 occasion.   Walking Stage (1st Nine) Stepped off of the line on steps 1-2. Broke heel to toe contact on step 1-2.   Walking Stage (2nd Nine) Broke heel to toe contact on steps 7-8 Stepped off line on steps 7-8. Raised arms to shoulder height in order to maintain balance.   Turn: Ardon took one large step to turn around.   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)  Prior to Ardon performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Ardon was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his side while the instructions were given and during the test. Ardon was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch the raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Ardon was asked if he had any questions, and Ardon stated, No. Ardon was then asked if understood the instructions, to which he stated, Yes. Ardon lifted his left leg for the test.  Instructional Stage: Nothing to Report.   Balance and Counting Stage:  Seconds 0-10 Placed his foot down on 1 occasion. Waived arms from rib level to shoulder level in order to maintain balance. Swayed left to right in order to maintain balance.    Seconds 11-20 Ardon placed his foot down on 1 occasion. Ardon swayed from left to right in order to maintain balance. Ardon lifted arms above waist in order to maintain balance.  Seconds 21-30 Ardon placed foot down on 1 occasion. Ardon swayed from left to right in order to maintain balance. Ardon lifted arms to shoulder height in order to maintain balance.   Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Ardon decided not to submit to a preliminary breath test.    ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Ardon was driving a motor vehicle while being under the influence of alcohol:  Traveling at a high rate of speed (86/55 mph zone). Ardons sluggish stance, along with glassy, glazed over eyes. Strong odor emanating from both Ardons vehicle and his person. My observed signs of impairment as he performed the field sobriety tests. Ardons admission to consuming alcohol earlier in the night.   I arrested Ardon for driving while under the influence of alcohol at 2321 hours. Ardon was transported to the Maryland State Police, Waterloo Barrack for processing at 2325 hours. At the barrack, I provided Ardon with a copy of the DR-015, Advice of Rights, form to follow along as I played the audio form, in its entirety, from the MVA website. Ardon followed along as the audio file read the document aloud in its entirety. At the conclusion of the form, Ardon advised he did want to submit to the Intoximeter Test and signed indicating the same at 0003 hours.  20 MINUTE WAITING PERIOD:  The 20-minute waiting period began at time of arrest 2321.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: Ardon provided a valid breath sample to the Intoximeter Test of .17 BrAC at 0015 hours.  DISPOSITION: Ardons license was confiscated. He was issued Order of Suspension, DR-15A. I issued Ardon the appropriate citations, and he was picked up by his friend, Edwin, whom he contacted.   I request this case to be closed by arrest. All events occurred in Howard County, MD. </NarrativeText>
