         <NarrativeText>M-7 and Body Worn Camera operational. The incident was recorded.  Defendant: Ashlyn Margaret Mckechnie Date of Birth: 08/31/1993 Date of Arrest: 07/24/2023 Times of Arrest: 0059 hours Colorado DL#: 17-058-3508 DUI #: 23-066 (Cecil County)  VEHICLE IN MOTION:  On Monday, July 24th, 2023 at approximately 0025 hours, I, TFC Henry #6700, was on routine patrol in my Class C uniform of the day operating my marked Maryland State Police Patrol vehicle, M-7. I was conducting a routine patrol Check on Interstate 95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) in the area of the 92 mile-marker in Cecil County, Maryland. While on the patrol check, I observed a black 2008 Volvo C70 bearing Colorado registration AY0916 parked on the right shoulder of the roadway southbound I-95 at the 92.0 mile-marker. The Volvos hazards lights were activated but the running lights were off. There was tire debris on the right shoulder just north of Volvo.   PERSONAL CONTACT:  I approached the Volvo via passenger side approach. I observed there to be two occupants in the vehicle (a driver and a front right seat passenger), a dog in the rear right seat, and what appeared to be luggage in the rear left seat. I observed both the driver and passenger to be unconscious. I knocked on the door and neither the driver or passenger woke. I observed that both the driver and passenger were breathing. I observed the keys were in the ignition, engine off, but keys in the On position. I continued knocking on both the passenger side door and window and neither occupants woke. I walked around the Volvo to visually inspect it for damage. I did not observe any damage. All tires on the Volvo appeared to be in good condition. I requested another respond to my location. I continued knocking to no avail. I attempted to shake the Volvo. I observed both the driver and passengers head to be moving left to right while I shook the Volvo and still, neither woke. When another unit arrived on scene, he attempted to also knock on the door with negative results. I again shook the vehicle with negative results. We determined to request EMS respond to the scene incase this was a medical emergency. After continuing to knock on the door, the passenger started wake. We advised we were the State Police and the passenger just gave a thumbs up and stated she was good. The passenger was going in and out of consciousness. The passenger finally became coherent enough to wake the driver. The driver was advised to roll the window down. The driver rolled her right rear window down. I advised the driver to roll her drivers side window down. She complied. Cpl. Porter #6499 and I made contact with the driver who was identified by her Colorado drivers license as Ashlyn Margaret Mckechnie (W/F DOB: 08/31/1993). Mckechnie appeared to be in a daze. Her speech was mumbled and slurred and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. When Mckechnie rolled the windows to the vehicle down, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. Cpl. Porter identified himself and advised everything was being audibly and visually recorded. Mckechnie advised they were coming from Atlantic City, NJ and headed to Atlantic City, NJ. Mckechnie advised they had pulled over to sleep for a few minutes. Cpl. Porter asked Mckechnie, Have you guys had anything to drink tonight. Mckechnie responded, Yes. Cpl. Porter asked how many and Mckechnie advised, Two. Cpl. Porter asked Mckechnie if she knew where she was and she advised, Outside of Atlantic City. Cpl. Porter advised Mckechnie that they were about three hours away from Atlantic City. Mckechnie was unable to provide me with her vehicles registration. Mckechnie and her passenger refused EMS after they arrived on scene. After, I asked Mckechnie to step out of the vehicle and walk to the front of her car and she complied. I asked Mckechnie if she would be willing to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and she agreed. I again asked Mckechnie if she had anything to drink and she advised she had three drinks approximately 3 hours prior. Mckechnie advised she took Aterax for anxiety at 1000 hours on 7/23 and does not wear contacts. After separating Mckechnie from the vehicle. I still detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING:  HGN: total number of clues of impairment, six out of six. The first field sobriety test I asked Mckechnie to perform was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. I asked Mckechnie if she had any medical conditions Mckechnie stated, No. I instructed Mckechnie to keep her arms at her sides and to look directly at the tip of the stimulus. I held the stimulus approximately 12-15 inches away from the bridge of her nose, slightly above eye level. I also instructed Mckechnie to follow the stimulus with her eyes only and not to move her head. I asked Mckechnie if she had any questions and she advised, No.  During the test, Mckechnie displayed the following: -Equal tracking, equal pupil size, no resting nystagmus. -Swayed side to side while conducting the test. -Lack of smooth pursuit. -Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. -Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. -Vertical Gaze Nystagmus present.   Walk and Turn: total number of clues of impairment, eight out of eight. The second field sobriety test, I asked Mckechnie to perform was the Walk and Turn test. The surface was dry, slight downhill, and clear of debris. I asked Mckechnie if she wanted to perform the test barefoot or in her flip flops. I also advised her she could wear any other shoes she had with her. Mckechnie elected to perform the test in flip flops. Mckechnie advised me she had a hurt middle toe on her right foot. During the instructional stage, I instructed Mckechnie to place her right foot in front of her left foot, standing heel-to-toe, place both his arms at her sides and not to start the test until told to begin. Mckechnie continued putting her left foot in front of her right foot. I advised her three separate times that it was her right foot in front of her left foot. I instructed Mckechnie during the walking stage of the test to do the following: take nine heel-to-toe steps up, after the ninth step, keep her lead foot planted, and take a series of small steps in a circular motion to turn around. After turning around, touch heel-to-toe again and begin taking nine steps back touching heel-to-toe on every step. I instructed Mckechnie to look at her feet during the test, count out loud each step taken, keep her hands down to her sides for the entire test, and do not stop walking until she is complete the test. I asked Mckechnie if she had any questions and she advised, I dont think so.  During the instructional stage Mckechnie displayed the following: -Lost balance, broke heel-to-toe stance. -Started performing the test before instructed to do so.  During the walking stage Mckechnie displayed the following: On the first set of heel-to-toe steps, missed heel-to-toe by more than a half inch on steps 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Stepped off line on steps 2 and 4. Raised her arms more than 6 inches from her waste on steps 3 and 4. Mckechnie took 12 steps Mckechnie failed to keep her lead foot planted during the turn.  On the second set of heel-to-toe steps, Mckechnie took 2 steps, stopped walking, raised her hands and asked if she was done. I asked Mckechnie if she was done, and she stated I did nine. I again asked her if she was done and she advised, Yeah, I thought that was the test. I advised Mckechnie to do the test exactly how I told her to do it.   One Leg Stand: total number of clues of impairment, three out of four. The final field sobriety test, I asked Mckechnie to perform was the one leg stand. I instructed Mckechnie to keep her arms at her sides and not to start the test until instructed to do so. I instructed Mckechnie to raise her foot, whichever foot she felt comfortable with, approximately 6 inches off the ground, parallel, and pointing her toe straight. With her foot raised counting up, one-thousand one, one-thousand two, one-thousand three, and so on until instructed to stop. I asked Mckechnie if she had any questions and she advised, No.  During the test Mckechnie displayed the following: -Swayed side to side -Mumbled and slurred speech during the test. -Put foot down throughout test. -Raised arms throughout test. -Counted to one-thousand 12 after 20 seconds had elapsed.   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Mckechnie was driving a motor vehicle while impaired:  *Unconscious in drivers seat of vehicle. *Not waking up after more than five minutes of knocking on her door and shaking the vehicle. *Not knowing where she was. *Mumbled and slurred speech. *Incoherent statements. *Glassy and bloodshot eyes. *Admission to consuming an alcoholic beverage (two drinks, then three beers). *My observed signs of impairment of Mckechnie during SFSTs.  I arrested Mckechnie for driving under the influence at approximately 0059 hours. I checked Mckechnies mouth and nothing was observed. Mckechnie advised she didnt understand how she could be placed under arrest when she was not driving. Mckechnie further stated she was Feeling it and thats why she pulled over. I secured Mckechnie in my patrol vehicle. Mckechnie was transported to the JFK Memorial Highway Barrack for processing. Mckechnie was read her DR-15 (Advice of Rights) and she refused the Breath Test at 0132 hours.  Mckechnie was given copies of all pertinent paperwork and transported to the Cecil County Commissioners Office where she was released on her own recognizance.   Case closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Narrative:    On July 23, 2023 at approximately 0025 hours, I TFC. Keane of the Maryland State Police, was on duty, in full uniform, operating marked vehicle M-32. I was dispatched to I-95 south bound in the area of the 92.1 mile marker to assist another TFC. Henry with two female subjects that were unconscious and not responding. While on scene the TFC. Henry finally got the female driver and passenger to wake up. EMS was called to the scene and both the driver and passenger refused treatment. TFC. Henry put the driver through Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) and arrest was made.    I identified the passenger as Pelagie De Zo Zotamou B/F DOB: 07/24/1992, by her Maryland Drivers License. Zotamou had clearly also been drinking and had a hard time standing. Zotamous speech was slow and slurred. Myself and other Troopers made multiple attempts to try to get Zotamou to call for a ride. Zotamou was advised she was not allowed to walk on I-95, and she was not allowed to call for an Uber due to her current state. We asked multiple times if a family member, friend, coworker, or someone else who she knows could pick her and her dog up. During that time, she attempting to walk on I-95 stating Im good. Zotamou refused to call anyone. She repeatedly yelled, Fuck you! directed at Cpl. Porter 6499 who also was on scene. Zotamou acted in a disorderly manner in multiple points throughout our interaction. Finally, she lunged at Cpl. Porter who grabbed her arm before she reached him. Cpl. Porter asked Zotamou to calm down and put her hand behind her back. At this point Zotamou complied and was arrested without further issue.  All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
