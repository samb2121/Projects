The training included classroom instruction, practical application, alcohol workshops, written testing and practical application examination. Ihave been trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE).  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On August 13, 2023, at approximately 2315 hours, I, Trooper Riggs #7288, responded to the area of Maryland Rt. 17 (Burkittsville Rd.), south of Lees Ln. Knoxville, Frederick County MD 21758 for a reported single vehicle collision.  I arrived on-scene at approximately 2327 hours, with Frederick County Sheriffs Deputies, and EMS personnel. I observed a gray Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration, 5ER4438 off the left side roadway, and into the end of a guardrail. I contacted Officer Smith with the Brunswick Police department. Ofc. Smith advised they had an attempt to locate call for a vehicle matching the Hondas description for being all over the road and driving the wrong way in a traffic circle. Ofc. Smith advised he detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the driver of the Honda. Ofc. Smith also advised the driver was acting strange.  Investigation revealed the Honda was traveling north on MD 17, and traveled over the center-line, off the left side of the roadway, and struck the end of a guardrail with the front side of the vehicle.(SEE ATTACHED ACCIDENT REPORT)  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I contacted the operator of the Honda, Daisy Alejandra Reyes (O/F 06/01/1987) who I identified by her Maryland drivers license and photograph. Daisy was still seated in the drivers seat of the Honda. It should be noted the vehicles keys were still in the ignition, and the vehicle was running. Daisy is also the registered owner of the vehicle. The vehicle was also occupied by three minors, Jason Reyes (DOB 6/2/07), Jordan Reyes (DOB 10/25/2015), and Jaylaniz Reyes (6/5/2023).  Daisy was evaluated by EMS personnel and initially refused any treatment on-scene. I asked Daisy what happened. Daisy advised me she was operating the Honda, and she swerved to avoid striking a deer.  While I spoke with Daisy, I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. I observed her eyes glossy and bloodshot. Daisys speech was slurred, and she appeared to have trouble focusing on the questions I asked her. I asked Daisy several times to speak with me, and she ignored me. Daisy was very difficult to speak with. Daisy advised she did not know where she was at. I asked Daisy where she thinks she is, and she advised Hagerstown MD. Daisy then advised she was sleeping in the vehicle, and that she was driving to a friends house.  I asked Daisy how much alcohol she consumed recently, and she advised none. I asked Daisy if she took any medications, and she advised none. I then requested Daisy to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests which she complied.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the left shoulder of the roadway in-front of Daisys vehicle. The surface was level and clear from any debris that would hinder Daisyduring these tests. Daisy was positioned in a manner that lights from emergency vehicles would not hinder her during the test. The weather was clear, and calm. The area was well lit with flashlights, and headlights. I asked Daisyif she was on any current medication, and she advised yes. Daisy advised she takes an antidepressant and Asprin. Ialso asked Daisyif she had any physical injuries, and she advised her head hurt from the collision. Daisy also advised her right arm and ankle was hurt.  Glasses/Contacts  Not observed.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Daisyseyes. Daisywas instructed to look straight ahead and follow the tip of my pen with her eyes, without moving her head. I observed Daisyseyes were bloodshot/glossy. Her pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I observed no resting Nystagmus. She was also positioned in a manner to ensure passing vehicles would not interfere with the test.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Observed (NOTE: Daisy would stop following the stimulus. Daisy had to be reminded to follow my previously explained instruction.)  WALK AND TURN 5/8 Next, I explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn test. I instructed Daisy to place her right foot in front of her left foot and stand heel to toe while I provided instructions for the test. She was also instructed to place her arms at her sides. He was advised to remain in the position until instructed to begin the test. Daisy advised she understood.I then explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Daisy was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line, touching heel to toe on every step. Daisy was instructed to keep her hands by her sides, remain focused on her feet, and to count aloud every step. On her ninth step, Daisy was instructed and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps with her rear foot to turn completely around. Daisy was again instructed to complete the second series of steps identical to the first series. I informed Daisy that once the test began that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands by her sides, look down at her feet, and count every step aloud. I then asked Daisy if she understood the instructions, and she advised yes.  Instructional Stage: Nothing observed  Walking Stage (1stNine) -Incorrect number of steps (Daisy conducted ten (10) steps) -Stopped while walking on step ten (10) - Misses heal to toe contact on steps 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (Greater than  inch) - Raises arms for balance (Greater than 6 inches away from side)  Turn: Completed incorrectly (Daisy turned twisting both feet)  Walking Stage (2nd Nine) -Misses heal to toe contact on all nine steps (Greater than  inch) -Stopped while walking on step one (1) -Raises arms for balance (Greater than 6 inches away from side)  ONE LEG STAND (REFUSED) Prior to Daisy performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Daisy was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised, he was to keep her legs straight (slight bend acceptable), watch her raised foot, keep her hands at her sides, to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one-thousand two), and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Daisy if she understood the test. Daisy refused to conduct the test  Daisy refused to submit to a preliminary breath test.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Daisywas driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Eyes bloodshot and glassy  Odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person  Slurred speech  Daisy not knowing where she was  Several open / half empty alcoholic beverages within drivers reach  Failing to control vehicle speed to avoid a collision  A previous lookout for a vehicle matching the Hondas description  My observed signs (clues) of impairment while she performed the Standardized Field Sobriety  I arrested Daisy at approximately 2353 hours. Daisy, and her children were then transported by EMS personnel to Frederick Health Hospital for evaluation. A search of the inside of the vehicle within the drivers reach revealed numerous open/partially full Natural Ice beers. One beer was opened and partially full on the drivers seat of the vehicle. I observed beer spilled inside the center console of the vehicle. I asked Daisy about the beer, and she advised it was from years ago.  BLOOD TEST: REFUSED  Daisy was advised her DR15 advice of rights, and refused to submit to a blood draw at approximately 0040 hours (8/14/23).Kelly Lawson with Frederick County CPS was contacted and informed of the incident involving the juveniles. Kelly assisted Daisy in contacting a family member to assist with the care of the children. Kelly advised a social worker would be following up with Daisy.  DISPOSITION OF DEFENDANT  After the completion of processing, Daisywas given copies of all pertinent paperwork and released to the care of the hospital.  All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
