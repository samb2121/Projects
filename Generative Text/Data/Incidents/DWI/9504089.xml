         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM*  The following incident was captured on in-car camera and body worn camera. Title: DUI 23-040 R. ID: 23-MSP-002366.  Case #: 23-MSP-002366 DUI #: 23-040 (Golden Ring Barrack) Defendant: Liza Mary McCorkle  TRAINING: *I am trained by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. *I am approved by the State of Maryland Office of Chief Medical Examiner and Maryland State Police to conduct preliminary breath tests. *I have successfully completed the Instructor Development Course in Standardized Field Sobriety Testing by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *I have successfully completed and graduated with distinction from the 15th session of the University of Marylands Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies (DUI Institute.) *I have successfully completed the Instructor Development Course in Preliminary Breath Tests by the Maryland State Police. *I have successfully completed the Basic Breath Test Operator Course. *I attended the Impaired Driving Conference, October 2018. *I have successfully completed a 24-hour NHTSA course in Moving/Stationary Doppler RADAR and LIDAR through the Baltimore County Police Department, June 2019. *I have apprehended more than 425 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE ONE):  On January 20, 2023, at approximately 0035 hours, I, Trooper First Class Jackson #6481, was on routine patrol in Maryland State Police unmarked unit DUI-6. While stationary at a steady read traffic signal on Carroll Island Road at Eastern Boulevard, I observed, directly in front of my patrol vehicle, a black Chevrolet Blazer (MD: 9933DA). When the traffic signal cycled green, I observed the operator make a wide left turn onto westbound Eastern Boulevard and continue with half the vehicle in lane #1 and half the vehicle in lane #2.  The operator then positioned the vehicle in lane #1 (left lane.) On two additional occasions, the operator swerved to the right, over the white lane lines and into lane #2 by half the vehicles width. On one occasion the operator swerved to the right, over the white lane lines and into lane #2 by more than the width of the passenger side tires. Based on these observations, I felt the vehicle was being operated in an unsafe manner and needed to be stopped. I activated my emergency lights and observed the operator come to a stop on the right shoulder of westbound Eastern Blvd at MD-43 in Baltimore County, Maryland.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE TWO):  I contacted the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle. I identified myself and the reason for the traffic stop. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within the vehicle. I observed the drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I identified the driver by her Maryland drivers license as Liza Mary McCorkle 2/F 8/26/73. McCorkle appeared to be disoriented and her mouth appeared to be dry.  A female named Valerie called McCorkle while she was searching for the registration card. McCorkle answered the call via the vehicles Bluetooth and Valerie stated, Hey that aint you thats pulled over is it? McCorkle quickly ended the call and continued to search for the registration card. I observed McCorkle pass over the registration card and I pointed it out to her. Throughout my interaction with McCorkle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within the vehicle.  I returned to my patrol vehicle, where I conducted a license check on McCorkle. I deactivated my front emergency lights and made my second approach on the drivers side. I asked McCorkle to exit her vehicle in order to separate her from the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within. McCorkle states, Thats fine. As you see by my plates, I have an obvious disability. Im drinking water. I have to pee really bad. I need to get home.  While outside her vehicle, McCorkle complained about her medical issues and having to pee. I informed McCorkle that I could only offer her to pee roadside. McCorkle initially did not want to pee roadside. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from McCorkles breath and person. McCorkle admitted to consuming two Corona beers prior to driving.  McCorkle stated, What would you like me to perform for you tonight to make you feel satiated. McCorkle stated, I was married to a cop for ten years. I get what youre trying to do tonight, but I just need to get home to pee because Im in horrible pain right now. McCorkle stated, What do you need me to do for you. McCorkle agreed to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE THREE):  I conducted the evaluation on the right shoulder of westbound Eastern Boulevard at MD-43. My patrol flashlight lit the area. The area appeared to be level, wet from earlier rain, and free of any obvious debris. McCorkle appeared to be in good physical condition.  I asked McCorkle the following questions:  Glasses or contact: Reading glasses. Medications: Six different medications including Trazadone. McCorkle stated that she takes the medications in the morning and the evening and she takes the medications as prescribed. Physical and medical conditions: Rheumatoid arthritis, Inner cytial cystitis, migraines and body pain issues.  Prior to testing, McCorkle insisted on needing to pee due to her medical conditions. McCorkle stated, I have to pee because thats going to screw everything up. CPL Wallace #6323 arrived on scene and provided McCorkle with napkins. McCorkle was given the opportunity to urinate roadside. After urinating and prior to testing, I asked McCorkle if she had a jacket she wanted to put on. McCorkle retrieved a jacket from her vehicle. It took McCorkle just over a minute to successfully zip her jacket.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): 6/6 CLUES OBSERVED.  I instructed McCorkle to stand with her heels and toes together. I then properly explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to McCorkle and she stated she understood. I positioned McCorkle in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test. McCorkles pupils were equal in size, resting nystagmus was not present, and her eyes showed equal tracking.  1.) Lack of smooth pursuit- Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes. 4.) Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Not present. NOTE: During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from McCorkles breath.  WALK AND TURN (WAT): 4/8 CLUES OBSERVED.  I instructed McCorkle to stand in the instructional position, with her right foot in front of her left foot, touching heel to toe, in a straight line, with her hands flat down at her sides. I instructed McCorkle to remain in that position until I tell her to begin the test and she stated she understood. I then demonstrated and explained the Walk and Turn to McCorkle in accordance with the NHTSA manual. McCorkle stated that she understood.  Instructional Phase: During the instructional phase, I observed McCorkle lose her balance four times causing her to break her heel to toe stance and step off line.  Walking Stage (1st nine): 1.) McCorkle missed touching heel to toe by three to six inches on steps 3 through 9. 2.) McCorkle stepped off line on steps 4 through 9. 3.) McCorkle raised her arms by more than twelve inches for balance multiple times throughout the test.  While walking, McCorkle stated, Im sucking at it. Im already sucking at it. I suck at it. After completing the first nine steps, McCorkle stated, I suck at it. Just fucking whatever. Whatever dude McCorkle didnt attempt the turn or second series of nine steps.  I explained to McCorkle that we would move onto the next test. McCorkle became emotional and stated, What are doing the tests for, youre just going to fucking arrest me anyway. McCorkle stated, My fucking Husband is a cop I already know the fucking drill. Youre just going to fucking arrest me. Why are you fucking playing with me? McCorkle became aggressive and walked towards me. While sticking her hand in my face McCorkle stated, My Husbands a fucking cop. You understand me my Husbands a fucking cop I get the fucking drill. I told McCorkle to get her hand out of my face and she stated, I get it. Im not trying to fucking assault you.  McCorkle stated, Im not drunk Im buzzed. I just want to go home. I asked McCorkle if she was going to perform the remaining tests and she stated, Alright lets do it. McCorkle then began smoking an electronic cigarette. I asked McCorkle to put the e-cigarette away and she did not listen. McCorkle blew a cloud of smoke from the e-cigarette into my face. While getting McCorkle in position for the One Leg Stand tests, I observed her stumble backwards.  ONE LEG STAND (OLS): UNABLE TO PERFORM.  I instructed McCorkle to stand with her heels and toes together. I then demonstrated and explained the One Leg Stand to McCorkle in accordance with the NHTSA manual.  Instructional Stage: During the instructional stage, I observed McCorkle get emotional and yell out, I cant be at the county fucking intake all night. I cant fucking sit there. McCorkle refused to answer me if she understood the test or had any questions. McCorkle continued to yell out how she cant sit in county intake all night. I asked McCorkle if she was going to do the test. McCorkle raised her right foot, swayed, raised her left arm and put her foot down while stating, Sure Ill stand here and not be able to do it.  McCorkle stated, Even if I wasnt drunk I couldnt balance. I asked McCorkle Even if you werent drunk? and she stated, Even if I werent I couldnt balance. McCorkle stated, Ive had four beers tonight sir. I explained to McCorkle that she previously told me she had two and she stated, Ok so, if Im being honest Ive had four. McCorkle continued to show her inability to balance.  Preliminary Breath Test (PBT):  I offered McCorkle a Preliminary Breath Test, which she agreed. Result: 0.12 BrAC. While awaiting the PBT results, McCorkle admitted to consuming four Corona beers at the Tavern from 8pm to now.  ARREST:  Due to the number of observations, I concluded McCorkle was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0103 hours, I placed McCorkle under arrest for driving while under the influence. Search incident to arrest revealed no contraband on McCorkles person. I placed McCorkle in the front passenger seat per department policy.  I transported McCorkle to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing. While at the Barrack, I provided McCorkle with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. I then played the DR-15 Advice of Rights audio aloud and instructed McCorkle to follow along. At approximately 0140 hours, McCorkle refused to submit to an alcohol concentration test.  INTOXIMETER RESULT:  ****REFUSAL****  I issued McCorkle citations, copies of the DR-15 and the DR-15A. McCorkle remained emotional, irate and uncooperative throughout the incident. McCorkle was released from the Barrack.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
