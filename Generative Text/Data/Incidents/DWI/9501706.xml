My investigation was recorded on AXON digital recording system assigned to G-39 and AXON body camera assigned to M/Tpr Fair. The DRE evaluation was captured on my BWC, Lt.

Minors in Vehicle:NO  PBT: 0.00 BrAC at 0058 hours  EVIDENTIARY TEST:0.00 BrAC at 0221 hours, Refused DRE requested blood test at 0421 hours  DRE (Drug Recognition Expert): Lt. C. Smith, Baltimore PD (ID # J274, DRE ID # 032827)  Weather: clear, approximately 44 degrees Fahrenheit  Qualifications:  -Maryland State Police Academy (June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007)  -I am trained to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through NHTSA and the Maryland State Police (MSP Academy, June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007).  -I have attended and graduated from the University of Maryland University College Advanced DUI College (UMUC January 7-11, 2013).  -Street Narcotics Investigation for Road Patrol (MPCTC, 05/22/2015)  -I have attended and completed training Enhanced DUI Enforcement: The Complete Arrest (MPCTC, 05/11/2016).  -A.R.I.D.E.: Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (MPCTC, 03/29-03/30/2017)  -Cannabis Impairment Detection Workshop (MPCTC, 09/29/2021)  -Preliminary Breath Test Instructor (MSP CTAU, 09/11-09/12/2023)  Driver/ Defendant:  MD DL G-655-546-067-386 LORI ANN GORMAN 15026 HANOVER PIKE UPPERCO, MD 21155 2/F, DOB 05/22/1984  text-decoration:underline"&gt;lorigorman438@gmail.com 443-608-9708  Phase I: Reason for Stop  On 11/06/2023 at approximately 0028 hours I was on duty, in uniform, operating a marked Maryland State Police Patrol vehicle, G-39. I responded to the 7-11 located at 125 Hanover Pike, Hampstead, Carroll County, MD, for a report of a subject passed out/ unconscious in the driver seat in the parking lot. MSP Westminster Dispatch advised the vehicle and driver had been on scene for approximately 2 hours. While I was in route, Officers Vanik and Wilt of Hampstead PD arrived on scene.  Phase II: Contact  Upon my arrival, I made contact with the driver, and Officers Vanik and Wilt in the parking lot of the 7-11, located at 125 Hanover Pike, Hampstead, Carroll County, MD (a level and well-lit parking lot with overhead lighting). The weather was clear, approximately 44 degrees Fahrenheit. The driver advised she had been in an argument with her fiance, drove the vehicle to the 7-11, went to sleep for a little bit, and was awakened by the Hampstead PD officers. Officer Wilt advised he arrived on scene first, observed the vehicles engine was running, keys in the ignition, and driver passed out seated in the drivers seat. Wilt advised the driver did not initially respond to his knocking on the roof, window, or drivers door. The driver is described as a white female w/ brown hair, wearing blue shirt and gray cardigan. Wilt later described the driver as having a 1,000 yard stare when she came to. Officers Vanik and Wilt advised the observed drug paraphernalia in the drivers purse, which was open, located on the front passenger seat. Officers Vanik and Wilt advised the driver was the sole occupant of the vehicle. Upon my arrival the driver was standing outside the vehicle, using a nicotine vape. The driver was identified by her MD DL to be LORI ANN GORMAN. I asked the driver the following questions:  Q. When did you last consume anything that would be considered a Controlled Dangerous Substance, to include (but not be limited to) heroin, marijuana, cocaine, or anything like that? A. About 12 hours ago. The driver then clarified and stated she last used CDS at about 8 am.  Q. What do you normally use? A. Heroin.  Q. How do you normally consume it? A. IV.  Q. Are you wearing any glasses or contacts? A. Yeah, glasses. The driver was not wearing glasses at the time. The driver advised she is nearsighted.  Q. Do you have your glasses with you? A. No. The driver advised she was not wearing contacts, but was still able to see the stimulus as I held it 12-14 inches in front of her face.  Q. Do you have any physical issues that would prevent you from standing on one leg for approximately 30 seconds or walking a straight line heel touching toe? A. No  Q. When was the last time you were arrested or charged with anything? A. I dont even know, its been a long, long, long, long, long, long time. The driver advised it has been several years.  Q. How often do you use? A. Daily.  While speaking with the driver, I made the following observations:  -pupils pinpoint -slow raspy speech -body tremors  I made the decision to administer the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests for the following reasons:  -pupils pinpoint -slow raspy speech -subject was found passed out/ unconscious in the drivers seat of a vehicle, with the engine running -admitting to using CDS (heroin) daily -body tremors  I asked the driver if she would consent to the SFSTs. The driver stated she would.  Phase III: Pre-Arrest Screening  All tests were explained and demonstrated prior to asking the driver to attempt them. The tests were conducted in a flat, well-lit area, free of debris. The driver was wearing sandals with socks, black leggings, blue denim button down shirt, and gray cardigan.  SFSTs:All tests were explained and demonstrated prior to me asking the driver to attempt them.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus:  The drivers eyes displayed equal pupil size (pinpoint), tracking, and reaction. I was able to observe 0 clues out of the 6 potential clues:  Additional observations:  -droopy eyelids -pupils pinpoint -slow raspy speech -body tremors -had to be reminded to keep looking at/ for the stimulus (pen) -slight front to back and side to side sway, approximately  inch  Walk  Turn:  The driver conducted this test with her sandals on. I observed 3 clues out of the potential 8 clues:  -incorrect number of steps: took 8 on first set of steps, not 9 as instructed -missed heel touching toe: 3 times on first set of steps -incorrect turn: lead foot not planted as instructed and demonstrated  Additional observations:  -pupils pinpoint -movements were lethargic -leg/ body tremors  One Leg Stand:  The driver conducted this test with her sandals on. The driver indicated she understood my instructions. The driver stood on her left foot and raised her right. I observed 2 out of the 4 potential clues:  -the driver swayed while balancing: front to side to side during the test approximately 1/2 inch -put foot down during the test: 3 times prior to me stopping the test  Additional observations:  -pupils pinpoint -leg/ body tremors  Additional Tests: A.R.I.D.E.  Lack of Convergence:  The lack of convergence was observed: left eye diverged from center.  Additional observations:  -eyes glassy -pinpoint pupils -body tremors observed  Finger To Nose:  The driver was placed in the instructional position: arms down to their side, heels together, hands in fists with index fingers extended and wrists rotated outward. The driver was instructed, when told to do so, to close their eyes and tilt their head backward. I would then give the command, either right or left, and the driver is to touch the tip of their nose with the tip of their index finger, then immediately bring their arm back down to their side. I provided the following commands: left, right, left, right, right, left.  Observations:  -used pad of finger, not finger tip as instructed and demonstrated -body tremors observed -pupils pinpoint  Modified Romberg:  The driver was placed in the instructional position: arms down to their side and heels together. The driver was instructed when I would tell them to do so, to close their eyes, tilt their head back and estimate the passage of 30 seconds by counting quietly to themselves. After the passage of 30 seconds, the driver was instructed to bring their head down, open their eyes and say done.  Observations:  -during the test, the driver swayed front to back and side to side approximately 1 inch -the driver took 32 seconds (according to the digital recording) to estimate the passage of 30 seconds -body tremors observed  The driver was offered a Preliminary Breath Test, which she submitted to with a result of 0.00 BrAC (took three attempts to provide a valid sample). I made the decision to arrest the driver for DUI. My decision to do so was supported by the following reasons/ observations:  -found asleep/ unconscious/ passed out in the drivers seat of vehicle with engine running -lethargic movements -slow raspy speech -slight swaying throughout SFSTs and ARIDE -body tremors observed throughout contact, SFSTs, and ARIDE -eyelids droopy -pupils pinpoint -observations of W  T, OLS, and FTN  The driver was advised she was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed. The driver was placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. A search incident to arrest was conducted of the vehicle (MD tag 1FH2896). The following items were located and seized:  A. one white rock like substance, suspected CDS: crack cocaine, 0.3 grams, located outer pocket of her purse B. clear plastic baggie containing white rock like substance, suspected CDS: crack cocaine, 2.1 grams, located in her purse C. one pink colored plastic container w/ white rock and powder substance, suspected CDS: crack cocaine, 0.6 grams, located in her purse D. one glass smoking device w/ burnt residue, suspected CDS: crack cocaine, residue/ trace, located in her purse E. three unopened and one opened buprenorphine  naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone) envelopes, suspected CDS: buprenorphine, located in purse F. two plastic vials containing brownish powder substance, suspected CDS: heroin, 3.4 gams, located in her purse G. six pink plastic containers w/ off white powdery substance, suspected CDS: heroin, 3.6 grams, located in her purse H. seven clear gel capsules w/ white powdery substance, suspected CDS: heroine, 1.8 grams, located in her purse I. one metal spoon w/ off white residue, suspected CDS: heroin, residue/ trace, located in her purse J. one white rock like substance, suspected CDS: crack cocaine, 0.3 grams, located in center console ashtray, in front of the gear select/ shifter of the vehicle K. one glass smoking device w/ burnt residue, suspected CDS: crack cocaine, residue/ trace, located in storage compartment to the left of the steering wheel of the vehicle  I know the purse to belong to the driver as her MD medical cannabis card, her PA learners permit, her old PA DL, and her Social Security card were located in a wallet in the purse. I recognized all seized items as CDS and CDS paraphernalia based on my training and experience with the Maryland State Police. The seized items were captured on MSP form 67 and 63 (P-323346) and subsequently submitted to the MSP Westminster Barrack evidence locker in accordance with MSP policy and procedure.  The driver was transported to the MSP Westminster Barrack for further DUI processing. While in route, the driver spoke with a raspy voice, and appeared to nod off. Upon arrival to the MSP Westminster Barrack, the driver was escorted into the DUI processing room by me. The driver was read the DR15 Advice of Rights at 0205 hours, signing it at 0209 hours, submitting to the intoximeter. The intoximeter was administered by Cpl Eyler with a result of 0.00 BrAC per 210 liters of breath at 0221 hours. This result clearly did not correspond with the impairment observed. While the intoximeter was processing the samples, the driver appeared to nod off.  A statewide page was made through the MSP HQ Duty Officer for a Drug Recognition expert at 0228 hours. While waiting for a response to the page, the driver nodded off and nearly fell out of her chair (1 hour 51 minute, 35 second mark on my BWC recording). The driver also was speaking with a slow, raspy voice. Lt Charles Smith of the Baltimore Police Department responded directly to me at 0236 hours, indicating he was available to do the evaluation. I transported the driver to the Central District Precinct building of the Baltimore PD, located at 501 N. Calvert St, Baltimore, MD at approximately 0316 hours. While in route, the driver nodded off again. Lt Smith (ID # J274, DRE ID # 032827) conducted the 12 step NHTSA/ IACP approved drug evaluation of the driver (LORI ANN GORMAN) and found her to be under the influence of a narcotic analgesic and a central nervous system stimulant, impaired, and unable to operate a vehicle safely (DRE Evaluation captured on both Lt. Smiths and my BWCs). When requested to submit a sample of blood for analysis, the driver refused. The driver was issued the DR15(s), MSP Form 33, DR15A, Notice to Appear, Notice of Right to Counsel, criminal citations for the CDS charges, and traffic citations MDR0DJH-MDW0DJH. The driver was transported to her residence. While in route to her residence, the driver nodded off. The driver was advised not to drive from 12 hours from the time of arrest.  Case closed on arrest.  The traffic stop, SFSTs, and intoximeter occurred in Carroll County, MD. The DRE evaluation occurred in Baltimore City, MD.</NarrativeText>
