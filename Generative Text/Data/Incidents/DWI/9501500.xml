Defendant: Nelson Edenilson Quiterio Baires Date of Birth: 04/02/1999 Date of Arrest: 10/08/2023 Time of Arrest: 0355 hours VA Soundex: B65357691 DUI #: 23-219 (Rockville) * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Certified by NHTSA to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) * Certified as a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator  * Certified in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE)  * Attended the 2021 Maryland Impaired Driving Conference in Ocean City, Maryland * Participated in several DUI Special Assignments * DUI Award Recipient for 2021  2022. * Gaithersburg Germantown Chamber of Commerce Award Recipient 2023 * Since 2020 have made over 120 DUI arrest VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Sunday, October 1st, 2023 at approximately 0335 hours, I, Trooper First Class Canizalez #7087 was traveling on northbound I-270 in the area North of Montrose Road when I observed a silver Kia Optima bearing Virginia Registration TZL6532 failing to maintain lane integrity. The vehicle was seen traveling in lane 3 and crossed the broken white lines with both sides of the vehicle. The first time was with  of the vehicles right side from lane 3 into lane 2. And the second time was with  of the vehicles left side from lane 3 into 4. I initiated my lights and sirens to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle and stopped on the right shoulder of northbound I-270 just North of Montrose Road.  CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the vehicle to contact the driver on his driver side. Upon my approach I introduced myself and advised the driver the reason for the stop and asked for his license. The driver was identified by his Virginia Drivers License as: QUITERIO BAIRES, Nelson Edenilson. (VA SDX: B65357691, H/M, DOB 04/02/1999). I questioned the driver on his travels and he advised he was coming from a friends house and was headed home. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage from within the vehicle. I had the driver step out for further questioning in attempts to separate him from his vehicle. While speaking to QUITERIO BAIRES from outside his vehicle, I continued to detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath even with traffic passing. QUITERIO BAIRES was also displaying other signs of impairment such as bloodshot and glassy eyes. When asked about consuming any alcoholic beverages he stated he had consumed 1 Corona beer bottle approximately 2 hours prior to driving. I asked QUITERIO BAIRES if he was willing to perform voluntary SFSTs and he advised that he would.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of northbound I-270 in the area North of Montrose Road. (pavement). The surface was dry and clear from any debris. The weather was clear and light conditions consisted of my flashlight. QUITERIO BAIRES was not displaying any visible injuries. Prior to beginning the test, I asked QUITERIO BAIRES the following questions: Glasses or Contacts: None. Medical Conditions: None. Injuries: None. Medications: None.  *TEST #1 HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): 6/6 The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches, slightly above eye level. I instructed his to look straight ahead, keeping his head stationary while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. I asked QUITERIO BAIRES if he understood the test and he stated Yes. QUITERIO BAIRES pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Vertical Gaze Nystagmus: Present in both eyes.   *TEST #2 WALK AND TURN (WAT): 7/8 Prior to QUITERIO BAIRES performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. QUITERIO BAIRES was instructed to place his left foot on a straight imaginary line then place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. QUITERIO BAIRES was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin the test. QUITERIO BAIRES was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. QUITERIO BAIRES was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, QUITERIO BAIRES was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. QUITERIO BAIRES was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. QUITERIO BAIRES was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked QUITERIO BAIRES if he understood the test and he stated, Yes.     margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES was unable to maintain his balance during the instructional phase.   margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES began the test prior to being instructed to do so.   margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES stepped off line at the 6th step during his first set.    margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES stopped walking at his 16th step taken and was reminded about the turn.    margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES missed heel-to-toe on his 4th and 8th step taken during his first set.    margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES took the incorrect number of steps and took 16 steps on his first set and 10 on his second set.   margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES failed to complete the turn on the instructed planted lead foot.   *TEST #3 ONE LEG STAND (OLS): 2/4 Prior to performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. QUITERIO BAIRES was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count aloud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. QUITERIO BAIRES was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes. QUITERIO BAIRES performed this test balanced on his left foot.     margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES put his foot down at the 4th and 16th second mark.    margin-left:8px"&gt;QUITERIO BAIRES swayed to the right at the 29th second mark.  I offered QUITERIO BAIRES a preliminary breath test and he refused to take it.  PBT Results: Refusal.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe QUITERIO BAIRES was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of an alcoholic beverage: * QUITERIO BAIRES failed to maintain lane integrity on two separate occasions.  * Blood shot and glassy eyes. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from LOPAKA SHAKOs breath. * QUITERIO BAIRES admitting to have consumed one Corona beer bottle approximately 2 hours prior to driving.  Due to a number of observations, I had reason to believe QUITERIO BAIRES was driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and was unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0355 hours, I placed QUITERIO BAIRES under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol. A preliminary search of QUITERIO BAIRES was conducted on the scene and it revealed that he had nothing on his person. QUITERIO BAIRES was then transported to the MSP Rockville Barrack per departmental policy. While conducting the secondary search on QUITERIO BAIRES at the barrack, his oral cavity was checked and was clear and had nothing in his mouth. During the 20-minute observation period, QUITERIO BAIRES remained in my custody and did not introduce any foreign object in his mouth. The DR-15 Advice of Rights form was read to QUITERIO BAIRES at 0420 hours to which he advised he refused to submit to the intoximeter test. INTOXIMETER RESULT  REFUSAL QUITERIO BAIRES was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was taken to his residence at 0455 hours.  Case status: closed by arrest. All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
