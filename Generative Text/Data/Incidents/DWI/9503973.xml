         <NarrativeText>In-car camera operational, T-6. BWC utilized.  Defendant: Nicole Lynn Woodburn Soundex #/State: W-316-630-564-856/Maryland Date of Birth: 11/07/1986 Date of Arrest: 01/29/2023 Time of Arrest: 0228 Hours DUI #23-013  Narrative:   On January 29, 2023 at approximately 0220 hours, I, TFC Engleman #7197 along with Tpr. Pettyjohn #7329 were operating my unmarked patrol vehicle traveling southbound on Mervell Dean Road approaching Tom Hodges Drive, Hollywood, St. Marys County, Maryland 20636. At that time, I observed a black Jeep SUV traveling in front of make a left turn onto Tom Hodges Drive. While the vehicle was completing the turn, I observed it to have an inoperable tag light.   Tpr. Pettyjohn who was operating my patrol vehicle under my supervision as his field training officer, activated his emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle came to a stop on St. Johns Road at MD RT 235 (Three Notch Road), Hollywood, St. Marys County, Maryland 20636. Tpr. Pettyjohn made contact with the vehicles operator who was identified as Nicole Lynn Woodburn (W/F DOB: 11/07/1986) by her Maryland drivers license. During the course of the investigation, Tpr. Pettyjohn learned Woodburn had previously consumed alcoholic beverage prior to driving. Tpr. Pettyjohn conducted standardized field sobriety tests on Woodburn under my supervision. For results of the tests, see Tpr. Pettyjohns supplemental report.   After completing the standardized field sobriety tests, I asked Woodburn if she would consent to a preliminary breath test. Woodburn consented to taking the preliminary breath test. The result was 0.09 BrAC. Tpr. Pettyjohn then placed Wooburn under arrest for Driving Under the Influence. Woodburn was transported to the Leonardtown Barrack for processing and later released to a sober driver. See Tpr. Pettyjohns supplemental report for arrest disposition and processing.  Case closed by arrest.  All of the above events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

I then followed the vehicle onto northbound MD RT. 235 (Three Notch Road) activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle on MD RT. 235 at St. Johns Road, Hollywood, St. Marys County, Maryland 20636.  Personal Contact (Phase 2):   I made contact with the driver of the vehicle via the drivers side window. The driver was identified as Nicole Lynn Woodburn (W/F DOB: 11/07/1986) by her Maryland drivers license. I advised the driver she was stopped for the vehicles tag light being inoperative. I overserved the drivers speech to be slurred while speaking with me, glassy eyes, and a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath. I asked Woodburn where she was coming from and she stated, I met up with some family at Toots. I asked Woodburn how much she had to drink tonight and she stated, 4 beers but I havent had anything for 2 hours. I then gathered the remainder of Woodburns information and asked her to exit her vehicle, to which she complied. I then asked if Woodburn if she would be willing to conducted standardized field sobriety tests to which she consented. The results are as follows.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3):   The evaluation was performed on the side of the road, in front of Woodburns vehicle. The surface was dry, level, and free from any debris or obstruction. Lighting conditions consisted of my headlamps, spotlight, and Woodburns headlamps, and with my front emergency lights deactivated. Woodburn appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, limps, or limb ailments. (Reference below for more information regarding any medical history or injuries). I asked Woodburn the following questions:   Contacts or eyeglasses: Nothing to report.  Medications: Woodburn stated she takes medication for anxiety.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Medical conditions or injuries which would inhabit her ability to walk in a straight line or stand on one foot: Woodburn stated she has a stigmatism in her left eye and a bad weakness in her right leg due stabbing herself previously.    It should be noted, while speaking with Woodburn outside of the vehicle I detected a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed)    The first test was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The black tip of my pen was used as a stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Woodburns face. She was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the black tip of the pen with her eyes until told to stop. Woodburns pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed. She was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Woodburn if she understood the instructions and she stated, Um-Humm.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes   margin-left:8px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degree  Present in both eyes  *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not present  Walk and Turn  (6/8 clues observed)   Prior to Woodburn performing the test, I asked Woodburn if she would like to remove her shoes and she stated, No, they should be fine. I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Woodburn was instructed to place her feet together and place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe and imagine a straight line in front of her. Woodburn was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her sides and to remain in this position until told to begin. Woodburn was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. Woodburn was advised to keep her hands flat at her hands flat on her sides, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and count every step out aloud. On the ninth step Woodburn was explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line and take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around. Woodburn was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Woodburn was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her sides, look down at her feet, and count each step aloud. I then began showing Woodburn how to properly walk and she began the test without being instructed to do so.  Instructional Stage:   After being instructed the starting position, Woodburn started the test without being instructed to do so.  Walking Stage (1st Nine Steps): It should be noted, Woodburn began the test without being told to do so and then stopped to remove her shoes to be more comfortable.    Steps of line on step seven (7).  Missed heel to toe greater than one half () an inch on step seven (7).  Stops walking on step nine (9).   margin-left:8px"&gt;Raises arms greater than six (6) inches on all steps taken.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine Steps):    Incorrect number of steps eight (8) steps taken  Missed heel to toe greater than one half () an inch on eight (8) steps taken   margin-left:8px"&gt;Raises arms for balance greater than six (6) inches on all eight (8) steps taken.  Turn:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing to report   It should be noted, prior to completing the turn, Woodburn stopped walking after the first nine (9) and then began walking backwards and stopped. Woodburn then retreated back into the position she stopped in and stated she did not know what she was supposed to do. I instructed Woodburn to turn around and walk back the same way she came. Woodburn completed the turn and then began walking backwards before I stopped her. Woodburn then completed eight (8) steps as mentioned above.  One Leg Stand (1/4 clues observed)   Prior to Woodburn performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Woodburn was instructed to stand with her legs together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, she was to raise to foot of her choice off the ground approximately six (6) inches. While her leg was raised she was to keep her leg straight, keep her hands at her sides, watch her raised foot, to count out loud by thousands (one thousand  one, one thousand two), and continue the test until told to stop. I asked Woodburn if she understood the test and she stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing to Report  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Raises arms for balance great than six (6) inches  Seconds 10-20:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Raises arms for balance great than six (6) inches  Seconds 20-30:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Raises arms for balance great than six (6) inches  Arrest:   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Woodburn was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Moderate odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath  Eyes glassy  My observed clues of impairment while she performed field sobriety tests   I arrested Woodburn for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0228 hours. I then secured Woodburn in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle (T-6), seat belted her normally, and transported her to the Leonardtown Barrack for processing. Woodburn did not place any items in her mouth or remove anything from her mouth. A mouth check was conducted at 0227 hours. A piece of gum was located inside her mouth and Woodburn was asked to spit the gum out and she complied. After arriving at the barrack, I gave Woodburn a copy of the DR-15, Advice of Rights, in English to review. I also played the English version of the DR-15, Advice of Rights, via the MVA website. After Woodburn reviewed the DR-15, Advice of Rights, she signed refusing to submit to the intoximeter test.   All copies of the paperwork were completed and given to Woodburn for her records. Woodburn was released to a sober driver, from the Leonardtown Barrack. Charges:   Blankenship was charged with the following citations:    Driving while under the influence of alcohol (3GLOVNP)  Driving while impaired by alcohol (3GM0VNP)  Negligent driving (3GNOVNP)  Reckless driving (3GP0VNP)  Driving vehicle without rear registration plate illumination (3GQ0VNP)  Case closed by arrest.
