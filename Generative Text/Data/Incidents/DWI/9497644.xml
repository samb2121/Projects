         <NarrativeText>THE EVENT WAS AUDIBLY AND VISUALLY RECORDED VIA BODYWORN CAMERA AND IN-CAR CAMERA  Defendant: Thompson, Charles,Edward  Date of Birth: 02/20/1986  Date of Arrest: 04/02/2023  Time of Arrest: 0408 hours  DUI#: 23-038  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES  Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police. Trained and Certified in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On 04/02/2023 at 0333 hours, I, Tpr. Passwaters #7367 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack was operating marked Maryland State Police unit S-6. At that time, I was traveling on northbound U.S. Route 301 north of Del Rhodes Avenue when I observed a vehicles headlights off the roadway on the southbound side. The vehicle was approximately 50 yards into the field and appeared to be stuck in a ditch.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  As I began walking out to the vehicle I observed it to be a red GMC Yukon bearing temporary Maryland registration T1265087. The GMC appeared to be stuck in a drainage ditch alongside a grassy farm lane that extends off of Clay Drive and runs parallel to U.S. Route 301. I approached the GMC and observed it to be occupied two times, one black male in the drivers seat, and another in the passenger seat. The GMC was still running.  I asked the driver What happened? he replied We were trying to get out of this ditch and trying to turn around. I asked Why dont you try to get out. the driver replied Weve been trying to! I responded No, I mean get out of the car. Both occupants exited the vehicle. I asked the driver and passenger for their drivers licenses. The driver displayed a District of Columbia drivers license 4915293 on their cellphone and was identified as Charles Edward Thompson Jr (#1/M DOB:02/20/1986). The passenger handed me his North Carolina ID card 000049944662 and was identified as Antwine Orlando Arnez Johnson Jr (#1/M DOB:08/22/1990).  I asked Thompson where were you coming from? he replied DC, but were trying to get back on the main road. Thompson advised me that he ran out of gas so AAA towed his truck to the Royal Farms. Thompson advised that he was trying to get back onto U.S. Route 301 and thought Clay Drive would get him there. Clay attempted to turn around on the farm lane and got stuck in the drainage ditch.  I then asked them where they were coming from prior to Royal Farms and Johnson stated that they were coming from Delmar and were trying to get back to District of Columbia. I asked them Have you had anything to drink tonight and they replied No.  I then separated Thompson from Johnson. When asked where he was coming from again, Thompson stated The other side of town, trying to get back to DC.  I asked Thompson to perform a Standardized Field Sobriety Test to confirm that he was okay to drive and he agreed.  PRE ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the grassy farm lane running parallel with southbound U.S. 301 north of Del Rhodes Avenue. The surface was wet, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight and vehicles spotlight. Thompson was positioned in a manner so that passing traffic would not affect the test results. Thompson appeared to be in good physical condition.  I asked Thompson the following questions:  Glasses or contacts - None  Medical conditions - None  Physical injuries - None  Thompson performed the test in white sneakers  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. It was held approximately 12-15 inches from Thompsons eyes, slightly above eye level. Thompson was instructed to follow the tip of the stimulus with only his eyes. Thompsons pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.  I instructed Thompson to put his heels and toes together for the HGN test. Thompson just stared at me and did not move. I repeated my instructions and Thompson complied. I re-explained the test and asked Thompson if he understood to which he replied Yes.  I held the up the stimulus and Thompson was not looking at it. I repeated the instructions and asked Do you understand? to which he shrugged and said Yes. While checking for lack of smooth pursuit and equal tracking, Thompson immediately began moving his head left and right to follow the stimulus instead of using only his eyes. I then repeated the instructions.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  The wind changed direction and was blowing directly towards Thompsons face. I stepped behind Thompson and told him to Face this way. so that he would not be facing the wind. Thompson stood still and stared in the opposite direction. I tapped his shoulder and told him to turn around to which he finally complied. While standing directly in front of Thompson, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath.  While attempting to check for distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, Thompson kept moving his head to the left and right in order to follow the stimulus. Once again, I instructed him to keep his head still. Thompson was not able to keep his head still.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  RESTING NYSTAGMUS NOT PRESENT. VERTICAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS NOT PRESENT  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Thompson was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary straight line. Thompson was then instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and remain in that position until told to begin. Thompson was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. On the ninth step, he was instructed to keep his lead foot on the line, and take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. After the turn, Thompson was instructed to complete the second series of nine (9) steps in the same heel to toe fashion.  Instructional Stage:  Thompson could not properly get into the starting position. Instead of facing towards me while I showed him the starting position, he would turn to his left and face the same direction I was facing. Thompson could not continue with walking stage of the test while facing that direction so I repeatedly had to instruct him to face towards me. Thompson needed to be corrected five times.  Thompson placed his left foot in front of his right foot. Once again, I instructed him to place his right foot in front of his left foot.  Cannot Keep Balance - Thompson put his right foot in front of his left foot and immediately moved his right foot to his right in an attempt to stay upright.  Prior to beginning the walking stage, Thompson stated Can my friend drive? I replied No, he doesnt have a license.  Walking Stage (First Nine Steps):  Misses heel-toe - (Steps 1 through 13) Thompson missed his heel to toe by more than one half inch on every step he took.  Steps off line - (Steps 8 and 9) Thompson stepped more than his foot width off line on step 8 with his left foot and step 9 with his right foot.  Raises arms - Thompsons arms were raised approximately 6 to 10 inches from his sides during the entirety of his walking stage.  Actual number steps - Thompson failed to follow my instructions and took 13 steps before his turn.  Improper Turn: Thompson failed to follow my instructions and performed an improper turn. Thompson stepped out with his right foot and picked up his left foot and turned completely around rather than keeping his lead foot planted.  Walking Stage (Second Nine Steps):  Thompson performed an improper turn, stopped taking the test, and looked at me.  I then decided to take Thompson up to the shoulder of southbound U.S. Route 301 to retake the walk and turn test.  While on the shoulder, I re-explained the test once again. Thompson cut me off while I was explaining it to him and said I understand the test, I am a special police officer, corrections in DC. I just wanted to make that known. I asked Thompson to resume with the test and he said I already took this test, sir.  After explaining the test I told Thompson to begin when he was ready. Thompson stood there staring at the road. I asked Thompson Are you not gonna do it? Thompson said Of course! I didnt deny I was gonna do the test. I asked Thompson if I needed to re-explain the test and he replied No. I said Go ahead. Thompson then said Whats the test? I re-explained the test and Thompson had still had no idea how to do the test so I moved onto the one leg stand test.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Thompson was instructed to stand with his heels together and his hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand one, one-thousand two, etc.) and to not put his foot down until the end of the test. I asked Thompson if he understood the test and he confirmed. Thompson balanced on his right foot for the test.  Seconds 1-10:  Puts foot down (2 times)  Seconds 11-20:  Puts foot down (1 time)  Raises arms - Thompson raised his arms approximately 12 inches from his body in an attempt to balance himself.  While on scene, I informed Thompson of his Preliminary Breath Rights. Thompson was offered a PBT, to which he refused. Thompson stated he just wanted to go home.  Based on the totality of circumstances, I concluded Thompson was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  -Slurred speech  -Odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Thompsons breath and person  -Thompsons inability to obey designated lane directions and traveling off of the roadway into a field  -Thompsons inability to comprehend simple instructions  -Clues during Field Sobriety Testing: HGN (6/6), WAT (6/8), OLS (2/4).  On 04/02/2023, at approximately 0408 hours, I placed Thompson under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I immediately notified the barrack. A search incident to arrest of Thompsons person was conducted. The search of Thompsons person was negative.  Thompson was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights in English. At approximately 0445 hours, Thompson agreed to take an alcohol concentration test.  The test was conducted by Cpl.Turpin #5117 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Thompson refused to blow an adequate amount of air into the intoximeter and his test was counted as a refusal.  The vehicle was towed by Parks Tire and Auto Center  At 0606 hours, Thompson was transported to the Queen Annes County Commissioners Office and was held without bond.  At 0719 hours, I transported Thompson to the Queen Annes County Detention Center.  He was issued the following citations:  Citations:  TA 21-902(a)(1)(i) Driving vehicle while under the influence of alcohol TA 21-902(b)(1)(i) Driving vehicle while impaired by alcohol TA 21-901.1(b) Negligent driving vehicle in careless and imprudent manner endangering property, life and person TA 21-901.1(a) Reckless driving vehicle in wanton and willful disregard for safety of persons and property TA 21-309(d) Driver failure to obey designated lane directions TA 21-801(b) Failure to control vehicle speed on highway in order to avoid a collision.  The defendant was issued copies of the following documents:  -Citations (listed above) -DR-15 Advice of Rights -DR-15a Order of Suspension -MSP 033  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
