         <NarrativeText>DUI Case # 23-MSP-012421  TRAINING:  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TEST TRAINED ADVANCED ROADSIDE IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT  DEFENDANT:  Timothy Raymond Siple DOB: 05/16/1984 232 Biddle Street, Chesapeake City, MD 21915  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion  On April 7, 2023, at 1806 hours, I, Trooper Williams #7381 of the Maryland State Police was on stationary patrol on Pulaski Highway prior to Rt. 279 when I was dispatched for a possible intoxicated driver. I attempted to located the driver the last location give was west bound Pulaski Highway at Rt. 272. Trooper First Class Roland of the Maryland State Police # 6698 was able to observe the vehicle in motion and stopped the driver at east bound Pulaski Highway at Principio Parkway, North East, Maryland on the right hand shoulder.   Phase # 2 - Personal Contact  TFC. Roland had already made contact and identified the driver prior to my arrival. I observed a white GMC work van bearing Maryland registration plate 5FE4330. I observed the keys in the ignition, the driver was sitting in the driver seat wearing a blue tank top and sunglasses and appeared to be crying. I asked the driver if he was ok, the driver stated No. While speaking with the driver I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and I observed open bottles of alcoholic beverages in the passenger seat of the car. While I was speaking with the driver TFC Roland was confirming the identity of the driver via his Maryland Drivers license as Timothy Raymond Siple, DOB: 05/16/1984, 2/M. A METER/NCIC check was conducted on the driver the search revealed Siple had a warrant for his arrest for violating a protection order. During this time I requested Siple to exit the vehicle, as Siple was exiting the vehicle I observed his movement was slow and delayed I also observed a small bottle of moonshine on the driver side door. While walking behind the driver the odor of the alcohol became amplified. While watching Siple walk I observed that he couldnt walk without walking into the vehicle. Once at the front of the vehicle Siple was leaning forward appearing to having difficulty standing straight up. I attempted to talk to Siple to find out what caused the series of events that occurred and he started yelling at me stating ALL YOU DO IS LISTEN TO THE FUCKING BITCHES. Siple then started walking towards the roadway and I had to stop him from potentially walking into traffic. TFC Roland attempted to block Siple from walking and Siple yelled DONT FUCKING TOUCH ME at TFC Roland. I asked Siple if he would be willing to submit to field sobriety test Siple advised yes.   Phase # 3 - Pre-Arrest Screening  I began conversing with Siple about her Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and asked her the following questions: Do you have any injuries I need to be made aware of? No. Glasses/Contacts: No. Do you take any medication? No. I am trained by the Maryland State Police in performing Standard Field Sobriety Tests. The test was performed on the shoulder of the roadway the ground was free of debris and the surface was level.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus - 6 of 6 clues  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Siples eyes and slightly above his eye level. Siple was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while focusing on and following the stimulus with his eyes, and his eyes only, and keep his hands down at his side until told to stop. Siple pupils were equal in size and displayed equal tracking. Siple was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. While I moved the stimulus, Siple had to be reminded not to turn or move his head he moved his head (4) times. 1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Before 45 Degrees - Present.  Walk and Turn - 5 of 8 clues  Before Siple performed the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Siple was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot, touch heel to toe, and place his hands down at his side. She was instructed to stand in this manner until told to begin. Siple was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching hell to toe on each step. Siple was advised to keep his hands down at his side, keep his eyes focused on his lead foot on the ground and take a series of small steps around her foot that was pivoted while turning. Siple was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Siple was told once he began the test not to stop and to walk until the test was completed, to keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. After stating that he understood the instructions and had no questions about the test then the test was administered.  *INSTRUCTIONAL PHASE*  Walking Stage (1st nine): Raised arms (during all steps), walked off line, missed heel to toe, stopped during the first nine steps. Walking Stage (2nd nine): Raised arms, walks off line, missed heel to toe. Turn: Completed satisfactorily. *Additional Observation* During the Walk and Turn failed to remain in the starting position.   One Leg Stand - 3 of 4 clues Before Siple performed the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Siple was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his legs straight, look at his raised foot, count out loud by thousands (one thousand one, one thousand two), and continue the test until told to stop. After he indicated understanding the instructions, the test was administered.  *INSTRUCTIONAL PHASE* Hops: 1 time Lifts arms: 3 time Sways: 1 times  PRELIMINARY BREATH TESTS PBT was refused.  ARREST:  Because of the above observations, Siple was unable to operate a vehicle safely and he was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 1827 hours. It was confirmed by the PCO that Siple had a warrant for his arrest for violating a protection order. Siple was taken to the barracks and a secondary search was conducted. At the barrack Siple was provided a copy and read the DR 15 Advice of Rights Form. Siple refused to submit to the Alcohol Concentration Test at 1850 hours.  Intoximeter Results: N/A  Siple was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol while operating a vehicle. Siple was then taken to Cecil County Commissioners Office for his warrant. Siple was ultimately held without bond at Cecil County Detention Center  At this time, I request the case be closed.  All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On April 7, 2023 at approximately 1800 hours, the North East Barrack dispatched a lookout for a possible intoxicated driver who was traveling westbound on Pulaski Highway in the area of North East Road. The suspect vehicle was described as a white work van with ladders on the roof bearing Maryland registration 5FE4330. I, TFC Roland of the Maryland State Police, observed the vehicle and followed the vehicle for approximately half of a mile. The vehicle was traveling in lane one and was swerving. The vehicle swerved significantly into lane two so far that vehicle was positioned directly over the dotted white lane dividers and half of the vehicle was in lane one while the other half was in lane two. The vehicle then swerved to the left and drove on the solid yellow line which separates lane one from the grass median. The vehicle continuously swerved while I was behind it. The vehicle would sometimes gradually swerve and then other times it would swerve abruptly. After I was behind the vehicle it made a u-turn at the next available crossover which was at Principio Pkwy W. The vehicle was conducting the u-turn and ran over the lane divider curb with the front and rear tires which divides the turn lane from eastbound Pulaski Highway. I initiated a traffic stop and the vehicle pulled onto the right shoulder and stopped. I made contact with the driver and he was identified as Timothy Siple (DOB: 5/16/1984). Siple was unusually emotional and his movements were exaggerated. I observed several mini alcoholic beverage containers on the passenger seat which Siple attempted to conceal with clothing. Trooper Williams then arrived on scene and conducted Standardized Field Sobriety Testing (SFST).  While Trooper Williams was conducting SFST we were advised Siple had an active warrant for his arrest. Siple was belligerent and hostile throughout SFST, and due to his behavior I requested an additional unit to assist.  Siple was arrested and placed in handcuffs. Trooper Williams escorted Siple towards Trooper Williams patrol vehicle and Siple began flexing his muscles and stiffening his arms. I requested a caged patrol vehicle to respond to our location. Siple continued to be angry and agitated and began aggressively pulling away from Trooper Williams yelling, Fuck you!  I immediately gained control of Siples right arm while Trooper Williams maintained custody of Siples left arm to prevent his escape and prevent him from injuring himself or anyone else. I attempted to deescalate Siple by requesting him multiple times to stop and requested him to chill out. Siple failed to comply and continued to aggressively pull his arms away and twist his body to break our grip on his arms. Trooper Williams and I were able to maintain custody of Siple. It was apparent Siple was not going to cooperate and he continued to be aggressive. For the safety of everyone involved and to minimize risk of injury we escorted Siple away from the paved highway and onto the grass next to the shoulder of the roadway.  I requested Siple to sit down multiple times and he refused to comply. Siple continued to tense his muscles and not comply. I placed my leg behind Siples legs and attempted to escort him to a sitting position on the ground. My attempt to sit Siple on the ground was not effective because Siple did not comply and remained standing. I then executed a successful leg sweep and maintained control of Siple as we both went to the ground. Siple was placed on his side and we remained in this position until a caged patrol vehicle arrived on scene and at that time Siple was placed in the caged patrol vehicle and transported to the barrack.  At the barrack Siple continued to be uncooperative, belligerent, and hostile. Siple was using his body to push us away while a secondary search was being conducted and three Troopers had to maintain control of Siple so that a complete and thorough search could be conducted. Once Siple was placed in the cell his malice behavior continued.  A use of force report was completed in Blue Team.  All events occurred in Cecil County Maryland. </NarrativeText>
