         <NarrativeText>Sgt. Natale # 5455  Body Worn Camera  On/Activated  P-6 is equipped with MVR.  PHASE ONE-VEHICLE IN MOTION-  On Sunday, November 5,2023 at approximately 0055 hours, I, Sgt. Natale # 5455 was stationary with my emergency equipment activated (lights only) at a motor vehicle collision in lane # 2 with two (2) flares behind my unmarked MSP vehicle (P-6) in the area of S/B MD-295 N/O MD-100, Anne Arundel County, MD. I observed in my rear-view mirror a dark-colored sedan slowly approaching the rear of my MSP vehicle. I observed the dark-colored sedan drive over the one (1) flare closest to the dotted white line and continued slowly moving toward the rear of my MSP vehicle. At this time, I got out of my MSP vehicle to try to stop the vehicle from striking the rear of my MSP vehicle.  PHASE TWO-PERSONAL CONTACT-  I approached the dark-colored sedan on the drivers side and was able to get the driver to stop the vehicle approximately 10-15 feet from my MSP vehicle. I observed the sole occupant, which was the driver. Icontacted the driver.I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the drivers breath and person.  I asked the driver about how many alcoholic beverages did she drink? The driver eventually admitted to having one (1) drink. Her eyes were glassy and speech was slurred. I asked the driver for her DL and registration. Her movements were slow, while trying to locate her DL in her purse. The driver eventually provided me with the correct DL. The driver was identified by her MarylandDL as Shereatta Maria White a B/F DOB 10/23/1982. The vehicle White was driving was a black Chevrolet Malibu with Michigan registration EST9725.  PHASE THREE-PRE ARREST SCREENING-  Due to my observations with White, I asked her to step out of the vehicle to make sure she was safe to drive tonight. White agreed. Whites movement were slow getting out of the vehicle. I instructed her to put on both her sandals, instead of the one (1) high heel boot she had on. This would be safer for White during SFST. While speaking to White at the rear of my MSP vehicle, I continued to smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. White admitted to drinking wine. I had White stand in front of my MSP vehicle. I turned the front emergency lights off.  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS:  The following field sobriety tests were conducted on a flat level surface free from debris.White was not wearing glasses during the test.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS:  Instructions: The subject is told to stand with their feet together and their arms at their side. A stimulus (an ink pen) is held approximately twelve to fifteen inches in front of them at eye level. They are instructed to keep their head still and to follow the stimulus with their eyes. Prior to beginning I ask if they understand the instructions. I initially check for equal pupil size. I next check for a lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. White understood the directions. I had to remind White two (2) times to follow the stimulus only with her eyes and not her head.  Results: 6/6 clues observed in both eyes  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  None.  WALK AND TURN:  Instructions: The defendant is told to stand with the right foot in front of their left foot in a heel to toe manner. They are told to keep their arms at their side and to not begin the test until told to do so. I then explain and demonstrate the test. The defendant is instructed to take nine heel to toe steps up the solid white line. On the ninth step they are told to leave their lead foot in place and perform a 180 degree turn by taking several small steps, pivoting on their lead foot. They are then told to take an additional nine heel to toe steps back down the solid white line. They are told to keep their hands at their sides during the test. I then ask if they understand the instructions. White understood the directions.  Results:  (1) White during the instructional phase lost balance three (3) times. (2) White during the instructional stage started to soon two (2) times. (3) White missed heel to toe on the first nine (9). (4)White stepped off the lineon the first nine (9). (5) White stopped walking on the first nine (9). (6) White took the incorrect number of steps on the first nine (9). A total of 16 steps. (7) White did not complete the turn as instructed.   After the incorrect turn she just slowly walked back with a stumble and did not complete the second nine (9) steps and asked if am I good.  7/8 clues observed.  ONE LEG STAND:  Instructions: The defendant is instructed to stand with their feet together with their arms at their side while I explain and demonstrate the test. They are told to raise either foot of their choice approximately six inches off the ground, pointing their toe out so their foot is level with the ground. They are then told to begin to count, one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two, one-thousand-three, etc. They are told to continue counting until I tell them to stop. They are told to watch their feet, to count out loud, to keep their arms at their side, and to not put their foot down. White understood the directions.  Results:  0-10 seconds  White put her foot down three (3) times. 10-20 seconds  White put her down four (4) times, 20-30 seconds  White put her foot down one (1) time and then swayed and fell over to the ground.  2/4 clues observed.  *Note  White did not maintain her hands down at her side as instructed.  White was not offered a preliminary breath test (PBT).  ARREST:  Due to my observations, at approximately 0105 hours, I placed White under arrest for driving under the influence.White was transported back to the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for processing. White was provided with a DR-15 to read/follow along. White understood her Advice of Rights. White agreed to submit to an alcohol concentration test. Sgt.Smith # 5414 of the Maryland State Police gave the test to White. Sgt. Smith is certified to operate the Intoximeter at the Glen Burnie Barrack (serial # 011778).The result: .29 at 0105 hours.  *Note  The times are correct due to Daylight Savings Time ending.
