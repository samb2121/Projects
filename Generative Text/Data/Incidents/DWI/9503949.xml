         <NarrativeText>INCIDENT: DUI/DWI  SUSPECT: Camryn Blaire Phillips DOB: 12/15/2000 ADDRESS: 332 N Washington St. Easton, MD 21601 PRIORS: None known  SCENE PROCESSING: Incident captured onBWCandIn Car camera. Picture taken and uploaded to VeriPIc.  NARRATIVE:  On February 21, 2023 at approximately 0313 hours, I, TFC. S. Glover #6819 was dispatched to the area of 12607 Ocean Gateway for the report of a single vehicle in a ditch. I responded to the scene and observed a light blue Volkswagon minivan bearing Maryland registration 7FB0984 in the ditch at that location. I made contact with the driver who was located in the drivers seat. I observed that the key was in the vehicle and the vehicle was running. Additionally, I observed that there were 2 juveniles in the middle row of the minivan. The driver identified herself as Camryn Blaire Phillips (12/15/2000) W/F by her Maryland drivers license. I asked Ms. Phillips what had occurred, and she stated that she didnt remember and that she must have fallen asleep and ended up in the ditch. I observed that Ms. Phillips had bloodshot, glassy eyes. Additionally, when I asked Ms. Phillips what had happened, I also asked her to retrieve her license and registration. Ms. Phillips was struggling to speak to me and retrieve her documents at the same time, indicating an inability to maintain divided attention. Based off of Ms. Phillips statements to how the vehicle had ended up in the ditch and the observations I made, I decided to place Ms. Phillips on Standarized Field Sobriety Testing.  I had Ms. Phillips put on proper footwear and exit the vehicle to the front of her vehicle.  Ms. Phillips advised that she wasnt injured or under the care of a physician. Ms. Phillips advised that she does not take any medications, but that she did smoke marijuana at approximately 1600-1700 hours. Ms. Phillips did advise that she was under the care of a therapist.  HGN: 6/6  I explained the test to Ms. Phillips. During this test, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Ms. Phillips breath and person. I observed that Ms. Phillips had equal pupil size and was able to equally track the stimulus. During this test, I observed6total clues.  -Lack of smooth pursuit -Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation -Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees  Walk and Turn: 6/8  For this test, I made sure to place Ms. Philips on a portion of roadway that I deemed to be level and free from debris. I did observe a slight slant in the initial spot Ms. Phillips was standing in and observe gravel on the shoulder portion as well. As a result, I moved Ms. Phillips position on the shoulder so that she was more level and free of debris. I explained and demonstrated the test to Ms. Phillips, who stated she understood. While explaining the test, Ms. Phillips immediately began to start the test. I advised Ms. Phillips to stop and wait for me to finish explaining. Ms. Phillips began the test and immediately missed heel to toe. On step 4, Ms. Phillips stepped offline and almost stumbled over. Ms. Phillips again stepped offline on step 8. Ms. Phillips took 12 steps total on the first 9. Ms. Phillips initially forgot the turn and stopped walking, and then when reminded, performed an improper turn as she did not leave her lead foot planted as instructed. On the return 9 steps, Ms. Phillips missed heel to toe and stepped offline. Ms Philips took 13 steps on the return 9 steps. Ms. Phillips did not perform the test to my satisfaction as I observed6/8clues.  -Starts too soon -Steps offline -Misses heel to toe -Stops walking -Improper number of steps -Improper turn  One Leg Stand: 2/4  I explained and demonstrated this test to Ms. Phillips who stated that she understood. Ms. Phillips was placed on a level portion of the roadway. Ms. Phillips chose to balance on her left foot. Ms. Phillips placed her foot down one time during the test, and swayed back and forth by approximately 3 inches during the test. Ms. Phillips did not perform this test to my satisfaction as I observed 2/4clues on this test.  -Puts foot down -Sways  PBT: 0.93  I offered Ms. Philips the preliminary breath test, which she agreed to take. I observed that the PBT was at a 0.93 at its highest point, and placed the PBT in my pocket. I did not observe what the final reading was at. I placed Ms. Phillips under arrest for a DUI at approximately 0351 hours.  Due to the circumstances of Ms. Phillips children in the vehicle, I had Ms. Phillips sit in the passenger seat of her vehicle until I had an additional unit to watch the children. As Ms. Phillips sat in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, I observed an open bottle of New Amsterdam vodka on the floorboard under the drivers seat.  Ms. Phillips mother was also contacted to pick the children up from the scene. Ms. Phillips was transported to the Maryland State Police Easton barrack where she was read the DR-15 and agreed to take the breath test at approximately 0427 hours.  Breath Test Result: 0.09  Ms. Phillips submitted to the breath test at approximately 0527 hours and resulted in a 0.09. The instrument was operated by Cpl. J. Cannon #6360.  All paperwork has been uploaded to the attachments section of this report.  All events occurred in Talbot County, MD. </NarrativeText>
