         <NarrativeText>DUI Case Number: 23-026 / 23MSP005418 Drivers license: (MD) H-452-115-730-070 Subsequent Offender: No  Intoximeter results: .24 BrAC This traffic stop was recorded on body worn camera (Tpr. Gardner #7503, TFC Sabock #6924, M/Tpr. Williams #4773), and in car camera (H-15).  Certifications and training:  Certified in the administration of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  Vehicle in motion:  On February 11, 2023 at approximately 2250 hours, I, Trooper Gardner #7503, was operating marked MSP patrol vehicle H-15 in the area of Crain Highway and Billingsley Road, White Plains, Charles County, Maryland. I observed a silver Toyota Venza bearing MD registration 3DN5749 traveling slowly on the right shoulder of southbound Crain Highway. The vehicle came to a complete stop on the shoulder with hazard lights activated. I activated my emergency equipment and stopped vehicle to check the drivers welfare.  Personal Contact:  Upon initial approach, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. The drivers eyes were blood shot and glassy and her speech was slurred. I asked the driver how much she had to drink and she stated she had not even two Margaritas at the crafty crab, a local bar located in Waldorf. I asked the driver why she was stopped in the shoulder of the highway and she stated that she pulled over so that she could have a conversation with the passenger in her vehicle. I identified the driver as Chanel Renne Holmes (AA/F DOB: 01/26/1999). I requested an additional unit to conduct standardized field sobriety testing.  Pre-Arrest Screening:  Holmes agreed to preform Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. The tests were conducted in front of the silver Venza on the side of Crain Highway on the right shoulder. The shoulder was dry, level, and clear of debris. The area was illuminated by headlights and flashlights. The front emergency equipment on all vehicles were deactivated.   I asked Holmes if she was on any medications or had any medical conditions that would impact her ability to conduct standardized field sobriety testing. She stated she did not, Holmes was wearing glasses, she stated she wore the glasses for a stigmatism and was asked to remove the glasses for testing purposes. I explained and demonstrated each of the tests and Holmes stated that she understood the instructions. Holmes was wearing black pants, a black shirt with a black jacket.  Test One  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus  Holmes eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Her pupils were equal sized and she displayed equal tracking in both eyes. Holmes had to be reminded to follow the stimulus with her eyes and to keep her head straight. Holmes displayed vertical gaze nystagmus in both eyes during testing.  1. Holmes displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes  2. Holmes displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes  3. Holmes displayed nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes  Total Clues: 6 of 6  Test Two  Walk and Turn 1. Holmes was unable to keep balance during the instructional portion of the test.  2. Holmes broke heel to toe contact on all steps in both series of nine steps.  3. Holmes stepped off line on all steps in both series of nine steps.  4. Holmes failed to take a series of small steps to turn.  5. Holmes raised arms for balance for the entirety of the test.  Total Clues: 5 of 8 Test Three  One Leg Stand Holmes started counting at one-thousand three. Holmes attempted to stop the test after one-thousand twenty-two. Holmes counted one-thousand twenty-two twice.  1. Holmes placed her foot down on count one-thousand twenty-two. 2. Holmes swayed side to side during the entire test.  3. Holmes raised her arms for balance during the entire test.  4. Holmes hopped while losing balance on one-thousand twelve, one-thousand twenty, and one-thousand twenty-two. Total Clues 4 of 4: Additional Processing:  After the completion of standardized field sobriety testing, Holmes was offered a preliminary breath test and agreed to submit. Holmes gave a breath alcohol concentration of .24 BAC. Holmes was placed under arrest for DUI and a digital copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights was played from the MVA website for Holmes. Holmes agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and was transported to the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack. Holmes submitted to the intoximeter test which was conducted by Corporal Meurrens #6372 at 2349 hours. The result of the test was .24 BrAC. Holmes was issued three citations for DUI related offenses and released to a sober driver at the barrack. All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland. Case closed by Arrest.  </NarrativeText>
