         <NarrativeText>STOP WAS RECORDED   font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-thickness:initial"&gt;Narrative:    On 1/10/2023 at approximately 1627 hours, I was dispatched to US RT 50 in the area of Skipton Creek Rd for a motor vehicle traveling westbound in the eastbound lane. At approximately 1628 hours, dispatched advised that vehicle was involved in a head on collision with a Centreville Police Department vehicle. Dispatch also advised the driver of the vehicle was detained.  Upon my arrival, I observed an orange Mitsubishi Eclipse bearing MD registration 6DT3032 with heavy front end damage and a black Centreville Police Department Ford Explorer to have damage along the driver side of the vehicle. I met with Sgt Harris, with Centreville Police Department, and he stated the following. He was traveling eastbound in lane 1 on US RT 50 in the area of Skipton Creek as he was transporting Alexander John Gates, front seat passenger, to Easton Memorial Hospital for an emergency petition. When the vehicle in front of him swerved to the right into lane 2, and he observed an orange Mitsubishi Eclipse traveling westbound in lane 1 on the eastbound side. As the vehicle continued in lane 1 towards Sgt Harris, he swerved last minute and was struck by the vehicle. Sgt Harris was able to exit his vehicle and make contact with driver of the vehicle and detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her breath and person. At which time he detained her until I arrived. I met with Theresa Ann Anderson, who was the driver of the Mitsubishi. Anderson was seated in the back of an Anne Arundel marked police vehicle. At approximately 1643 hours I read Anderson her Miranda Rights as she waived them. While speaking with Anderson I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her breath and she displayed glassy red blood shot eyes. I asked Anderson how much alcohol she had to drink as she stated a lot. I had Anderson exit the vehicle so I could switch handcuffs. As Anderson exited the vehicle, she began to stumble. Once I swapped handcuffs, I escorted her to my vehicle and escorted her to the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, where I would complete Standardized Field Sobriety Tests on Anderson. While en route, Anderson stated she was having marital problems and became very emotional and fearful that her husband would find and come pick her up. I asked Anderson why she was traveling in the wrong direction, and she began to mumble. I asked if she was trying to hurt herself. Anderson became silent and stared at me. Anderson stated if I say yes then youre going to take me to a mental hospital. Anderson became more emotional and stated shes going to get in trouble with her husband. I asked several times if she was trying to hurt herself by getting into an accident. Anderson began staring at me again and stated If I say yes can you keep me away from him for a while. I asked Anderson if her husband was abusive to her, as she started to breathe heavy before stating she doesnt want to upset anyone. Anderson continued to state its going to be bad for her, and she cant handle it anymore. I asked Anderson one more time if she was trying to hurt herself, as she began to get emotional, stared at me and nodded her head yes before stating Im done, Im done with everything. Once at the barrack, I conducted SFSTs with Anderson. Before conducting SFSTs I asked Anderson how much alcohol she had to drink as she stated too much. Anderson stated she was drinking vodka and diet coke. I had Andersonrate herself from 1 being sober to 10 being the most intoxicated shes ever been which she stated this is the most Ive here drank in my life so 10. I asked Anderson is she felt safe to drive as she stated no.   font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-thickness:initial"&gt;Field Sobriety:    I asked Anderson if shed taken any medication or suffered an injury that would prevent her from performing field sobriety tests, as Anderson stated no. Each test was demonstrated prior to Anderson attempting it.   font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-thickness:initial"&gt;Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus: 1. Anderson displayed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; 2. Anderson displayed distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; 3. Anderson displayed Nystagmus onset prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; I had to ask Anderson to following the stimulus approximately 5 times, before she shook her head and stated it doesnt matter Im already screwed.  Anderson swayed side to side and front to back throughout the test.  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Total Clues: 6 of 6 font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-thickness:initial"&gt;Walk and Turn: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; 1. While demonstrating the test, Anderson began to take the test before stopping and stated its not going to work and she did not want to try it.  Total Clues: 1 of 8   font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-thickness:initial"&gt;One Leg Stand: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; As I demonstrated the test Anderson stated she cant do it due to medical problems, and its not going to happen.  Total Clues: Refusal    I offered Anderson the Preliminary Breath Test which she agreed to take and provided a breath sample reading of .25.    Based on Andersons performance on field sobriety, she was placed under arrest. Anderson was read her DR-15 Advice of Rights at approximately 1743 hours which she refused to take.    Anderson was issued the following citations. - TA 21-902(B1) - Driving While Impaired by Alcohol font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; - TA 21-902(A1) - Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; - TA 21-901.1(B) - Negligent Driving font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; - TA 21-901.1(A)  Reckless Driving font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; - TA 21-801(B)  Failure to Control Veh Speed on Highway to Avoid Collision - TA 21-201 (A1)  Driver Failure to Obey Properly Placed Traffic Control Device Instructions - TA 21-203 (A)  Driving Wrong-Way-One Way Street  During and after the tests Anderson repeatedly asked me to not have her husband come get her. I made contacted Mid-Shore Council and spoke with counselor Connie. I explained to Connie the situation. While speaking with Connie, Anderson stated she did not want to talk. I provided Anderson, Connies contact information if she wished to call at a later time. I also explained to Anderson how to get a protective order and the importance of a protective order.  I then transported Anderson to University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton where I completed a petition for emergency evaluation. At approximately 1929 hours, Anderson was release to the care of hospital staff.  Case CLOSED by arrest. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  All events occurred in Talbot County, MD </NarrativeText>
