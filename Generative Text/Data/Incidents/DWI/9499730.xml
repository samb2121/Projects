         <NarrativeText>I- 10 In-car camera and body camera operational. The incident was captured on camera.  TRAINING:  * I am Certified by NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to Administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  * I attended and successfully completed A.R.I.D.E (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) training- February 2018.  * I attended and successfully completed a 3-day Maryland Driving Impaired Conference-Enhancing Enforcement to Achieve Zero Deaths- Oct./ Nov. 2022.  Defendant: Joseph Washington Jr. Date of Birth: 9/5/1972. Address: 4846 Kraft Rd. Vienna, MD 21869 Date of Arrest: 08/06/2023. Time of arrest: 1715 Hours. DUI #: 23-58-163.  ATTACHMENTS: 1. MVA information. 2. Traffic violation. 3. DR-15. 4. DR-15-A. (AJW06233). 5. Alcohol concentration test results.  DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS: No digital photographs are associated with this case.  SCENE PROCESSING: I contacted the driver and smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I further observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy with his speech to be slurred and slow. I requested the driver complete three (3) standardized field sobriety tests, which he did agree to. Driver was unable to complete 2 of the 3 tests, the driver did not complete the tests to my satisfaction. The driver was placed under arrest for DUI.  VEHICLE IN MOTION: (Phase 1)  On August 6, 2023, at approximately 1603 hours, I, TFC. Meekins, Easton Patrol, was dispatched to 4846 Kraft Rd. for a possible unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. I arrived at the residence and contacted the caller, identified as Roberta Tonoa Ennals (2/12/1962). Ennals advised she and her boyfriend, Joseph Washington Jr. (9/5/1972), had gotten into a small verbal argument, and she had gone to the back room. Ennals advised when she came out she found Washington had taken her vehicle. While speaking with Ennals, I learned her son had been in contact with Washington and advised Washington would have the vehicle back at her residence within the hour. Ennals was fine with this and no further action was taken. I cleared the residence for a short time. I then received an additional call for service and was advised Ennals son was on his way to that residence. Ennals son advised that Washington was also on his way to the residence and that Washington was going to hurt Ennals son when he got there. I then relayed back to the residence. When I arrived at the residence, I observed Washington backing the vehicle into the driveway.  PERSONAL CONTACT: (Phase 2)  I contacted Washington while still in the driver seat with the vehicle running. I asked Washington what had been going on that day with him advising they go into a little argument, and he just decided to leave to allow things to calm down. During my contact with Washington I smelled the overwhelming odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I also observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy with his speech to be slurred and slow. I asked Washington how much alcohol he had consumed when he advised he had consumed a few beers earlier. I asked Washington to exit the vehicle to conduct SFSTs, which he did agree to.  PRE- ARREST SCREENING: (Phase 3)  I asked Washington if he had any medical or physical disabilities that would prevent him from attempting to complete SFSTs, which when asked Washington advised he had a problem with his left leg. Washington showed me a scar above his left knee. I then asked Washington if he had any problems with his eyes at which time Washington advised he had a cataract on his right eye. Washington advised he was not taking any medications. SFSTs were conducted on Kraft Rd. in front of my patrol vehicle. The surface was dry and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear with minimal traffic. The lighting conditions were during daytime hours.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: (HGN) (6 of 6 clues observed).  The first test given to Washington was HGN. I utilized my pen with a black tip as a stimulus, which when asked Washington stated he could see. Washington was instructed to look straight ahead and to keep his eyes focused on the tip of the stimulus until instructed to stop. Washingtons pupils were equal in size and showed no resting nystagmus. I instructed Washington to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes and eyes only without moving his head, Washington advised he understood my instructions. The stimulus was passed horizontally approximately 12-15 inches from Washingtons face and slightly above eye level. Washington was noted to have equal tracking in both eyes. During the test, I observed 6 of 6 clues.  1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit in both eyes. 2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation present in both eyes. 3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN TEST: (WT) (0 of 8 clues observed)  Before Washington performed the WT test, I attempted to explain and demonstrate the test when Washington advised he would not be able to do this test because of his leg.    ONE LEG STAND: (OLS) (3 of 4 clues observed)  Before Washington performed the OLS test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Washington was instructed to stand with his heels and toes together and to keep his hands down by his side while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise his foot, of his choice, off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his foot was raised he was instructed to count out loud by thousands (one one-thousand, two one-thousand, and so on). Washington was instructed to continue the test until told to stop. When asked, Washington advised he did not think he could do this test either. I asked Washington if he would like to try as he had problems with his left leg and not his right. Washington advised he would try but he was very tired from cutting the grass.  Balance and Counting:  Washington attempted the test, however he immediately put his foot down, swayed, raised his arms greater than 6 inches, and stumbled to his right before regaining his balance. Washington advised he would not be able to do this test either.  ARREST:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Washington was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  1. Washington was observed operating the vehicle. 2. Admission to consuming alcohol while driving. 3. Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Washingtons breath and person. 4. Eyes bloodshot and glassy. 5. Speech slurred and slow. 6. Clues during SFSTs.  ARREST:  At approximately 1715 hours, I placed Washington under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. Washington was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. Upon re-entering my patrol vehicle there was an odor of an alcoholic beverage present in my vehicle that had not been there prior. Washington was played his DR-15 advice of rights. Washington agreed to the alcohol concentration test.  ** Prior to leaving the residence, I provided Ennals son with information in regard to obtaining a protective order against Washington. **  ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION TEST:  Washington was transported to the MSP Easton Barrack for the alcohol concentration test. While at the Barrack Washington completed the alcohol concentration test with a result of .25 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 1826 hours.  Washington was issued all paperwork and released back to Ennals who advised they would not have any further problems tonight. Ennals also advised her son does not live at her residence and she would make sure Washington and his did not have any further contact.   All events did occur in Dorchester County. Case closed. </NarrativeText>
