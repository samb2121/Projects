         <NarrativeText>The incident was audibly and visually recorded from my BWC. MSP unmarked unit D-24 is equipped with MVR equipment. DEFENDANT: JASON SHANE RAMAKER Date of Birth: 11/06/1972 (50 years old) Date of Arrest: 01/08/2023 Time of Arrest: 0120 hours DUI #: 23-009 (Bel Air Barrack, Harford County) Subsequent Offender: No Minor in the vehicle: No TX-DL. # 0206998 CDL: No Certificate and Training: *I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with participants at the Maryland State Police Academy and prior DUI/DWI arrests and convictions. *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *RADAR / LIDAR Certified 2019. *Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator Certified. *Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement Certified (ARIDE): Attended ARIDE with the Maryland State Police in January 2021 *UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND DUI INSTITUTE: I attended the University of Maryland DUI Institute, and I completed the course with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live participants (From June 5 to June 10, 2022) *Certified as SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge Martin H. Schreiber II in Baltimore City Circuit Court on September 27, 2022. *Certified SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge David E. Carey in Harford County District Court on October 11, 2022. *I have apprehended more than 150 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On January 08, 2023, at approximately 0107 hours, I, Trooper First Class Reckeweg # 7214 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Bel Air Barrack (unmarked MSP patrol vehicle D-24), was traveling on southbound Route 24 prior to east Ring Factory Road. At that time, I observed ahead of my patrol vehicle a white Lexus RX450 in lane two (2). The Lexus appeared to be traveling above the posted speed limit of 55mph. I accelerated my patrol vehicle to 70mph, attempting to pace the Lexus, but the Lexus was pulling away from my patrol vehicle at some speed greater than 70mph. I then activated my in-car moving radar system (Golden Eagle II) and selected the front radar dish for speed acquisition. My radar system registered a continuous radar tone and speed reading of 80mph, while there was only one vehicle (the Lexus) in front of my patrol vehicle within the operating range of my radar system. The radar tone and radar speed matched my visual speed estimate of the Lexus. I also observed the Lexus swerve to the right and go over to the right shoulder, crossing the solid line dividing lane two (2) from the right shoulder. The Lexus regained control and returned to lane two (2). The Lexus continued swerving within lane two (2). The Lexus swerved to the right and went over the solid line dividing lane two (2) from the right shoulder and drove on the right shoulder. The Lexus regained control and returned to lane two (2). I pulled behind the Lexus, and a traffic stop was initiated as I activated my emergency equipment. The Lexus stopped on the right shoulder of southbound Route 24 prior to Plumtree Road, Bel Air, Harford County. I then observed the Lexus bearing Texas registration NDG9440. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the Lexus via the passengers side window, made contact with the driver, and explained to the driver the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver for his drivers drivers license. The driver advised that he lost his wallet with his drivers license and provided me with his name. The driver was identified as the Lexus register owner to be RAMAKER, JASON SHANE (W/M, DOB 11/21/1973, Texas Soundex 0206998). I asked RAMAKER where he was coming from and where he was going. RAMAKER advised me that he was coming from a Club and going to his house in Pennsylvania. While talking to RAMAKER, I instantly noticed his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from inside the Lexus. RAMAKERs speech was slurred. I observed RAMAKER had an orange bar wristband on the right wrist. A plastic cup in the center console (3/4 full) contained ice cubes and an unknown alcoholic beverage. I asked RAMAKER about the plastic cup in the center console, and he advised that it was an alcoholic drink. I asked RAMAKER how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that evening, and he stated, I had a couple of drinks. I asked RAMAKER to exit and walk to the front of my patrol vehicle. RAMAKER exited his vehicle, opened the right rear passenger door to get his jacket, and found his wallet with his drivers license on the floor mat. RAMAKER was stumbling while walking to the front of my patrol vehicle. At the front of my patrol vehicle, I could now detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on RAMAKERs breath and person. RAMAKER had difficulty keeping his balance as he swayed from left to right. I advised RAMAKER that I would perform SFST on him, which he refused to submit, stating, if you gonna arrest me, go ahead. I asked RAMAKER if there was any reason why he did not want to perform the standardized field sobriety test, and he replied, because I had been a police officer, I know my rights.   The summary of the first contact is as follows: Attitude: Uncooperative Eye Condition: Glassy/bloodshot Mental State: Normal. Walk: Stumbling Speech: Slurred. ARREST Based on my knowledge, training, and experience as an MSP Trooper, previous DUI arrests, and clues gathered thus far, I had reason to believe RAMAKER was driving a motor vehicle while impaired (under the influence of Alcohol). *Driving over the posted speed limit of 80/55MPH * Physical control of a motor vehicle *admission of consumption of alcoholic beverage *Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person *Bloodshot eyes *Slurred speech *Watery eyes * My observed signs of impairment through my encounter with the defendant. ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) / CERTIFIED BREATH TEST (AGREED)/ CPL. ATKINSON # 5323 (Maryland State Police). I arrested RAMAKER for driving under the influence of Alcohol at approximately 0120 hours. RAMAKER was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to Maryland State Police Bel Air-Barrack for processing, where a mouth check was performed 20 minutes before his submission to the breath test. RAMAKER was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to follow along with as the DR-15 advice of rights was played to him from the official MVA website. At the conclusion of the DR-15, RAMAKER refused to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same at approximately 0204 hours. At approximately 0414 hours, RAMAKER was given all copies of pertinent paperwork, and RAMAKER was transported to the Harford County Detention Center. RAMAKER was cooperative during the processing. Case Status  Closed by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
