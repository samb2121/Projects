WHITE- ID #6931 MARYLAND STATE POLICE  FORESTVILLE BARRACK L CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING: -NHTSA CERTIFIED TO CONDUCT STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFST) -CERTIFIED PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) OPERATOR -ADVANCED ROADSIDE IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT TRAINING (A.R.I.D.E)  DESCRIPTION OF VIOLATION / INCIDENT / TRAFFIC STOP (VEHICLE IN MOTION)- On March 8, 2023, at approximately 2233 hours, I Trooper First Class White #6931, was dispatched to southbound Route 202 in the area of the Capital Beltway, Prince Georges County, Maryland, in reference to an SUV stopped in the median of the roadway.  Upon arrival, I observed a gray Toyota Rav-4 bearing Maryland registration plate 2DS7163 stopped on the center median of the roadway. It appeared the vehicle drove off the left side of the roadway, onto the median. First Sergeant B Weismann #5573 and Metro Transit Police Officers were on scene.   INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEFENDANT (PERSONAL CONTACT)-  I made contact with driver, who was identified by his Maryland driver license as Julio Cesar Diaz-Iglesias, DOB: 04/14/1995, Hispanic/male.  While speaking to Diaz-Iglesias, I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I also I observed his eyes to be glassy.  Diaz-Inglesias was unable to speak English well. I advised Diaz-Iglesias that he was not under arrest at the time and transported him to the Maryland State Police Forestville barrack where we met Prince Georges County Sheriff, Deputy Harrison #626 to assist me with English/Spanish translation. Upon arrival to the barrack, I informed Diaz-Iglesias that I would be administering standardized field sobriety tests (SFST) on him, to which he agreed to the tests. Prior to administering SFST, I advised Diaz-Iglesias I was going to explain the instructions to each of the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed inside the Maryland State Police Forestville Barracks downstairs hallway. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions were clear due to the Barracks lighting which illuminated the area. Diaz-Iglesias appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. Diaz-Iglesias was asked the following questions: Glasses or Contacts  None Medical Conditions  None. Injuries  None Medication Aspirin taken at 0600 hours.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Diaz-Iglesias eyes. Diaz-Iglesias was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Diaz-Iglesias pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. While administering this test, Diaz-Iglesias moved his head on several occasions. Diaz-Iglesias had to be reminded not to move his head.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN  (3/8 clues observed). Prior to Diaz-Iglesias performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Diaz-Iglesias if he understood the test, and he advised he understood.  Instructional stage: 1.) Lost balance - Feet broke apart, and he stepped offline to the right.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1. ) Missed heal to toe on steps 2,3,5-9  Turn: Nothing to report.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  1.)Missed heal to toe on all steps  2.) Incorrect number of steps: Took 10 steps instead of the instructed 9.  ONE LEG STAND (No clues observed)  Prior to Diaz-Iglesias performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Diaz-Iglesias was asked if he understood the test and the instructions. Diaz-Iglesias advised he understood.  Balance and Count Stage: Nothing to report.  Seconds 0-10: Nothing to report  Seconds 10-20: Nothing to report   Seconds 20-30: Nothing to report  ARREST Based on the following, I had probable cause to believe Diaz-Iglesias was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  *Failure to Drive Vehicle on Right Half of Roadway When Required. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his body and breath * Glassy eyes * Slurred speech * My observed signs of impairment as Diaz-Iglesias performed field sobriety tests * Asleep behind the wheel of motor-vehicle while operating motor-vehicle.  Diaz-Iglesias was placed under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol.  Diaz-Iglesias was read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form in Spanish via audioat which time heagreed to take the breath test at 0110 hours.  I transported Diaz-Iglesias to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack where the breath test was administered.  The breath test was conducted by Sgt. D Jackson #4982 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Diaz-Iglesias provided an insufficient breath sample at 0205 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT ***** Insufficient Sample*****  Diaz-Iglesias was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and transported to his residence located at 5900 Rayburn Dr Temple Hills, MD 20748 where he was released.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
