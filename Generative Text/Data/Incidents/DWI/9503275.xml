         <NarrativeText>The incident was audibly and visually recorded from my BWC. MSP unmarked unit D-24 is equipped with MVR equipment. DEFENDANT: CALLAHAN, THOMAS HENRY Date of Birth: 11/22/1982 (39 years old) Date of Arrest: 02/03/2023 Time of Arrest: 0117 hours DUI #: 23-034 (Bel Air Barrack, Harford County) Subsequent Offender: No Minor in the vehicle: No MI-DL. # C-450-792-303-893 CDL: No Certificate and Training: *I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with participants at the Maryland State Police Academy and prior DUI/DWI arrests and convictions. *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *RADAR / LIDAR Certified 2019. *Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator Certified. *Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement Certified (ARIDE): Attended ARIDE with the Maryland State Police in January 2021 *UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND DUI INSTITUTE: I attended the University of Maryland DUI Institute, and I completed the course with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live participants (From June 5 to June 10, 2022) *Certified as SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge Martin H. Schreiber II in Baltimore City Circuit Court on September 27, 2022. *Certified SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge David E. Carey in Harford County District Court on October 11, 2022. *I have apprehended more than 150 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 03, 2023, at approximately 0054 hours, I, Trooper First Class Reckeweg # 7214 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Bel Air Barrack (unmarked MSP patrol vehicle D-24), was traveling in lane one (1) on southbound Route 924 prior to West Wheel Road. At that time, I observed a blue Honda sedan ahead of my patrol vehicle. The Honda swerved to the right and went over the solid line dividing lane one (1) from the right shoulder by its tire width. The Honda regained control but kept swerving within lane one (1). The Honda swerved to the right and a second time crossed the solid line dividing lane one (1) from the right shoulder. The Honda regained control and returned to lane one (1). I also observed the Hondas center brake light was not functional (equipment violation). I pulled behind the Honda, and a traffic stop was initiated as I activated my emergency equipment. The Honda stopped on the right shoulder of southbound Route 924 prior to Old Emmorton Road, Abingdon, Harford County. I then observed the Honda bearing Maryland registration 8CJ6716. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Honda via the passengers side window, made contact with the driver (only occupant), and explained to the driver the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver for his drivers license. The driver handed me a Maryland drivers license and was identified as CALLAHAN, THOMAS HENRY (W/M, DOB 11/22/1983, Maryland Soundex C-450-792-303-983) by his drivers license. I asked CALLAHAN where he was coming from and where he was going. CALLAHAN advised that he was coming from Looneys bar and going to his house. While talking to CALLAHAN, I instantly noticed his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from inside the Honda. The drivers speech was slurred. I asked the driver how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that evening, and he stated, I had one (1) drink. I asked CALLAHAN to exit and walk to the front of my patrol vehicle. CALLAHAN stumbled while walking to the front of my patrol vehicle. At the front of my patrol vehicle, I could now detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on CALLAHANs breath and person. I advised CALLAHAN that I had detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath and person. I asked CALLAHAN again how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that evening. CALLAHAN changed his answer this time and advised that he had had two (2) drinks two (2) hours ago. I observed CALLAHAN having difficulty keeping his balance as he swayed from left to right. I advised CALLAHAN that I would perform standardized field sobriety test on him, which he agreed to submit. The summary of the first contact is as follows: Attitude: Cooperative Eye Condition: Glassy/bloodshot Mental State: Normal. Walk: Stumbling. Speech: Slurred. I asked CALLAHAN the following questions: Medication- Yes (last time taken medication was the previous month) Medical Conditions- No Glasses: No Any pain in the body- No. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The below standardized field sobriety tests were performed on the right shoulder on the roadway. That area of the road was level and free of debris. Before beginning the below standardized field sobriety tests, I turned off my front emergency lights. The weather conditions were clear. Lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicle headlights and my flashlight. CALLAHAN appeared in good physical condition and displayed no visible signs of injury. I explained and demonstrated the standardized field sobriety tests below to CALLAHAN. CALLAHAN stated he understood my instructions and had no questions about the standardized field sobriety test. -HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) / (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: YES) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my index finger from my right hand was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches from CALLAHANs eyes, slightly above his eyebrows. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. CALLAHANs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I observed his eyes to be red. CALLAHAN was positioned to ensure passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked CALLAHAN if he understood the instructions, and he stated, Yes. The following clues and observations were made during the test: Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes The onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes Additional test Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Present in both eyes -WALK AND TURN (WAT) / (6/8 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: Yes) Before CALLAHAN performed the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. CALLAHAN was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. CALLAHAN was instructed and demonstrated to put his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until instructed to begin. CALLAHAN was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on each step. CALLAHAN was asked to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count each step out loud. On the ninth step, CALLAHAN was explained, and I demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and planted and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around to his left. CALLAHAN was again explained, and I demonstrated that the second series of nine (9) steps were to be completed identically to the first. Keep his hands by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. I asked CALLAHAN if he understood the test. CALLAHAN stated, Yes. CALLAHAN was instructed to begin the test. Instructional Stage: Cannot Keep Balance: Unable to keep balance CALLAHAN started before instructed Walking Stage (1st Nine) CALLAHAN stepped offline on steps 2 and 3. CALLAHAN missed heel to toe by approximately 2 inches on step 5. CALLAHAN raised their arms more than 6 inches on step 9. Walking Stage (2nd nine): CALLAHAN stepped offline on steps 3, 6, and 9. CALLAHAN missed heel to toe by approximately 2 inches on steps 2, 6, and 8. Turn: Completed Unsatisfactory. CALLAHAN did not leave his front foot planted and used both feet to walk in a circle. -ONE LEG STAND (OLS) (LEFT LEG) (3/4 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: Yes) Before CALLAHAN performed the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. CALLAHAN was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given during the test. CALLAHAN was instructed to begin the test when he was asked to start and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to watch his raised foot and count out loud by thousands (thousand-one, thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked CALLAHAN if he had any questions about the test (OLS) which he replied, no. CALLAHAN raised his right foot. Instructional Stage: Nothing to report. Balance and Count Stage: 1. Sways: CALLAHAN swayed at the 08, 21, and 29-second mark. 2. Puts foot down: CALLAHAN puts his foot down on the 03, 04, 06, 08, 10, 14, 17, and 22-second mark 3. Raise arms: CALLAHAN raised his arms more than 6 inches at the 17-second mark. -PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) (REFUSED)- The final test offered to CALLAHAN was the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT). CALLAHAN was advised that he could refuse this test. CALLAHAN agreed to submit to the PBT with results of .17 BrAC (.17 hours) ARREST Based on my knowledge, training, and experience as an MSP Trooper, previous DUI arrests, and clues gathered thus far, I had reason to believe CALLAHAN was driving a motor vehicle while impaired (under the influence of Alcohol). *Swerving on the roadway. * Physical control of a motor vehicle. *admission of consumption of alcoholic beverages. *Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. *Bloodshot eyes. *Slurred speech. *Watery eyes. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed the standardized field sobriety. ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) / CERTIFIED BREATH TEST (AGREED)/ SGT. SANDER # 5948 (Maryland State Police). I arrested CALLAHAN for driving under the influence of Alcohol at approximately 0117 hours. CALLAHAN was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to Maryland State Police Bel Air-Barrack for processing, where a mouth check was performed 20 minutes before his submission to the breath test. CALLAHAN was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to follow along with as the DR-15 advice of rights was played to him from the official MVA website. At the conclusion of the DR-15, CALLAHAN agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15, indicating the same at approximately 0146 hours. CALLAHAN provided two breath examples with positive results of .19 BRAC. CALLAHAN was given all copies of pertinent paperwork, and CALLAHAN was released to a sober adult that came to Bel Air Barrack. INTOXIMETER RESULT: Results of .19 BRAC (0156 hours)  CALLAHAN was cooperative during the processing. Case Status  Closed by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
