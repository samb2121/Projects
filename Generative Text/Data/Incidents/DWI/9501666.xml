         <NarrativeText>The incident was audibly and visually recorded from my BWC. MSP unmarked unit D-24 is equipped with MVR equipment. DEFENDANT: WORTHY, MARK KIM Date of Birth: 08/25/1957 (66 years old) Date of Arrest: 11/19/2023 Time of Arrest: 1858 hours DUI #: 23-268 (Bel Air Barrack, Harford County) Subsequent Offender: No Minor in the vehicle: Yes (Amaya Mr. WORTHY DOB12/24/13, Aminique Mr. WORTHY DOB 02/04/10) MI-DL. # W630585469663 CDL: No Certificate and Training: *I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with participants at the Maryland State Police Academy and prior DUI/DWI arrests and convictions. *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *RADAR / LIDAR Certified 2019. *Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator Certified. *Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement Certified (ARIDE): Attended ARIDE with the Maryland State Police in January 2021 *UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND DUI INSTITUTE: I attended the University of Maryland DUI Institute, and I completed the course with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live participants (From June 5 to June 10, 2022) *Certified as SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge Martin H. Schreiber II in Baltimore City Circuit Court on September 27, 2022. *Certified SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge David E. Carey in Harford County District Court on October 11, 2022. *I have apprehended more than 180 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On November 19, 2023, at approximately 1811 hours, I, Trooper First Class Reckeweg #7214 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Bel Air Barrack (unmarked MSP patrol vehicle D-24), was traveling in lane one (1) on southbound Edgewood Road prior to Route 40 Road, Edgewood. At this time, I observed a Gold Ford Taurus ahead of my patrol vehicle. The Ford swerved two times to the right and went over the solid line dividing lane one (1) from the right shoulder by its tire width. The Ford regained control and returned to lane one (1). The Ford was bearing Maryland registration 7FL6404 (suspended registration). I pulled behind the Ford, and a traffic stop was initiated as I activated my emergency equipment. The Ford stopped in the parking lot of 1018 Edgewood Road, Edgewood, Harford County. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Ford via the drivers side window, contacted the driver, and explained the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver for his drivers license and registration. The driver handed me a Maryland identification card and was identified as WORTHY, MARK KIM (B/M, DOB 08/25/1957, Maryland Soundex W630585469663). I observed three more occupants inside the Ford. The front passenger was identified as Turner, Alexander (B/M, DOB 01/04/1957, Maryland Soundex T656044024012) by his Maryland identification MVA photo record; the right rear passenger was identified as Worthy, Amaya (DOB 02/04/2010), and left rear passenger was identified as Worthy, Aminique (DOB 12/24/2013) daughters of Mr. WORTHY. I asked Mr. WORTHY where he was coming from and where he was going. Mr. WORTHY advised that he was coming from dropping his stepson and he was going to his house. While talking to Mr. WORTHY, I instantly noticed his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from inside the Ford. Mr. WORTHYs speech was slurred. I asked Mr. Worthy how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that evening, and he stated, I had two or three beers at the restaurant. I advised Mr. WORTHY that I had detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from inside the Ford, and Turned showed me a bottle of Smirnoff (8fl oz., 4.5% ALC, half empty).    I asked Mr. WORTHY to exit and walk to the front of my patrol vehicle. I observed Mr. WORTHY stumbling while walking to the front of my patrol vehicle. At the front of my patrol vehicle, I could detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on Mr. WORTHYs breath and person. Mr. Worthy was chewing gummy bears, attempting to mask the odor of alcoholic beverages emitting from his breath and person. I asked Mr. WORTHY why he was chewing gummy bears (he had not been chewing gummy bears before). He told me that he was chewing gummy bears because of the odor of alcoholic beverages emitting from his breath and person. I observed Mr. WORTHY having difficulty keeping his balance as he swayed from left to right. I advised Mr. WORTHY that I would perform SFST on him, which he agreed to submit. Mr. WORTHY told me he needed to urinate, which he stated it was urgent. Mr. Worthy urinated on the side of the parking lot. The summary of the first contact is as follows: Attitude: cooperative Eye Condition: Glassy/bloodshot Mental State: Normal. Walk: Stumbling. Speech: Slurred. I asked MR. WORTHY the following questions: Medication- Yes (Oxycodone, Tamsulosin, two more medications, and he had taken medication two (2) hours before the traffic stop) Medical Conditions- Yes Glasses: No Any pain in the body- Yes (Sciatica, tights and arms) PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The below standardized field sobriety tests were performed in the parking lot of 1018 Edgewood Road, Edgewood, Harford County. That area of the parking lot was level and free of debris. I turned off my front emergency lights before beginning the standardized field sobriety tests below. The weather conditions were clear. Lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicle headlights, parking lot lights, and my flashlight. Mr. WORTHY appeared in good physical condition and displayed no visible signs of injury. I explained and demonstrated the standardized field sobriety tests below to Mr. WORTHY. Mr. WORTHY stated he understood my instructions and had no questions about the standardized field sobriety test. -HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) / (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: YES) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my index finger from my right hand was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches from Mr. WORTHYs eyes, slightly above his eyebrows. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Mr. WORTHYs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Mr. WORTHY was positioned to ensure passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Mr. WORTHY if he understood the instructions, and he stated, Yes. The following clues and observations were made during the test: Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes The onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes Additional test Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Present in both eyes -WALK AND TURN (WAT) / (0/8 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: He cannot do it) As I was explained the walk and turn test to Mr. WORTHY, he told me that I would not be able to perform the rest of the Field Sobriety tests. -PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) (AGREED)- The final test offered to Mr. WORTHY was the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT). Mr. WORTHY was advised that he could refuse this test. Mr. WORTHY agreed to submit to the PBT test with results of .13 BrAC. ARREST Based on my knowledge, training, and experience as an Maryland State Trooper, previous DUI arrests, and clues gathered thus far, I had reason to believe Mr. WORTHY was driving a motor vehicle while impaired (under the influence of Alcohol). *Swerving on the roadway. *Physical control of a motor vehicle. *Admission of consumption of alcoholic beverages. *Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. *Bloodshot eyes. *Slurred speech. *Watery eyes. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed the standardized field sobriety. ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) / CERTIFIED BREATH TEST (AGREED)/ SERGEANT SANDER #5429 (Maryland State Police). I arrested Mr. WORTHY for driving under the influence of Alcohol at approximately 1858 hours. Mr. WORTHY was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack for processing, where a mouth check was performed 20 minutes before his submission to the breath test. Mr. WORTHY was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to follow along with as the DR-15 Advice of Rights was played to him from the official MVA website. At the conclusion of the DR-15, Mr. WORTHY agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15, indicating the same at approximately 1933 hours. Mr. WORTHY provided two breath examples with positive results of .11 BRAC (1951 hours). Mr. WORTHY was given all copies of pertinent paperwork, and Mr. WORTHY was released to a sober adult who came to Bel Air Barrack. Mr. WORTHY was yelling at me, calling me names, and telling his daughters not to listen to me; he told his daughters to get out of the car, causing them to cry. Mr. WORTHY was very uncooperative after he was placed under arrest. INTOXIMETER RESULT: Results of .11 BRAC (1951 hours) MR. WORTHY was uncooperative and ruthless and used profane language during the processing. Case Status  Closed by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
