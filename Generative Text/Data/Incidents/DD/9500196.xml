         <NarrativeText>                                                 Maryland State Police-Berlin Barrack V MSP marked vehicle V-11 is equipped with a mobile recording device.     Defendant: William Lee BowyerJr Drivers license #: MD-1027365651 Date of Arrest: 10/1/2023 Time of Arrest: 0253 hours DUI #: 23-96-301 PBT Results: 0.14 Intoximeter Results: 0.15   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING   -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. -Trained ARIDE test through the Maryland State Police. -Completed certified SFST instructor class.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 10/1/2023 at approximately 0235 hours, I, Trooper First Class C. Shubert #7062 with the Maryland State Police was on-duty operating unmarked patrol vehicle V-11 in the area of US Route 50 and Golf Course Road, Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland. At that time, I was stationary in the left turn lane observing westbound traffic when I observed a Gray Kia passenger vehicle in lane one that appeared to be traveling above the posted speed limit of 40MPH. I then activated my Kustom Golden Eagle radar unit front antenna and obtained a digital speed reading of 58MPH in a posted 40MPH speed zone. My radar unit was tested prior to and after my shift and was working properly.I activated the emergency equipment to my patrol vehicle and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle came to a complete stop on the right shoulder of US Route 50.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the driver. I advised the driver why he was being stopped. While speaking with the driver, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. The drivers speech was slurred and eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I identified the driver William Lee Bowyer Jr through his Maryland license. I asked Bowyer where he was coming from, to which he advised:Work. I then asked Bowyer how many alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving, to which he advised:Earlier in the night, Im tired. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine MVA checks on Bowyer. I later returned to Bowyers vehicle and asked him to step out and to walk to the front of his vehicle. Bowyer complied. While Bowyer got out of his vehicle he leaned back against his driver door due to intoxication. At the front of his vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Bowyers breath and person. I asked Bowyer how many alcoholic beverages he consumed in total, to which he advised:One drink earlier.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on the side of the road of US Route 50. The surface was flat and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 68 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight, vehicle headlights, and parking lot lighting. My forward emergency equipment was deactivated during all testing. Bowyer appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injury.   I asked Bowyer the following pre-testing questions:   1. Injuries: NO 2. Glasses: NO 3. Medications:Medication for high blood pressure.    WALK AND TURN (5 of 8 clues observed)   Instructional Stage      1, Broke heel to toe contact in an attempt to maintain balance.    2, started the test prior to being told to begin.   Walking Stage (1st Nine)    Stepped off of the line on step 4.  Took Twelve (12) steps instead of nine as demonstrated.  Stopped walking after step 3.    Walking Stage (2nd Nine):      1. Missed heel to toe contact more than half an inch on step 8.    Stepped off of the line on steps 4, 5, 7.    ONE LEG STAND (2 of 4 clues observed)    1,Raised arms more than six inches away from body on second 24.  2, Put foot down on second 2.    ADDITIONAL TESTING:    ALPHABET TEST     I asked Bowyer if he knew the English alphabet, to which he advised:Yes.I instructed Bowyer to recite from the letter H to the letter T without singing the alphabet. Bowyer completed the test as demonstrated.     COUNTING TEST    I asked Bowyer if he could count backwards, to which he stated:Yes.I instructed Bowyer to count backwards from 57 to 36. Bowyer completed the test as demonstrated.    PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST   I offered Bowyer the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test, Bowyer consented to the preliminary breath test with the result of 0.14 BrAC.    ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Bowyer was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   * Exceeding the posted speed limit. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.   At approximately 0253 hours, I placed Bowyer under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I placed Bowyer in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. While still on-scene, I played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Bowyer via the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) official website. At the conclusion of the audio version of the DR-15 form, I verbally repeated and reviewed the possible suspensions and sanctions that can be imposed by the MVA to Bowyers driving privilege. Bowyer submitted to the Intoximeter test and signed the same at approximately 0308 hours.   TRANSPORT   Bowyer was subsequently transported to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for further processing. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Bush continued to be strong.   ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION TEST RESULT: 0.15 BrAC   Prior to the test, TFC S. Shubert #6944 (certified intoximeter operator) checked Bowyers mouth for any foreign objects and none were found. TFC S. Shubert administered the breath test at approximately 0334 hours with a result of 0.15 BrAC. RELEASE   Bowyer was released to a sober adult from the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack at approximately 0350 hours.   CHARGES   Bowyer was charged with the following:   1.

All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
