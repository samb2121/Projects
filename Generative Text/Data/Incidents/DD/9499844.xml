         <NarrativeText>Attachments  -NCMEC Cybertip # 165738063 -Suspects Snapchat   -Snapchat preservation letter -Four images of the Snapchat account  Narrative  On July 6, 2023, the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Section /Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force received NCMEC CyberTip # 165738063. The CyberTip, generated by a concerned mother, Ashley Lyons, indicated that a subject was enticing and blackmailing her 14 year old son. The CyberTip was assigned to TFC Burnett for investigation.   The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the suspect: Relationship to Reporter: None Name: Denetria Ryan Screen/User Name: Snapchat: @ryan_6736382936  The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the victim: Relationship to Reporter: Son Name: Kaden Lyons Address: Leonardtown, MD US Date of Birth: 06-19-2009 Approximate Age: 14 Screen/User Name: Snapchat Display: Kaden Lyons  TFC Burnett reviewed this CyberTip and observed it to contain the below information from Ashley Lyons: The caller is the childs mother. The child met the reported person on Snapchat and sent nude photos. The reported person is now asking the child to send money or they will share the photos with the childs friends. The caller did not know if an amount or a way to send money was provided to the child. The reported person told the child, lets make a deal and asked how much he had. The caller did not have any other information at this time.  I contacted Ashley Lyons by phone and she explained that her son, Kaden Lyons was staying with his Aunt during this encounter. Ashley advised Kaden was messaged by an apparent female, Denetria Ryan on Instagram and told him to download Snapchat. Ashley explained Denetria asked for inappropriate images from Kaden, which he refused at first, but she kept nagging him. Ashley advised Kaden sent a picture of his penis to Denetria and she immediately started counting down, telling him to send money or she would send his picture to all of his friends. Once Denetria kept wanting money, Kaden told his Aunt. Ashley advised that Denetria attempted to call through Snapchat a couple times, but they did not answer.   Based on the information a Snapchat preservation letter was submitted, with the reference #dd18f1791a and a subpoena was sent to the Howard County States Attorneys Office.   Case Status OPEN / PENDING ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION</NarrativeText>
