I observed no damaged property.  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Physical Evidence: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; This incident was verbal only, and no physical evidence was gathered.   font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Narrative:  On January 22, 2024, at approximately 2110 hours, I responded to 21774 Essex Drive, Lexington Park, St. Marys County, Maryland 20653, for the report of a juvenile exiting her residence it what was believed to be an attempt to run away.  Upon arrival, I made contact with the juvenile, Darzaria Deines Warrick (B/F DOB: 08/12/2011), it should be noted no one on scene was sure on the correct spelling of Warricks name including herself. Warrick was on the front porch of the residence and appeared extremely agitated and did not wish to speak to me or answer questions.  I then made contact with the complainant, Debbie Ann Janifer (B/F DOB: 11/29/1971). Janifer informed me she is Warricks aunt and her current legal guardian. Janifer advised Warrick had recently finished styling her hair and had left a mess in the living room. Janifer informed me, she instructed Warrick to clean the mess; however Warrick was not cleaning it fast enough and a verbal argument ensued. Janifer said she told Warrick she was going to have to go back with her mother, at which time Warrick became irate and exited the residence in what Janifer believed to be an attempt to run away; however Warrick never did leave the property. Janifer provided me with a Notarized piece of notebook paper which stated Warricks mother was surrendering custody of Warrick to Janifer; however the paper also stated Janifer could surrender her custody of Warrick at any time for any reason. Janifer informed me she has had contact Joanne Smith with the Department of Social Service about Warrick. Janifer advised me, Smith informed her if she ever had an issue with Warrick to call the police, and they would take her away. I attempted to make contact with Smith at the provided phone number (240-434-1319) however there was no answer. Janifer was adamant she did not want Warrick back inside her house.  I made contact with Warrick again, and she agreed to go inside with Janifer provided she not be forced to go with her mother. During contact with Warrick she was argumentative and agitated. I asked Warrick several times if she was okay or in any danger, and she said as long as she did not have to go to her mothers hotel room she was not in danger. I asked Warrick numerous times if she had any suicidal or homicidal thoughts, and she stated she did not. Warrick said she was not trying to run away and only exited the house onto the front porch. Warrick was adamant if she was forced to go with her mother she would run away at that time. Warrick refused to speak during questioning about the verbal argument.  I made contact with Janifer again, and she agreed to allow Warrick to remain in the house for the evening until she could make contact with DSS in the morning and arrange to have Warrick removed from her custody.  I provided Janifer with a Victim Witness Pamphlet and the case number. I informed Janifer of my contact information should DSS need to contact me for any reason.  This case is closed non-criminal.  All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
