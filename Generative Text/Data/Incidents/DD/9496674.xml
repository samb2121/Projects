         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING: Ten photographs were taken of the victim, suspect, and victims injuries. A written statement was completed by the victim. A domestic violence supplement for was completed.  ATTACHMENTS/DOCUMENTS:   Ten (10) photographs digitally uploaded to this report  One (1) MSP Written Statement  One (1) MSP 246 Domestic Violcence Supplement Form  NARRATIVE: *In-car camera and BWC operational, T-12; captured*   *This incident occurred within sight and sound of children over the age of two years*  On Monday, January 9, 2023 at approximately 0324 hours, I responded to 23786 Myrtle Point Road California, MD 20619 for the report of a domestic disturbance.  Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant, identified as Alpha Roanna Ali (O/F DOB: 1/29/1979) by her MVA photograph. Alpha advised, she was in her daughters room, identified as Lillie Lillian Ali (O/F DOB: 10/19/2018) when her husband, identified as Fiad Mohammed Ali (A/M DOB: 12/25/1974) by his MVA photograph, entered the room and began yelling at her. Alpha advised Fiad yelled at her because he went through her text messages and saw she was texting a friend and telling her friend she felt like a maid. Alpha advised, Fiad took her phone, and attempted to remove her Apple Watch from her wrist. Alpha advised, Fiad grabbed the watch and tried to forcefully remove it by pulling the wristband. Alpha advised, during the incident Fiad scratchedher wrist with his fingernail. I observed an abrasion on Alphas left wrist. I also observed bruisingon Alphas left wrist due to the wristband tightening while Fiad was attempting to remove it. Alpha advised, she did not assault Fiad, and advised she and Fiad ended up rolling off of the bed and onto the floor during the incident. Alpha advised, she and Fiad are married and have three children in common. Alpha advised, she moved out of the residence in October, but moved back into the residence on Friday, January 6, 2023. Alphaadvised, Lillie was originally in the room where the incident occurred, but left when the incident started. Alpha advised, Lillie was asleep while I was on scene. I took multiple photographs of Alphas injuries to her wrist.  I made contact with Fiad who advised, Alpha has been having an affair. Fiad advised, he saw text messages between Alpha and the male she is currently having an affair with. Fiad advised, he attempted to confront Alpha about the text messages, and told her to stop texting the male, when Alpha claimed he was yelling at her. Fiad advised, he took possession of Alphas phone, which he has power of attorney to, and attempted to remove the Apple Watch from Alphas left wrist. Fiad advised, he accidentally scratched Alphas left wrist during the incident, but does not know exactly how it happened. Fiad advised, Alpha has thin skin and bruises easily. Fiad advised, he and Alpha ended up rolling off of the bed while they were fighting over possession of the watch. Fiad advised, Alpha did not assault him during the incident. Fiad advised, he and Alpha currently reside together and have three children in common. Fiad advised, Lillie was originally in the room where the incident occurred, but left when the incident started. Fiad advised, Lillie was asleep while I was on scene. I did not observe any signs of injury to Fiad. Fiad advised, he did not wish to complete a written statement.  It should be noted there is an active Protective Order in which Fiad is the Petitioner and Alpha is the Respondent. During this incident, no stipulations of the Final Protective Order were violated as Alpha did not abuse or threaten to abuse Fiad.  Alpha completed a written statement and MSP 246 Domestic Violence Supplement Form. Alpha screened in as high danger.  At approximately 0450 hours Tpr. Buglio contacted St. Marys County Family Advocacy Center and spoke with counselor Ryan Fox. Alpha advised, she did not wish to speak with Fox while on scene.  At approximately 0405 hours, I placed Fiad under arrest and transported him to St. Marys County Detention and Rehabilitation Center (SMCDRC) where he was left in the care and custody of SMCDRC staff.  Case closed by arrest.  All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On Wednesday, January 11, 2023 at approximately 1131 hours, I called the victim, Mrs. Ali. Mrs. Ali said she hasnt had contact with the suspect, he up and left the house with the kids. Mrs. Ali explained her husband took the children and hes staying at his mothers house in Upper Marlboro, MD. Mrs. Ali said she hasnt spoken to her children, she refuses to call her mother-in-law since she agitates the situation between her and her husband. Mrs. Ali said her children havent been to school for the past 2 days. Prior to speaking to Mrs. Ali, I checked Secure Case Search which revealed Mrs. Ali was granted a Temporary Protective Order against her husband, the final hearing is 1/18/23. Mrs. Ali confirmed this, however, she said the court refused to kick Mr. Ali out of the house or grant her full custody of the children. Mrs. Ali said they have two daughters, 4 and 7 years of age. Mrs. Ali confirmed she has spoken to and is working with Marcus from the Southern Maryland Center for Family Advocacy (SMCFA) in regards to divorce proceedings and child custody. I encouraged Mrs. Ali to stay in contact with SMCFA. I asked Mrs. Ali if she thought the children were safe, she told me they are, however, shes confident they are being brainwashed by her husband and mother-in-law. Mrs. Ali told me her husband took the car, I offered transportation to and from court, I provided Mrs. Ali with the barrack phone number. Mrs. Ali told me she did feel safe living at the home.</NarrativeText>
