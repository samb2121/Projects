         <NarrativeText>All events captured on my Axon Body Worn Camera.  Physical Evidence:     (36) Photographs of Calvert County Southern Middle School and Middleham Chapel submitted via Veripic.     (2) Witness Statements  Narrative:     On October 20, 2023, at approximately 2017 hours, I was on uniformed patrol in my marked Maryland State Police Unit U-13. I responded to Calvert County Southern Middle School, located at 9615 HG Trueman Rd, Lusby, Calvert County, MD, for trespass/malicious destruction of property.      Upon arriving on scene, I drove by the front of the school building and I observed a shattered glass window pane located at the front of the building. I also observed a shopping cart sitting under the damaged window. I then observed a male leaving the school premises on foot. I drove my patrol vehicle over to the male, who was now walking northbound in the southbound shoulder of HG Trueman Road.      I made contact with the suspect, later identified as Clay Thomas Arnold (O/M DOB: 01/19/1991), who was wearing a short sleeve shirt and sweatpants. Arnold had wet clothes and hair due to being outside in the rain. There was moderate rain during the previous several hours prior to making contact with Arnold. While speaking with Arnold, I observed blood on his forearms and fingers, and he seemed aggravated. I observed a bloody cut and broken glass particles on his left arm, consistent with injuries that broken glass causes. I asked Arnold what he was doing there, and he stated that the people in the school had wronged him. After inquiring about Arnolds injury and leaving the school premises, Arnold admitted that he had damaged the school building. Arnold stated that he carried cinder blocks in a shopping cart and threw the cinder blocks at a front glass window panel and the front door. Arnold admitted he damaged the property because people at the school had done him wrong. Arnold was unable to elaborate as to what that statement meant. Arnold stated his injuries were from the broken glass cutting him. Arnold advised he was the only person there and no one was with him.      At that time, I detained Arnold and requested an ambulance for his injuries. Emergency medical services personnel advised Arnold was in apparently good condition. They advised the cut on his arm had begun to scab and Arnold was not in need of any immediate medical attention at that time.      I placed Arnold under arrest for malicious destruction of property at 2015 hours, and read him his Miranda rights. Arnold invoked his right to remain silent. While en route to the detention center, I was advised by the Calvert County Communications Center that there was also damage to the front glass door panel at Middleham Chapel, located at 10210 HG Trueman Rd, Lusby, MD. The chapel is located directly next to Calvert County Southern Middle School. The front door glass panel had been damaged with a cinder block, consistent with the same item used to damage glass at the school. After completing a premise check of Middleham Chapel, Calvert County deputies advised me there was no one else in the area. Arnold was the only person in the area of the middle school and chapel. After listening to the message from dispatch regarding damage to Middleham Chapel, Arnold made no further statements regarding the incident. Arnold seemed to be in an altered mental state and continued to make incoherent statements. Arnold repeatedly stated that he was sick and tired of people and could no longer turn the other cheek. Arnold did not elaborate.      I transported Arnold to Calvert County Detention Center where he was charged with the following:  CR 6-301 **MAL DESTR PROP VALUE $1,000+** (Two counts) ED 26-102 **SCHOOL: TRESPASS ON GROUND**      On October 22, 2023m after Arnolds release from Calvert County Detention Center, he was transported to Calvert County Medical Health for an emergency petition. Arnold is currently being held on the psychiatric ward of Calvert Health.      Arnold was subsequently trespassed from Middleham Chapel, as well as every Calvert County public and private school building and property. On October 23, 2023, at approximately 2017 hours, I served Arnold the no trespass order.      The estimated value of the damage to the schools window and door was $5,000 to $10,000. The estimated value of damage to the chapels front glass door was $5,000.      Case closed by arrest.      All events occurred in Calvert County, MD.</NarrativeText>
