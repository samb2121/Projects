         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS: None  INTERVIEWED/VICTIM: BARTHOLOMEW POPE (Father) 6/30/72 STATEMENT: BARTHOLOMEW stated that he had been sitting in the living room of his residence reading a book on his phone, when his son, KHORAN, came downstairs and indicated that he wanted to fight him. BARTHOLOMEW stated that KHORAN began to charge at him and swing his fists at him. He is not sure/does not remember if any of the swings made contact. BARTHOLOMEW state that he immediately grabbed for KHORANS wrists in order to subdue him. After he was able to get hold of his wrists and a brief struggle, he brought KHORAN down to the ground and sat on top of his chest to further subdue him. BARTHOLOMEW stated that as the other members of the family heard the fight in the living room, they came downstairs and he instructed them to call 911. BARTHOLOMEW stated he was the only one in the living room when KHORAN came in and began to charge him,  In reference to the blood on his lip, BARTHOLOMEW stated that his lip had already been dry and split before the argument and that the blood may have come from him yelling with KHORAN, causing the lip to bleed again.  BARTHOLOMEW stated that KHORAN has never threatened him or anyone else in the family before, but KHORANS behavior had become more agitated in the last few days. BARTHOLOMEW stated that KHORAN has a history of mental issues/suicide attempts in the past. He also stated that due to KHORANS concerning behavior, he had just formally served KHORAN with an eviction notice earlier that day.  BARTHOLOMEW stated that because KHORAN was not being removed from the house this evening, he and the rest of the family were likely leaving for the night because they did not feel safe with KHORAN in the house.  INTERVIEWED/SUSPECT: KHORAN ZEINE POPE (Son) 2/2/93 STATEMENT: KHORAN initially wanted to provide very little information in regard to why he was pinned under his father when police arrived on scene and repeatedly stated that he was fine and everyone was fine. KHORAN also initially stated that he wished to not talk to me about anything that happened. Eventually, KHORAN admitted that he and his father had gotten into an argument earlier and that he became flustered. When asked about the cut/scrap I observed on his left pointer finger knuckle, KHORAN stated that it was from a fall. When asked if he wanted to harm himself, KHORAN stated no. When he asked if he wanted to harm anyone else, KHORAN stated no. KHORAN alluded to ongoing issues with his father. KHORAN stated that the argument never became physical.  INTERVIEWED/WITNESS: BRITTANY AMBER KRADLAK (Girlfriend) 4/28/01 STATEMENT: KRADLAK stated that she had been upstairs when she heard the fighting happening downstairs between the father of her child, KHORAN, and KHORANS father, BARTHOLOMEW. KRADLAK stated that when she came downstairs, she observed BARTHOLOMEW on top of KHORAN pinning him down. KRADLAK stated that she also sat on KHORANS legs to help restrain him as well, waiting for police arrival.  KRADLAK stated that KHORAN had indicated recently that he was upset with his father and wanted to assault/harm him. When asked if KHORAN was taking his medication as prescribed, she stated that he had been.  SCENE PROCESSING: Upon arrival, I observed an older larger male, later identified as BARTHOLOMEW, laying on top of a younger male, later identified as KHORAN, in the doorway between a living room and family room. BARTHOLOMEW was sitting on KHORANS abdomen and was pinning down both of KHORANS hands, above/to the side of KHORANS head. Both individuals were calm as I entered the residence. Upon my arrival, BARTHOLOMEW jumped off of KHORAN and walked in the kitchen. KHORAN indicated that he would be calm and was going to reach into his pocket to retrieve his vape. KHORAN then sat upright, with his legs crisscrossed in the large doorway that separated the rooms and spoke with me.  Immediately, I detected that KHORANS speech was thick and slurred and that he appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance. Based upon my training, knowledge and experience, and statements made by BARTHOLOMEW, I believe that KHORAN was heavily intoxicated from alcohol. While speaking with KHORAN, I observed a fresh red cut/scrape on the top of the pointer finger knuckle on his left hand. KHORAN stated that he got the cut from a fall. I believe KHORAN likely obtained the scarpe as he was being brought to the ground and struggling with his father, while the back of KHORANS hands/knuckles were pinned down on the ground. KHORAN initially tried to appear cooperative, but was largely uncooperative in his initial refusal to provide any information as to why he had been pinned under his father or any other details. Even when KHORAN did begin to provide any information, it was vague and short.  While speaking with the father, BARTHOLOMEW, I observed a split down the middle of his bottom lip and drying blood on the bottom and a little on the top lip. BARTHOLOMEW stated that the split was pre-existing before the argument and that the argument/yelling likely caused it to split and bleed again. I did not observe any other injuries on BARTHOLOMEW, who stated he does not recall any of KHORANS punches landing.  Also in the home, I observed an older female tending to a young infant, BARTHOLOMEW informed that was his wife and I learned the infant was the KRADLAK and KHORANS child. I also later observed another younger female, teenage aged, who BARTHOLOMEW stated was his daughter and who was the first one to call 911. Other than appearing tired and concerned, every other member of the family in the residence appeared to be in good health and unharmed. Based upon statements made by BARTHOLMEW and KRADLAK, none of the other family members were in the living room when the altercation occurred and only heard it from their respective bedrooms.  NARRATIVE: On 1/10/23 at approximately 2227 hours, I, TFC Meyers, was dispatched to 225 Diamond Dr Walkersville MD, for report of a domestic disturbance between a father and son. TFC Carter also advised he would be en route as well. Prior to my arrival, I was informed that the father had the son pinned but that things appeared to be calming down. Upon arrival, I was allowed into the home and observed a younger female, later identified as BRITTANY AMBER KRADLAK. Later on scene, KRADLAK provided the above statement. KRADLAK motioned that the altercation was in the next room. As I entered the living room, I observed a larger male sitting on top of a younger, smaller adult male. They were not actively assaulting one another or struggling. Both were calm. The larger male on top, later identified as BARTHOLOMEW POPE, hopped up off of the younger male. The younger male, later identified as KHORAN POPE, went on to provide the above statements. While initially speaking with KHORAN, TFC Carter arrived on scene as well. While speaking with KHORAN, I squatted down to his level and spoke in a calm, patient voice attempting to obtain information as to what happened. I continued this approach with KHORAN during my time there, in an attempt to have things remain calm on scene and to develop rapport with KHORAN and hopefully assist in obtaining information.  After TFC Carter arrived on scene, I requested he remain with KHORAN, who remained sitting on the floor of the doorway where he had been pinned, while I went and spoke with the larger male, BARTHOLOMEW. BARTHOLOMEW provided the above statement. While speaking with BARTHOLOMEW in the dining room, KRADLAK and BARTHOLOMEWS younger daughter informed me that KHORAN had indicated recently he wanted to assault his father, BARTHOLOMEW.  I again returned to KHORAN, who continued to provide little to no information about the incident, even after speaking with TFC Carter for a short time. Based upon the incident this evening, information provided to me about KHORANS past suicide attempts, I asked KHORAN if he wanted to harm himself or others. KHORAN was addiment that he did not wish to do either.  KHORAN continued to state that all he wanted to do was go down to his basement room, drink water, watch TV and go to sleep. Due to his calming demeanor, and based upon the evidence and statements I collected, I ultimately released KHORAN to go to his room, so I could calmly talk to BARTHOLOMEW and not have KHORAN attempt to agitate the situation again. Initially, BARTHOLOMEW seemed surprised/upset, that I was not removing KHORAN from the home. I went onto to explain the process in order to remove someone from their residence (Domestic assault/Emergency Petition criteria) and that as of tonight, KHORAN did not meet either one to be removed. BARTHOLOMEW stated that he understood, but stated that he and other members of the family were likely going somewhere else for the evening, as they did not feel safe. I went into detail with BARTHOLOMEW and strongly recommended going to obtain a protective order that night and advised him of the process of filing for criminal charges. BARTHOLOMEW initially stated that he wanted KHORAN charged, but toward the end of our interaction, he stated he no longer was interested in doing that.  While having this conversation with BARTHOLOMEW, KHORAN returned upstairs, stating he wished to obtain his phone charger. He then came in and sat back down on the couch in the living room, to face the dining room where I had been speaking to his father. I believe KHORAN did this because he wanted to listen to what his father was saying about him. Eventually, I was able to talk KHORAN back down to his bedroom, so I could continue to speak with his father. KHORAN was instructed to go to his bedroom and to be out of ear shot, as he had previously demonstrated that he wanted to hear what BARTHOLOMEW was saying and would yell and try and agitate the situation. TFC Carter stood guard by the basement door while he was down there.  At one point, BARTHOLOMEW went to get his phone, that he knew he had left in the living room. BARTHOLOMEW began to look in and around the couch that KHORAN had been seated on earlier when speaking with myself and TFC Carter. BARTHOLOMEW began to become concerned that KHORAN had taken his phone for some unknown reason. Using the ping feature on his Apple Watch, we began to hear the pinging of his phone coming from down in the basement where KHORAN was. KHORAN was instructed to return the phone to us, which he did through a dog/cat door in the closed basement door. I believe KHORAN did this solely to be antagonistic toward his father and not as an attempt at criminal theft.  Eventually, after speaking with BARTHOLOMEW and KRADLAK at length about their options and our strong recommendations, I went into the basement to speak with a now sleeping KHORAN again. KHORAN was provided information on filing for charges, as he had yelled up the steps earlier that he now wanted his father charged. KHORAN stated that he was no longer interested in that. KHORAN stated that he would no longer be an issue for police and that he just wanted to get rest. KHORAN was instructed multiple times to avoid contact with the rest of his family and given advice/instructions on how to handle heated arguments in the future. I later obtained a red handled knife from the ottoman that was next to where KHORAN was sleeping based upon information provided by KRADLAK. I informed KHORAN I was taking the knife upstairs for his and everyones safety and it would make everyone feel better. The knife was handed over to BARTHOLOMEW, who had begun to box up all the kitchen knives in the house, to put away, for everyones safety. BARTHOLOMEW was provided the case number on a victims right pamphlet.  TFC Carter and I then cleared the residence, but stopped a short distance away for a period of time, in the event the argument continued after we left. No other calls for service came from the residence up until the end of my shift.  All above events occurred in Frederick County, MD.  I request this case remain be suspended.</NarrativeText>
