         <NarrativeText>I-62 equipped with an in-car camera system. This interaction was not captured on In-Car camera. This interaction was captured on body camera.  Scene Processing: No scene processing was required for this case. All subjects involved in the verbal altercation were interviewed.  Physical Evidence: No physical evidence was obtained in this case.  Involved subject/ Complainant: Victor Lee Merritt (W/M, DOB: 03/04/1986)  Involved subject: Chontia Merritt (B/F, DOB: 03/05/1989)  Involved subject: Arianna Zhane Dunn (B/F, DOB: 02/22/2004)  Involved juvenile: Vivica Merritt (B/F, 03/03/2006)  Narrative:  On September 24, 2023, at approximately 1708 hours, I (TFC. Milich #6493) was dispatched to a residence located at 6209 Mill Road, Hurlock, Dorchester County, Maryland, for the report of a possible domestic dispute between a husband and wife. The husband was the complainant and stated that his wife tried o run him over with their vehicle.    I arrived on scene at approximately 1714 hours and made contact with the complainant who later identified himself by his Maryland drivers license as, Victor Lee Merritt (W/M, DOB: 03/04/1986). Merritt stated that his wife who was later identified as, Chontia Merritt (B/F, DOB: 03/05/1989) and her cousin who was later identified as, Arianna Zhane Dunn (B/F, DOB: 02/22/2004) were causing a disturbance at their residence and he got into a verbal argument with both of them. The verbal argument escalated into a scuffle within the residence involving the three of them and the couples juvenile 17-year-old daughter. The argument continued outside into the front yard of the residence. Mr. Merritt stated his wife and her cousin got into the familys vehicle and fled the scene. While backing out of the driveway, Mr. Merritt stated he reached into the van to get her stop and was partially dragged in the driveway. Mr. Merritt stated that was his own fault and shouldnt have done that and then he stood in front of the vehicle to prevent them from leaving. Mr. Merritt stated he knew he shouldnt have stood in front of the moving vehicle. Mr. Merritt stated that his wife has a drinking problem and was drinking alcohol throughout the day. Mr. Merritt had a small cut on his left hand, but was unsure where the cut came from.   A lookout was given to Hurlock Police Department for the couples white Dodge Grand Caravan. Officer Ishmael located the vehicle at the 110 block of North Main Street, Hurlock, Dorchester County, Maryland. Mrs. Merritt and Dunn were at that location and stated to Officer Ishmael that they were assaulted by Mr. Merritt. Mrs. Merritt stated that she was punched in the eye and was rubbing her left eye, However, I did not observe any signs of physical injury to Mrs. Merritt besides from where she was rubbing her eye. Dunn stated that Mr. Merritt punched her in her mouth. Dunn refused to talk with me and walked away from me when I was attempting to speak with her about the incident. After speaking with Mrs. Merritt she advised that she would be willing to stay with a family member for the evening to the keep the peace at the home. While speaking with Mrs. Merritt, I also detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her person.   I escorted Mrs. Merritt back to her residence to retrieve some of her belongings from her residence. Mrs. Merritt made several sarcastic comments out loud while retrieving her belongings. Mrs. Merritt retrieved her belongings without any incident. Mr. Merritt stated that he did not want Ms. Dunn back at his residence and that she was not welcome on his property.   While investigating this incident, I determined that Mrs. Merritt was the primary aggressor. I referred Mr. and Mrs. Merritt to the District Court Commissioners office for peace/ protective orders.    Case closed. No follow up investigation needed at this time.  All events occurred in Dorchester County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
