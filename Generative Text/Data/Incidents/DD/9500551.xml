         <NarrativeText>*This Incident Was Recorded On Body Worn Camera  Attachments: Witness Statement Lethality screening form Emergency Petition Form  Suspect:  Michael Eugene Stone Date of Birth: 11/18/1965  Victim:  Mary Elizabeth Heatherly Date of Birth: 02/05/1970  Scene Processing: Upon arrival, I made contact with the victim who advised that the suspect was still inside the residence collecting his belongings. Shortly after, I observed a white male subject coming out of the residence. I made contact with him and identified him by his Maryland drivers license as Michael Eugene Stone. Stone advised that he came home from a friends residence and got into a verbal altercation with Heatherly. He stated that he advised Heatherly to stay away from him and stop bothering him but Heatherly would not listen. While talking to me, Stone became emotional and visibly upset. He began walking away from me, at which time I grabbed his forearm and told him that he cannot walk away. He asked why, and I advised that he was detained pending an investigation of domestic violence. Stone became loud and increasingly upset. I asked Stone for consent to pat him down for weapons, to which he agreed. Stone emptied out his pocket and subsequently pulled down his pants exposing his private parts. Shortly after, Stone laid on the ground, all the while still visibly agitated. He stated that I wanted to get physical with him, at which time I explained to him that I grabbed his arm because he was walking away from me. Stone however refused to reason with me and continued on hurling obscenities. A short moment later, TFC Carr (#6935) arrived on scene. In an attempt to help Stone calm down, I asked TFC. Carr (#6935) to talk to him. I then made contact with Heatherly, who advised that Stone came home and got into a verbal altercation with her. She advised that Stone shoved her during the argument. I asked Heatherly if there were any physical injuries. She pulled up her shirts sleeve to show me when she was shoved at. I did not observe any physical injuries on Heatherly. Heatherlys grandson Russel also advised that he witnessed Stone shove Heatherly in the back.  Stone later began making suicidal threats. He grabbed a stick from the wood line and asked us to shoot him. He stated that he wanted to go be with his parents, who had recently passed away. He also stated that he was seeing demons. Stone is currently taking Oxycodone and percocet for pain. He advised that he used to be on psychiatric medication, but stopped seeing his psychiatrist.p Stone was later transported to the hospital for an emergency petition and medical evaluation after several minutes of trying to reason with him. Heatherly was put through a domestic violence lethality screening with the results of a high danger assessment. Heatherly was advised to call the domestic hotline at her own time due to bad cellular phone service in the rear at the time. Heatherly was also given a victims pamphlet advised of the resources available to her.  Narrative: On Thursday, June 15, 2023, at approximately 1234 hours, I responded to 11006 Wolfville Road, located in Frederick County, Maryland for a domestic dispute in progress.  Upon arrival, I made contact with the victim who advised that the suspect was still inside the residence collecting his belongings. Shortly after, I observed a white male subject coming out of the residence. I made contact with him and identified him by his Maryland drivers license as Michael Eugene Stone. Stone advised that he came home from a friends residence and got into a verbal altercation with Heatherly. He stated that he advised Heatherly to stay away from him and stop bothering him but Heatherly would not listen. While talking to me, Stone became emotional and visibly upset.

Heatherlys grandson Russel also advised that he witnessed Stone shove Heatherly in the back.  Stone later began making suicidal threats. He grabbed a stick from the wood line and asked us to shoot him. He stated that he wanted to go be with his parents, who had recently passed away. Stone was advised after paramedics arrived on scene that he needed to go to the hospital for emergency petition and medical evaluation. Stone refused to comply and stated numerous times that we would have to shoot him. He also stated that he was seeing demons. Stone is currently taking Oxycodone and percocet for pain. He advised that he used to be on psychiatric medication, but stopped seeing his psychiatrist. After several minutes of attempting to reason with Stone, he was transported to the hospital for an emergency petition and medical evaluation. Heatherly was put through a domestic violence lethality screening with the results of a high danger assessment. Heatherly was advised to call the domestic hotline at her own time due to bad cellular phone service in the area at the time. Heatherly was also given a victims pamphlet and advised of the resources available to her.  At approximately 1609 hours, I contacted Heartly House concerning the domestic dispute between Stone and Heatherly (Case number: 236589). I spoke to Emily (Domestic violence coordinator) about the incident and provided her with the case number, contact information for Heatherly, and the results of the Lethality screening.  All events occurred in Frederick County Maryland. I request this case closed by emergency petition.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText> On 6/28/2023, Heatherly returned my call and apologized for her being delayed in contacting me. I advised Heatherly of my reason for calling and provided her my information. I asked Heathrly if shes been doing well since the incident and she stated shes had no issues with the suspect in this case since the incident. Heatherly advised shes only been in contact with Stone once since the incident and it was okay. I asked Heatherly if she knew how to obtain a peace/protective order if she decides to in the future, and she advised she had the information on how to do so. Heatherly advised Stone is now staying at another location and she feels safe at this time. Heatherly thanked me for calling and appreciated my effort.  Case status: This concludes my portion of the investigation.</NarrativeText>
