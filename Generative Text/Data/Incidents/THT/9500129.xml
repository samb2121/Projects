         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-026487  Nature of Incident: Theft   Scene Processing: The interview was captured on my body worn camera with the victim. I collected one pair of female sunglasses that were left on the end table by the victims couch for fingerprinting.   Neighborhood Check: I made contact with Randy Smith, W/M, DOB: 05/08/1971 who lives at 3473 Littlestown Pike. Randy stated that he left for work at approximately 0630 hours and returned from work at approximately 1530 hours and stated that he did see anything. He stated that his wife was home on and off throughout the day but mostly gone. He does not have any type of security system on his house. I made contact with Edgar Tennant, W/M, DOB: 06/02/1951 who lives at 3463 Littlestown Pike. Edgar stated that he noticed a gentleman taking pictures of the residence next door that is up for sale which is located at 3467 Littlestown Pike but didnt think anything of it because he knew that they were real estate agents. Edgar said that there were a few other people at 3467 with the gentleman that he originally saw but they were all real estate agents. Edgar stated that he did not see anything out of the ordinary because he was not outside much.    Location: 3469 Littlestown Pike  Westminster, MD 21158   Victim: Robert George Smith, W/M, DOB: 09/25/1963 3469 Littlestown Pike, Westminster, MD 443-340-7862  Complainant Statement: Robert stated that when he got home from work he noticed a large amount of money that he had sitting on a chair by the kitchen table was missing. Robert stated that the money had been sitting there for approximately two months. He said that he was getting ready to put the money into the bank, but he just hasnt gotten around to doing it. Robert stated that the only thing that was taken was the money, but, nothing else was touched. Robert stated that the money was inside a plastic zip-lock bag. He also said that part of the other cash was in an envelope sitting on top of the kitchen table. The amount in the envelope was $4,000. Robert said that he noticed a pair of female sunglasses that were sitting on the end table by the two couches in his living room. He said that they were not there the day prior, and he does not know whose sunglasses they are. He said that no one besides his son has been in the house in months. Robert stated that he hangs out with some neighbors down the street that possibly knew that he had the money. Robert stated that he sold his race truck that was worth $100,000 to one of his neighbors for $26,000 and thats how he got the money. The amount that was stolen is $24,000 in US Currency. Robert stated that he primarily uses the back door as the entrance and exit. He stated that he leaves both his front and rear door unlocked because he has never had a problem for the 25 years that he has lived there. He said that he does not have a security system. Robert stated that he left for work around approximately 0540 hours and the money was there. Robert stated that he returned home from work at approximately 1715 hours. He said he did not notice that the money was missing until about 1800 hours. Robert stated that at that time he contacted the police.    Narrative:   On July 25, 2023, at approximately 1819 hours, I was dispatched to 3469 Littlestown Pike, Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland for the report of a theft. Upon arriving on scene, I made contact with Robert George Smith, W/M, DOB: 09/25/1963 and he provided the above statement. I captured photos of the living room where the sunglasses were located which will be uploaded to the report. I collected the sunglasses for fingerprinting and recorded them on a Maryland State Police Form 67 Chain of Custody.   All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.   I request this case be forwarded to Criminal Enforcement Division for further investigation. </NarrativeText>
