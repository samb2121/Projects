         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-018623  Nature of Incident: CR 7-104 THEFT: $100 TO UNDER $1,500 Eight (8) Maryland 633 Hot 777 Lottery Tickets (Serial #020725-001 through #020725-008) Value of Tickets: $160 Value of Winnings: $190  Attachments: Maryland State Lottery  Gaming Control AgencyTicket History MSP Form 67 Chain of Custody Copies of Emails Received from Sheetz Inc with Hyperlinks to Requested Evidence Lottery Ticket Log  Defendant: Jessica Lee Green Uknown Address W/F 3/9/1990  Complainant and Location: Faith Breno Vanessas Corner Pub 2600 Liberty Road, Westminster, MD 21157  Complainant Statement:   On 5/25/2023 at approximately 1153 hours, I, TFC Nield #6851, responded toVanessas Corner Pub (2600 Liberty Road, Westminster, MD 21157) for a reported theft of lottery tickets. I arrived on scene and made contact with Faith Breno, the Vice President of Operations and Accounting for Vanessas Corner Pub. Breno explained that on 4/25/2023, Vanessas Corner Pub received pack #20725 which contained thirty (30) Maryland 633 Hot 777 Lottery Tickets which were all activated for sale that day at approximately 1324 hours. Breno explained that the sale price of each ticket was $20. Breno then explained that Vanessas Corner Pub would sell their lottery tickets starting with the highest number (#30) in the packet and would sell them in descending order until the packet was exhausted. I asked Breno how she knew which tickets were sold on which day and she answered that her employees were required to note the current ticket number at the beginning of the shift and at the end of the shift. Breno then continued, stating that on 5/20/2023, Ticket #9 was sold and the employees observed that tickets #1-#8 were missing from the package.  Breno then informed me that she called Maryland State Lottery  Gaming Control Agency to ask about tickets #1-#8. TheMaryland State Lottery  Gaming Control Agency told her that tickets #1, #3, and #5 were all determined to be winners and had been scanned at the Sheetz retail store #652, located at 1023 Baltimore Boulevard, Westminster Maryland on 5/2/2023 at approximately 2308 hours. Breno then provided me the names of the employees who had access to the area where the lottery tickets were kept and were working on 5/2/2023. The first employee was Jordyn Thayer (W/F 8/23/2004) and the second was Jessica Green (W/F 3/9/1990). I asked Breno if Vanessas Corner Pub had surveillance footage at the date and time of the alleged thefts, to which she stated that they did not. I asked Breno how she knew that the lottery tickets had not been paid for, and she answered that all income from lottery tickets were kept in a separate portion of the restaurant which verified weekly to ensure that the income matches the number of tickets sold. Breno stated that she was short $160 when they noticed the tickets were missing.  Narrative:  On 5/25/2023 at approximately 1153 hours, I, TFC Nield #6851, responded toVanessas Corner Pub (2600 Liberty Road, Westminster, MD 21157) for a reported theft of lottery tickets. I arrived on scene and made contact with Faith Breno, the Vice President of Operations and Accounting for Vanessas Corner Puband took her statement.  I then responded to the Westminster Sheetz (1023 Baltimore Boulevard, Westminster Maryland) and made contact with the on-duty manager. I asked the manager to view the surveillance footage of 5/2/2023 at approximately 2308 hours, which she allowed me to view. On the surveillance footage at the specified time, I observed a white female enter the store, walk to the lottery machine, and scan six (6) gold tickets that matched the description ofMaryland 633 Hot 777lottery tickets. The woman then took the cash voucher from the lottery machine and went to the point of sale. The Sheetz manager then explained that Sheetz had not redeemed the cash voucher that night because they do not redeem lottery cash vouchers after 2300 hours. The woman is then seen exiting the store. I asked the Sheetz manager how to obtain a copy of the surveillance footage, and she explained that all surveillance records would have to be received directly from the Sheetz Inc cooperate office. The manager then explained the process for receiving those records and I left the required information with the manager.  I then went to the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack and called theMaryland State Lottery  Gaming Control Agency and explained the details of the investigation. Investigator Jones of theMaryland State Lottery  Gaming Control Agency then provided me with a workup of the eight (8) missing lottery tickets. This workup detailed that the Westminster Sheetz had the retailer ID #94779505 and that Vanessas Corner Pub had the retailer ID #4259101. These retail ID numbers also displayed which tickets were scanned at which retail location. The workup also detailed that the following information about the winning status of each ticket:   Ticket #8: Winning Ticket - Amount: $20.00 - Scanned at Vanessas Corner Pub on 5/4/2023 at 2125 hours  Ticket #7: Not a Winner - Scanned at Vanessas Corner Pub on 5/4/2023 at 2135 hours  Ticket #6: Not a Winner - Scanned at Sheetz on 5/2/2023 at 2309 hours  Ticket #5: Winning Ticket - Amount: $50.00- Scanned at Sheetz on 5/2/2023 at 2309 hours  Ticket #4: Not a Winner- Scanned at Sheetz on 5/2/2023 at 2309 hours  Ticket #3: Winning Ticket - Amount: $100.00- Scanned at Sheetz on 5/2/2023 at 2308hours  Ticket #2: Not a Winner- Scanned at Sheetz on 5/2/2023 at 2308hours  Ticket #1: Winning Ticket - Amount:$20.00- Scanned at Sheetz on 5/2/2023 at 2308hours    The workup also detailed that on 5/2/2023 at 2309 hours, the white female at Sheetz was given a Player Activated Terminal Voucher for the cash amount of $170,00. This Terminal Voucher would be redeemed for the cash winnings on 5/3/2023 at 1712 hours at Vanessas Corner Pub.  Follow-Up Investigations:    On 6/9/2023 at approximately 1116 hours, I received an email from Sheetz Inc with instructions on how to view the requested surveillance footage. On the footage, I was able to again observe the white female enter the store and scan the lottery tickets. Using the time stamps, I was able to rewind the footage and find the vehicle that the white female arrived to Sheetz in. At approximately 1106 hours, a red Toyota passenger car displaying Maryland registration 3EX4189 enters the western entrance of Sheetz. A routine METERS check of this vehicle revealed that it was registered to Jessica Lee Green (W/F 3/9/1990) of Westminster Maryland. The driver of the vehicle was the same white female who entered the store and scanned the tickets.  On 6/17/2023 at approximately 1000 hours, I returned to Vanessas Corner Pub and made contact with Breno. I showed Breno the surveillance footage that I had obtained from Sheetz, and she was able to positively identify the white female in the footage as Jessica Green.  On 6/17/2023, I submitted an Application for Charges to the District Court Commissioner for Carroll County. A criminal summons was then issued for Jessica Green for the charge of Theft $100 to Under $1500.  On 6/18/2023 at approximately 0700 hours, I attempted to serve the criminal summons at Greens last known address, but was unsuccessful in making contact.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.  I request this case remain open pending the service of the summons or potential arrest warrant.   </NarrativeText>
