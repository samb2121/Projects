         <NarrativeText>Type of Report: Theft  Attachments: Brief Work-Up of Barnes Transaction History, Actual Transactions from RAPID and LeadsOnline Platform.   NARRATIVE:  On April 3, 2023 I was contacted by 1st Sergeant J. Hass of the Maryland State Police Regional Automated Property Information Database (RAPID) Unit in reference to an individual pawning large quantities of items at pawn shops in the Laurel, Maryland area. 1st Sergeant Haas advised he received aRAPID Notice 202302-00035 for the time frame of August 19, 2022 to February 11, 2023. He told me that thefemale, who I later identified as Britany Inez Barnes (dob08/17/1990),had complete 41 separate pawn transactions. A variety of the items pawned consist of cuisine appliances, electronics and power tools listed as New-In-Box (NIB). She has received over $15,000.00 during this6-month period.  On April 5, 2023 at approximately 0900 hours, I began to personally investigate the transactions that 1st Sgt. Haas has mentioned and also discovered that from February 11, 2023 to March 31, 2023 Barnes had completed 8 separate pawn transactions. Mostly consisting of NIB items. Barnes has received $4,335.00 during this 7-week time period.I then attempted to complete a work-up of Barnes transaction history (any trends, patterns, consistencies).  ***Refer to Attachment Section of Report for Brief Work-Up of Barnes Transaction History***  I found that Barnes conducts her pawn transactions every 4 to 9 days (the average is 5 to 6 days in between). Barnes also pawns her items occasionally on Mondays or Tuesdays, but more frequently goes to the pawn shops on Fridays and Saturdays. The average time of day she completes her transactions are between 1300 hours and 1900 hours. Barnes has not made a transaction at a pawn shop during the morning hours of the day, it has always been during the afternoon/evening hours. Barnes residence listed on her Maryland drivers license is approximately 18.4 miles away from the pawn shop she has been completing her transactions at since August 2022, which is listed as Best Pawn (10051 N. 2nd Street Laurel, Maryland 20708). Barnes made only one transaction at a separate pawn shop since August 2022, which was listed as Super Pawn (10119 Washington Blvd. N. Laurel, MD 20723).  ***Refer to Barnes Transaction History from the LeadsOnline and RAPID Platform***  On April 5, 2023 at approximately 1536 hours Barnes completed another transaction at Best Pawn in Laurel, Maryland. This transaction made 9 total transactions since February 11, 2023, bringing the total U.S. Currency amount of pawned items since February 11, 2023 to $4,835.00.  I respectfully request this case remain open pending further investigation.  All events occurred in the Howard County, Maryland area.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>I conducted in-person surveillance of 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042 on April 11, 2023, and April 18, 2023. Due to the landscape and area where Barnes residence is located, it was very difficult to do so without being seen. With this investigative issue, I requested a Pole Camera be installed to conduct surveillance of the residence. On May 11, 2023, a Pole Camera was installed to surveil the front entrance of 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042. After installation, I began to review the footage daily. Due to the limited view of only the very front entrance, I was able to observe Barnes driving a vehicle, which I later identified as a tan 2002 Toyota Tundra bearing Maryland registration A059787. The tan 2002 Toyota Tundra has a large decal of a Ravens Football Helmet on the tailgate of the truck.  Barnes was positively observed driving the tan Toyota Tundra on the following dates at Barnes residence: 1. 05/11/2023 at approximately 1537 hours 2. 05/20/2023 at approximately 1805 hours 3. 05/22/2023 at approximately 1451 hours 4. 05/22/2023 at approximately 1536 hours  After observing Barnes driving the tan Toyota Tundra at her residence, I then requested the Pole Camera be moved to the Best Pawn located at10051 N 2nd St,Laurel, MD 20723. On May 30, 2023, the Pole Camera was moved to the Best Pawn in Laurel, MD. After the Pole Camera was installed to conduct surveillance at the Best pawn, I received a RAPID notification that Barnes completed a pawn transaction on 05/31/2023 at approximately 1337 hours. I reviewed the video footage for 05/31/2023 and observed a tan Toyota Tundra pull into the parking lot of the Best Pawn at approximately 1321 hours. The Toyota Tundra then backed into a parking space near the front entrance of the Best Pawn. A female, who I identified as Barnes exited the drivers side of the pickup truck and walked to the rear of the truck. Barnes then opened the back hatch of the cap that is covering the bed of the truck. Barnes retrieved numerous items and walked into the Best Pawn. Barnes then exited the Best Pawn store a short time later with no items in her hands. Barnes then left the parking lot.  ***It is to be noted that Barnes has been stopped, by law enforcement personnel, in the tan 2002 Toyota Tundra prior to this case being assigned. Barnes was stopped on a traffic stop by law enforcement on the following dates: 1. 05/28/2009 at westbound US Rt. 50 near the 37.6 mile marker in Queen Annes County, MD- Maryland Transportation Authority 2. 03/14/2011 at Cedar Lane near Little Patuxent Pkwy in Columbia, MD- Howard County Police Department  I have also requested a subpoena through the Howard County States Attorneys Office and Clerk of the Circuit Court for Howard County, MD. for Barnes cellular phone records as well as a subpoena through Block Inc. for information pertaining to Barnes Cash App Account.  Since the last reported follow-up in RMS, April 7, 2023, Barnes has conducted 10 pawn transactions. Since April 7, 2023, the total U.S. Currency amount of pawned items Barnes has received is $4,300.00.  I respectfully request this case remain open, pending further investigation.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>EXECUTION OF SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT:  On August 15, 2023, at approximately 1053 hours, members of the Maryland State Police RAPID Unit served a court authorized vehicle search and seizure warrant, on a tan 2002 Toyota Tundra bearing Maryland registration A059787, at 1326 Londontown Boulevard Eldersburg, Carroll County, Maryland 21784, this is also the business of The Home Depot. The search and seizure warrant also included the person of BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990). The main target of the investigation, BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) was observed walking out of The Home Depot store and into the parking lot after being notified and were in constant communication with asset protection personnel from The Home Depot. The asset protection personnel advised that BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) was pushing an orange flat cart and had on it a large trash can, and approximately two bags of mulch. They also advised that BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) had walked past all points of sale without paying for any of the merchandise.  After speaking with the asset protection personnel, I physically observed BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) walking towards the vehicle she primarily operated, which was the tan 2002 Toyota Tundra bearing Maryland registration A059787. The vehicle was parked in front of The Home Depot front entrance near the Garden Center. BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) continued to walk across The Home Depot parking lot and ultimately to the rear of the tan 2002 Toyota Tundra bearing Maryland registration A059787. BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) was then observed attempting to load the large trash can into the bed of the vehicle. Due to what appeared an issue of weight, BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) was then forced to begin unloading the contents inside the trash by hand into her vehicle.  After BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) unloaded the first unpaid item into her vehicle, the RAPID Unit made contact with BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990). When contact was made with BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990), she immediately began to shake uncontrollably and placed her head down. I began to speak with BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) and asked her if she knew why we were there that day. Very quickly BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) stated I know, I did it. Due to the immediate reaction and statement, I retrieved my MSP Form 180 Advice of Miranda Rights. I read each line of the form in its entirety and had her initial next to each Right that was read. I then had BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) sign the form at the bottom. BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) then agreed to waive her rights that were read to her and agreed to speak to me freely. I asked BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) again why we were there that morning. She again stated I know what I did, I did it I then asked her if she was able to provide any documentation to prove that she paid for the items that were on the orange cart. BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) told me that she could not and that she was worried about her child that was at her house. I did attempt numerous times to calm her nerves, but she continued to cry. I then began photographing the scene near the truck. I had BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) step to the rear of the vehicle. I photographed the following items on the orange cart and inside the vehicle:  1. One Kohler Sous faucet, R10651- SD BL, matte black (Inside trash bin) 2. Two Kohler Capilano faucets, R24214- SD V5, nickel plated (Inside trash bin) 3. One Ryobi 40-volt combo-kit, RY40209 (Inside trash bin) 4. One black Tote 55-gallon trash bin (On orange cart) 5. One Everbilt submersible well pump,  horsepower #2581 (On the rear passenger seat of the vehicle) 6. Two bags of Scotts Earth Grow brown mulch (On orange cart)  7. Two Rustoleum spray paint cans, brown and green (Inside trash bin) 8. One Rejuvenate Soap scum remover (In plastic bag inside trash bin) 9. One Clorox Bleach bathroom cleaner. 30 oz. (In plastic bag inside trash bin) 10. One tool-box brand professional white rags (In plastic bag inside trash bin) 11. One HDX dust mop refills (In plastic bag inside trash bin) 12. One HDX latex gloves, 2 pack (In plastic bag inside trash bin) 13. One Everbilt disposable flash guard (Inside trash bin)  ***Total value of items seized at The Home Depot on 08/15/2023 was $2,030.83*** ***Refer to photographs of the scene and evidence at The Home Depot parking lot labeled Evidence At The Home Depot***  After photographing the items where they were, we moved the evidence processing and searching of the vehicle to the side of The Home Depot parking lot, so as to not embarrass BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) nor draw attention to what was occurring.  While on the side parking lot, the search warrant for the vehicle was read in full to BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990). After the vehicle search was read and explained, I then secured the vehicle in the parking lot of The Home Depot, returned the property at the scene to The Home Depot asset Protection personnel and transported BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) back to the residence of 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042. (At no time was Barnes placed in handcuffs during our interaction in The Home Depot parking lot, transporting Barnes back to 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042, and also while at 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042.)  While transporting BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) back to the residence, I began to ask BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) questions relating to the case at hand. I asked her why she stole for the period of over one year from the various Big-Box stores, such as Kohls, The Home Depot, Walmart. She advised that she did it to help her parents pay the mortgage for the house, utilities, and other expenses. Barnes told me that her mother, Joy Lee Goldsmith is on disability and that her father only collects social security so it isnt enough to pay for everything. I asked Barnes if she suffers from any drug addiction. Barnes told me that she does not. Barnes advised that while she was a bartender a few years back she would do a bump just to get her through her shift. I knew through my training, knowledge, and experience that the term bump is referred to a small amount of cocaine being snorted. I then asked Barnes if she could clarify what she meant by the phrase bump. She stated you know just enough coke to get me through the night I then asked her if she thought she was addicted to cocaine. Barnes then told me that she was not. I then asked Barnes if while she was committing the thefts at the various stores, if she ever got an adrenaline rush from it. Barnes hesitated and then told me that she did. She told me that she would like the feeling of not getting caught. I also asked Barnes if she ever thought about the actual monetary value that she stole from the Big-Box stores. Barnes told me that she would go to the Best Pawn in Laurel, Howard County, Maryland and would get about $40.00 to 60.00 on average for a tool or item. I then advised Barnes that was not the actual value of the tool or item. I told her that based off of her RAPID transaction log from June 4, 2023 to August 15, 2023 she received approximately $33,000.00 from the Best Pawn for the merchandise she brought in. I then advised her that since the pawn shop only gives her a small percentage of what the item is actually valued at, she has stolen well over $100,000 in the merchandises actual value from the stores. Barnes then told me that she feels stupid because in reality she was the one stealing and has only gotten little compensation of what the item is actually worth. I then asked Barnes about the child that was seen with her while she would commit the thefts. Barnes told me that the child was hers and that sometimes she was unable to find someone to watch him so she would take him with her. After speaking with Barnes in reference to the thefts, we arrived at 13304 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042.  Myself and members of the Maryland State Police RAPID Unit executed the court authorized Search and Seizure warrant for the residence. We approached the front of the residence with BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990). We knocked on the front door and after approximately 10 seconds the door was opened by an adult male and all occupants were called to the living room area of the residence. Located within the residence was Stanley Barton Barnes, Britany Barnes father, Joy Lee Goldsmith, Britany Barnes mother, and one juvenile. All subjects were detained without incident. All occupants were cooperative.   Once the residence was cleared and deemed safe, the residence was videoed, photographed, and documented. As a result of the search and seizure warrant of the residence located at 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042, a thorough search was conducted, andthe following evidence was recovered and seized due to BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) admitting that the items were in fact stolen:  Item # 1: One black and yellow tote / large storage box / plastic (Located outside in the driveway of residence)  Item # 2: One Ryobi 18-volt fan, #P3320, Serial Number #AS21015D037318 (Located in attached garage)   Item # 3: One Ryobi 18-volt vacuum, #PBLSV717, Serial Number #CS220055D708168 (Located in BRITANY INEZ BARNES (W/F, 8/17/1990) bedroom closet)  Item # 4: One Ryobi 18-volt chainsaw, P5452, Serial Number #EU21292D020132 (Located in attached garage)          Item # 5: One Ryobi 18-volt pressure washer, #RY121850VNM, Serial Number #RG22085D020164 (Located in attached garage)          Item # 6: One Ryobi 18-volt hedge trimmer, #P2900VNM, Serial Number #LT21105D060078 (Located in attached garage)          Item # 7: One Ryobi 18-volt hand vacuum, #PCL702, Serial Number #AS22083D283623 (Located in attached garage)          Item #8: One Ryobi 18-volt small hand pressure washer, #PSP01, Serial Number #CS20373DC30453 (Located in attached garage)          Item #9  One Ryobi 18-volt Air Compressor, #P737D, Serial Number #0Q22281D0129383 (Located in attached garage)          Item #10  One Ryobi 18-volt clip on light, PC1665, Serial Number #0P22508D003583 (Located on back porch of residence)          Item #11  One Ryobi 18-volt portable power pack/bank, #RYI150BGVNM, Serial Number #MZ21221D090527 (Located in attached garage)          Item #12  Five Ryobi 18-volt chargers with the following P #s: (Located in the attached garage)   P118B  PC6002  PC6002  P118B  P118B           Item #13  Eight Ryobi 18-volt lithium batteries with the following P #s: (Located in the attached garage)     margin-left:8px"&gt;PBP003   margin-left:8px"&gt;PBP004   margin-left:8px"&gt;P189   margin-left:8px"&gt;P189   margin-left:8px"&gt;PBP005   margin-left:8px"&gt;PBP005   margin-left:8px"&gt;PBP005   margin-left:8px"&gt;PBP005   Item #14  One Ryobi 18-volt cordless string trimmer, #P2003VNM, Serial Number #LT21354N190038 (Located in attached garage with a box matching item)  Item #15 - Mail addressed to Britany Inez Barnes  located in a mail holder in the kitchen         Item #16  One Ryobi EZ Clean Power Cleaner 42 extension wand, Model #RY3112EP, New-In-Box (Located in the attached garage)           Item #17 - One Ryobi 5 pack .080 single line and spool auto feed string (New-In-Package and located in the attached garage)    The following items were not seized from the residence due to the size of them and also The Home Depot just requested restitution:         Item #18  7 additional 70 gallon black totes with red and yellow lids / large storage box / plastic (Located outside in the driveway of residence as well as garage and basement) $59.98 each         Item #19  2 additional 55 gallon black totes with red and yellow lids / storage box / plastic (Located outside in the driveway of residence as well as basement) $39.98 each         Item #20  3 additional 38 gallon black totes with red and yellow lids / storage box / plastic (Located outside in the driveway of residence as well as basement) $29.98 each         Item #21 - 3 additional 27 gallon black totes with red and yellow lids / storage box / plastic (Located outside in the driveway of residence as well as basement) $11.98 each         Item #22 - 4 additional 12 gallon black totes / storage box / plastic (Located outside in the driveway of residence as well as garage and basement) $9.98 each    ***Total value of items seized at 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042 was $2,741.92*** ***Refer to photographs of residence and evidence in Attachments Section labeled Evidence At Residence***    All of the items that were located at the residence of 13394 Folly Quarter Road Ellicott City, Maryland 21042 were transported back to the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack.

         <NarrativeText>SUPPLEMENT:    On August 15, 2023, I, Corporal Jean L. Davenport #4718, MSP PCSD/RAPID Unit, assisted with execution of Search and Seizure Warrants reference this case.    While at the suspects residence located at 13394 Folly Quarter Road, Ellicott City, MD 21042, I was responsible for securing family members in the front living room area. I read the Search and Seizure Warrant to the occupants present in the room to include, Britany Barnes, Stanley Barnes, and Joy Goldsmith; also in the room was Barnes five (5) year old son. Later, after moving to the kitchen for the family to make lunch, I had an opportunity to be alone with Joy who stated she knew something was going on with Britany, and knew she was up to something because she had not worked in a long time. I asked Joy if Britany helped pay the bills and Joy denied Britany had contributed anything toward the family finances in several months. She stated her and Stanley have enough income between them to pay the mortgage and Britany does not contribute money to pay the mortgage.    Joy stated that Britany has taken credit cards out in Stans name and used her (Joys) Social Security Number to get prescription medication. Joy said she reported this incident to Howard County Police who took a report, but not charges were ever filed.     Britany stated she took some of Joys prescription meds but had advised Joy she was taking them for a headache. Joy denied knowledge of Britany asking for her prescription medication. Joy wants Britany to move out of her house and wants custody of their five (5) year old grandson.  Case closed.</NarrativeText>
