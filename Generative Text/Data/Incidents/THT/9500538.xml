         <NarrativeText>CASE NUMBER: 23-MSP-022882  INVESTIGATOR: Trooper First Class M. Mowbray #7119 NATURE OF INCIDENT: Theft SCENE PROCESSING: Scene processing was conducted with the following results;    margin-left:8px"&gt;One (1) copy of email from Coinbase  INCIDENT FOOTAGE:  INCIDENT CAPTURED BY BODY WORN CAMERA TFC M. Mowbray #7119 Body Worn Camera: partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline"&gt;https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=74be02b7b6534967acba3bea3bc26624partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  NARRATIVE: On July 25, 2023, at approximately 2058 hours I, Trooper First Class M. Mowbray #7119 of the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, was dispatched to 101 Main Street, Unit 101, Secretary, Dorchester County, Maryland, in regards to a theft report.  Upon my arrival I made contact with the complainant; identified by Maryland drivers license as John Anthony DeGrace (DOB: 07/02/1951) [hereinafter identified as DeGrace]. During the interview with DeGrace, he advised that an estimated $100,000 worth of his investments in Coinbase had been withdrawn from his Coinbase vault. DeGrace advised that on June 21, 2023, he received a notice from Coinbase that suspicious activity had been noticed within his account.   DeGrace advised that while attempting to move funds from his vault to his wallet he noticed something suspicious on his account while using the two-step verification process. DeGrace immediately notified Coinbase of the fraudulent activity and requested that they launch an investigation in an attempt to be reimbursed.  DeGrace advised that for the suspects to access his account, they would have to have access to his two (2) email addresses to conduct withdraws. DeGrace advised the two email addresses are;  text-decoration:underline"&gt;degracejohn@comcast.net  text-decoration:underline"&gt;johndegrace121@gmail.com  DeGrace advised that he also received an email from Comcast, suggesting that he change his email password due to activity within his email account. DeGrace stated that his email account was also compromised during this process.   On June 25, 2023, at 1415 hours, DeGrace received an email from Coinbase advising him that their records indicated that on June 21, 2023, between 1019 hours and 1030 hours, his account was accessed by a Windows 10 device with an IP address of 170.250.114.11 out of Miami, Florida. The email also provided details on the transactions made by the suspects. The copy of the email has been attached to this report.According to the report several withdraws of funds calculated to $74,114.95 were taken from the account on June 21, 2023. The remainder of the transactions were in methods not measured in U.S. currency.   I conducted a check of the IP address and confirmed it to originate from Miami, Florida with no confirmed location coordinates.  DeGrace estimated the amount of loss at $100,000 in U.S. currency.   I provided DeGrace with the Maryland State Police case number as well as Maryland Crime Victims and Witnesses pamphlet while on scene.  Since taking the initial report from Mr. DeGrace, he has provided updates from Coinbase on their investigation into this matter.  On July 29, 2023, DeGrace advised that he was able to regain access to his Coinbase account and recover the remaining crypto currency in his account. DeGrace also stated, however, that the $70,000 loss was not included in what was recovered but estimated those funds to be Ethereum.  On August 6, 2023, DeGrace provided a file of an account statement from Coinbase. He did note that the email address listed ( text-decoration:underline"&gt;richerlarry81@gmail.com) was not his email address and could be the suspects email address. The sixty-four (64) page document includes the transactions on June 21, 2023. DeGrace stated following via email; Any item marked you sold or you withdrew funds on 6-21-23 were not authorized my me. Ditto for you sent, you recieved or you purchased including the $73075.96 US Dollars and same amount ETH sold. Also note the entry you sent Ethereum to 40.34279232 ETH 2 in the amt of $75,377.88USD. That amount represents total lost dollars in this theft. Tks. John DeGrace.  I respectfully request the case remain open pending further investigation.   All events occurred in Dorchester County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
