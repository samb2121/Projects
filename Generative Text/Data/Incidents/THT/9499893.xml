         <NarrativeText>The below incident was captured on Axon body worn camera.  Narrative: On May 2, 2023, at approximately 1745 hours, I was dispatched to the Hampstead Walmart located at 2320 N. Hanover Pike, Hampstead, MD 21074 for the report of a theft that had already occurred.  On scene, I made contact with asset protection investigator Michael Schuldt who advised that a black male came to Walmart to get an oil change and a new tire put on his vehicle. Schuldt advised that the male was identified as Joseph Ekwutife (B/M DOB: 5/25/80) and his vehicle was identified as a black Toyota Camry bearing Maryland registration 4EZW18. Schuldt advised that once the service was completed Ekwutife attempted to pay for the service however it appeared he was unable to locate an associate to check out. Schudlt provided video surveillance ofEkwutife walking to the front of the store and speaking with customer service and then walking back to the automotive section of the store. Finally, Schuldt advised thatEkwutife is seen on surveillance obtaining a spare key for his vehicle from an unknown subject who drove to the rear parking lot of the store. Schuldt proceeded to state thatEkwutife gets in his vehicle and leaves the store without paying for the mechanical work. Schuldt provided me with the original key to the Toyota. Schuldt also provided me with video surveillance which was package and store per MSP policy.  I respond toEkwutifes address, 2504 Highcrest Ct. Manchester, MD 21102. I made contact with CynthiaEkwutife who stated ther her husband was at work but would call him so I could speak to him.Ekwutife stated that he wanted to pay for the service however he could not find anyone to check him out for 45 minutes. He stated that he needed to get to work, so his wife drove him the spare key, and he left. He stated that he plans on returning to the store to pay for the service when he has time later this week. I provided CynthiaEkwutife with the original Toyota key.  On May 3, 2023, I received a phone call at the Westminster Barrack from Walmart Manager Luke Moya who advised thatEkwutife had paid for the service, and they did not want to press charges anymore considering they provided such poor customer service toEkwutife.  I respectfully request this case be CLOSED due to the lack of prosecution. </NarrativeText>
