         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING:    Digital photographs were taken of both barns where the property was stolen from and uploaded to VeriPic according to MSP policy. A written statement was obtained from the former employee who worked for Salem School and identified all items that were stolen.   NARRATIVE:    On February 18, 2023, the McHenry Barrack received an anonymous tip from a subject who stated she believed items were being stolen from the school. The anonymous caller said she heard a rumor from an unknown source that a zero turn mower, a saw and a generator were stolen from the school and the times were currently being kept at their brother in laws fathers house.   On February 18, 2023, at 2048 hours, I responded up to the school where I made contact with the president of the school who was identified as Matthew David Eichhorn (12/18/1971) and the Human Resource Director identified as Justin Allen Lam (12/08/1982). I advised both parties that there was a possible theft of three items that were taken from the school by a James Franklin Green (05/11/1979). Both parties advised me that Green is a current employee of the school and did maintenance on the property. Lam provided me with depreciation expense form with all items that the school purchased. Both Lam and Eichhorn were unsure where the three items would be kept due to them working at the main school. A call was made to a former employee identified as Robert Allen Fischetti (02/21/1951) to inquire on the whereabouts of where the property was kept. Fischetti advised that the zero turn mower should have been in the barn below the maintenance shed and the Generator and saw should have been in the maintenance shed. Both Lam and Eichhorn said no one had permission to take property from the school.    Myself, Lam and Eichhorn made our way to both barns located out behind the school. Lam unlocked the barn and opened the door to visually inspect the barn where the mower should be located. I checked the barn and was not there. I obtained pictures from inside the barn where the mower was located. I also noticed vehicle tracks that were in the dew of the grass that were leading up to the barn. We then left the barn and went up to the maintenance shed to check to see of the generator and saw were missing.    Several attempts were made to make entry into the maintenance shed, however, Lam did not have the proper keys to enter the building to verify if the generator and saw were taken. Both parties were provided an incident number due to being unable to positively identify the mower and not having the items on the depreciation expense form to show ownership. I advised Lam and Eichhorn I would respond back to the school the following day to investigate further. The anonymous caller was contacted to see if she could obtain pictures of the generator and saw to forward to the McHenry Barrack for identifying purposes. The caller advised she would go back to the property on Sunday, February 19, to take pictures of the items.    On February 19, 2023, Lam called back to the barrack and advised that all property was returned to the sheds. Lam advised me that Green texted him and said he was holding onto the mower for safe keeping to sharpen the blades and change the oil in the mower and returned it back to the barn. Several calls were made to the tipster to see if they could provide the pictures, however, they did not answer. A call was made to the Christian Mash and was advised of the situation. Mash advised due to the circumstances and the property being returned to Salem School no charges would be filed.     Later in the evening the tipster called back to the barrack and said they were able to obtain pictures of the generator and saw which they forwarded to the barrack. The photos were then forwarded to Eichhorn to show Fischetti for identifying purposes. Eichhorn said Fischetti does not have email, so he would show Fischetti on Monday, February 20th.   Eichhorn called into the barrack on February 20, 2023, and advised that Fischetti positively identified the generator and saw to belong to Salem School. I responded back to Salem School where I made contact with Fischetti, Eichhorn and Lam. Lam led me into the maintenance shed where the property was kept. It was found that Fischetti was able to confirm that five other items were taken and provided me a list of the items and where they were located in the maintenance shed. See below  Power porter cable 10,000 watt generator Generac generator X68000 Mitsubishi generator Stihl model 26 chainsaw Hitachi miter saw Propane ceiling fan Schumaker portable battery charger.    It can be known they had no serial numbers or identifying features on all the property.    Fischetti also provided me a written statement verifying all property that he listed was taken from the Salem School and placed into the case file for safe keeping.    Sgt. Mike Rose and Cpl. Wayne Couter from CED western region were contacted and advised of the situation. Both Sgt. Rose and Cpl. Couter responded to the barrack and conducted an interview with the anonymous caller.    I request this case to remain open pending further investigation.    All events occurred in Garrett County Maryland.      </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 2/20/2023, myself along with Cpl. Couter, responded to the McHenry Barrack and interviewed an individual in regard to information of stolen items from the Salem School The confidential complainant was cooperative during our interview and provided pertinent information that was valuable to the investigation. On 2/21/2023, he/she contacted this investigator and wanted to recant any information that he/she provided the night before, as it would create many issues if the information provided got out. The complainant was not willing to cooperate anymore. Due to the uncooperative nature of the original complainant, the investigation continued by conducting interviews with persons of interest and potential witnesses.  Justin Lam On 2/21/2023, I responded to the Salem School, 2704 Lower New Germany Road, Grantsville MD 21536. I met with the finance director, Justin Lam. Lam is still attempting to locate receipts to prove value and ownership by Salem School for the stolen items. I wanted to clear up some questions I had on what items were taken, what items were returned, and what items are still missing. Lam said that the mower, a red Mitsubishi generator, and a saw had been returned. He stated that three generators, a chainsaw, a miter saw, a propane ceiling fan, and a portable battery charger are still unaccounted for. Lam said that one saw was returned over the weekend, but is now missing again. No serial numbers have been located for the missing items. Lam stated that he has not checked the garage or storage areas as of today, to see if any of the other items may have shown up. I asked Lam if he had a timeline for the stolen items. He stated that the items were most likely taken during the period from end of December 2022 to mid-February. My intentions were to meet with Lam and then contact suspect Green while at work for an interview. I was informed that Green is only part-time and left work around noon. He stated that he is a twenty hour a week employee and only works half days. Lam also told me that he has always gotten along with Green. He most likely would be happy if the items were returned and may not pursue criminal charges, but he would need to check with Matt Eichhorn to confirm.  On 2/21/2023, I also had M/T Romanchak perform a Rapid search, both generic and advanced, for the stolen items in this case. No matches were found being pawned in the last sixty days. Suspect Greens name was not associated with any pawns in the RAPID System. A Criminal History was produced on suspect Green. Green has not criminal history.   On 2/22/2023 I responded back to the Salem school to interview suspect Green. Lam informed me that he received a text from Green this morning. Green told him that he would be in late today, around 11:30-12:00. Lam has not terminated Green as of this date, as he is waiting to see what happens with our investigation before he is terminated.  James Franklin Green(DOB 5/11/1979) On 2/22/2023, I interviewed suspect Green at the Salem School. The interview was conducted in the school library, and was recorded. The following is not a word for word account of the interview. A copy of the complete interview will be held on disk in the case file, stored at the McHenry Barrack. Green was mirandized via a MSP Form 180, and agreed to speak with me. Green was informed that the interview would be recorded. Green did not contest the interview being recorded. I informed Green who l was, and explained my reason for contacting him. I informed him that items have been taken from the Salem School, and I have information to believe that he is in possession of some items. I went through a list of items that were missing. Green confessed to removing some items from the Salem School grounds. Green stated that he was informed by an employee, who he would not name, that the items were not on any inventory, and he(Green) made a bad decision and took the items off campus grounds. Green admitted to the wrong doing and returned the items that he took.  I then re-contacted the finance director, Lam. Lam stated that he did not want to pursue charges against green since the items were to be returned. Lam set up a conference call with Salem board member, Pastor Matthew Eichhorn. Eichhorn spoke on behalf of the board of directors, and reiterated that they did not want to pursue any charges against suspect Green.  It should be noted that a 10,000 watt Generac generator had been reported as missing. Suspect Green was questioned about that specific item. Green told me during interview that he did not take the Generac generator. He stated that he noticed it was missing, but a lot of items were missing, so he didnt think anything of it. I informed Lam that I did not think Green was responsible for the missing Generac generator and Lam tended to agree with me, due to the fact that Green had been up front about all the items that he removed from the facility.  I contacted Garrett County States Attorney Mash and informed him of the case update. The States Attorney will not be seeking prosecution in this case.  Case closed as the victim does not wish to pursue charges in this case.  </NarrativeText>
