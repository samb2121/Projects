         <NarrativeText>VIDEO/AUDIO RECORDINGS: Car B-35 // Body worn Camera available // In Car Camera available // Car B-9 // S/Tpr Hopkins #6060 // Body worn Camera available // In Car Camera available //   ATTACHMENTS:  Seven (7) digital photographs of the scene. Two (2) MSP Form 76, Written Statement.  WITNESS/NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK: I observed surveillance cameras on top of 150 Walkers Village Way, Walkersville, MD 21793. The owner of the Valley Cleaners advised they did not have access to the cameras. The manager provided the phone number for the management company of the complex. I contacted Donna (410-861-8320) who advised she did not have access to the cameras. Donna advised she would attempt to find access to the cameras. I provided Donna my contact information and advised her to contact me if she finds access to the cameras. TFC Devin #7046 observed a doorbell camera at 11 Chapel Court. TFC Devin made contact with the homeowner and reviewed camera footage. This check revealed negative results. TFC Devin responded to the Rutters gas station and checked surveillance footage. This check revealed negative results. TFC Devin responded to the Walkersville Public Library and did not located anyone matching the description of the suspect.  SUSPECT: Unknown black male approximately 61 wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, brown face mask, brown gloves, large buggy eyes, black shoes, and possibly black hair.  NARRATIVE:  On 3/31/2023 at 0806 hours, I was dispatched to Safeway, 151 Walkers Village Way, Walkersville, MD 21793, for a reported armed robbery. Prior to Troopers arrival, the suspect fled the scene on foot. Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant, Elizabeth M Bowen Droneburg (W/F DOB: 6/26/1959), who was identified by her Maryland Drivers License. Droneburg advised she came into work at 0700 hours to work her normal shift at Safeway. Droneburg was working register #2 as a cashier. Droneburg observed an unknown black male walk into the Safeway at 0758 hours. Droneburg described him as approximately 61 wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, brown facemask, brown gloves, large buggy eyes, black shoes, and possibly black hair. Droneburg advised the male looked like a robber when he walked in. The unknown male retrieved a cart and started to walk towards the register. At 0759 hours, the male walked behind Droneburgs register and retrieved two Kit Kat bars. The male left the cart behind the register, and walked to the register line. The male placed two Kit Kat bars onto the grocery belt and waited for the subject ahead of him in line to finish checking out. The male walked past the cash register and stood between the cashier and the grocery bags. Droneburg advised me that the male placed his right hand into his pocket and he advised her that he had had a knife. The male advised Droneburg, This is a robbery. Droneburg replied to the male, What? The male advised her, Yes Im robbing you, open the drawer. The male continued, If you scream or call anyone, Ill stab the shit out of you. Droneburg retrieved $410.00 US currency of unknown denominations from the cash register and handed it to the male. The male advised, Dont scream or call anyone until I am out of the store. The male then walked out of the store, southeast towards Chapel Court. The male did not steal the candy bars. Droneburg called her manager, John Robert Moberly (W/M DOB: 12/3/1965), and notified him of the incident. Moberly responded to the front of the store where Droneburg was. Droneburg advised she was afraid for her life, and believed the male would have stabbed her if she had not retrieved the money. Droneburg advised that the male was very calm during the incident. Droneburg advised she did not think it was his first time committing an armed robbery.  Troopers, and Deputies from the Frederick County Sheriffs Office, attempted to locate the subject which revealed negative results. I next completed a neighborhood check, see statement above. S/Tpr Burleson #5743, Criminal Enforcement Division, responded to the scene and attempted to gather surveillance footage from Safeway. The manager was unable to copy the footage. S/Tpr Burleson will follow up with the manager to retrieve the footage. All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland. CASE STATUS: I request this case be forwarded to the Criminal Enforcement Division West for further investigation. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Attachments:   Copy of MSP Form 67 - Chain of Custody Log   DVD containing video surveillance from Safeway  Narrative:    On 03/31/2023, at approximately 0815 hours, I was advised by D/Sgt. Martin of a possible armed robbery that had just occurred at the Safeway located in Walkersville, MD. D/Sgt. Martin requested that I respond to the location and assist Troopers on scene. Upon arriving on scene, I contacted Tfc. Koontz who was the initial responding Trooper. Tfc. Koontz advised the suspect fled in an unknown direction and MSP K9 was called but due to the location being a shopping mall with heavy foot traffic it was determined that it was not beneficial. Tfc. Koontz had already interviewed the cashier and obtained a written statement from her, portions of his report are captioned below.    On 3/31/2023 at 0806 hours, I was dispatched to Safeway, 151 Walkers Village Way, Walkersville, MD 21793, for a reported armed robbery. Prior to Troopers arrival, the suspect fled the scene on foot.    Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant, Elizabeth M Bowen Droneburg (W/F DOB: 6/26/1959), who was identified by her Maryland Drivers License. Droneburg advised she came into work at 0700 hours to work her normal shift at Safeway. Droneburg was working register #2 as a cashier. Droneburg observed an unknown black male walk into the Safeway at 0758 hours. Droneburg described him as approximately 61 wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, brown facemask, brown gloves, large buggy eyes, black shoes, and possibly black hair. Droneburg advised the male looked like a robber when he walked in.    The unknown male retrieved a cart and started to walk towards the register. At 0759 hours, the male walked behind Droneburgs register and retrieved two Kit Kat bars. The male left the cart behind the register, and walked to the register line. The male placed two Kit Kat bars onto the grocery belt and waited for the subject ahead of him in line to finish checking out. The male walked past the cash register and stood between the cashier and the grocery bags. Droneburg advised the male placed his right hand into his pocket and advised he had a knife. The male advised Droneburg, This is a robbery. Droneburg advised, What? The male advised, Yes Im robbing you, open the drawer. The male continued, If you scream or call anyone, Ill stab the shit out of you. Droneburg retrieved $410.00 of unknown denominations from the cash register and handed it to the male. The male advised, Dont scream or call anyone until I am out of the store. The male then walked out of the store southeast towards Chapel Court. The male did not steal the candy bars. Droneburg called her manager, John Robert Moberly (W/M DOB: 12/3/1965), and notified him of the incident. Moberly responded to the front of the store where Droneburg was. Droneburg advised she was afraid for her life, and believed the male would have stabbed her if she had not retrieved the money. Droneburg advised the male was very calm during the incident. Droneburg advised she did not think it was his first time committing an armed robbery.     Troopers and Deputies from the Frederick County Sheriffs Office attempted to locate the subject which revealed negative results.  Tfc. Koontz requested that this report be forwarded to CED West for follow up.    On 04/04/2023, I received a phone call from Cpl. Shultz with the Frederick City Police Department. He advised Richard Allen Johnson Jr (B/M, D.O.B. 07/14/1962) was in custody at their department and he admitted to the armed robbery at the Safeway. Cpl. Schultz explained that on 0401/2023, they had an armed robbery committed at the Giant Eagle Supermarket located at 1305 W. 7th Street Frederick MD 21702. After seeing a social media post about the robbery, Johnson came in and spoke to investigators. Johnson was interviewed by Detective Radtke with Frederick City Police Department and admitted to both the robbery at the Safeway and the Giant Eagle. In reference to the Safeway, Johnson stated that he did not have a knife at the time and believed he got less than $500. Johnson was shown still images from video surveillance of the armed robbery and identified himself in the images as being the one committing the robbery. Johnson said after getting the money he used it to but drugs. Once the drugs were used up, he committed the robbery at the Giant in order to buy more drugs. After speaking to Cpl. Shultz, I applied for and received a warrant for the following charges for Johnson.   Robbery  Assault Second Degree  Theft $100 to under $1,500   I have requested a copy of the police report and interview from the Frederick City Police Department. Once I receive them, they will be added as attachments to the case file. On 04/04/2023, Cpl. Mills obtained a copy of the video surveillance from Safeway and stored it at the Frederick Barrack per Maryland State Police policies and procedures.  All the above events occurred in Frederick County MD.  I request this case be closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
