         <NarrativeText>Case # 23-MSP-032898 Date: 09-19-2023 Time:1015 hours Location: 10434 Assateague Road, Berlin, MD 21811 This interaction was captured through my body warn camera (BWC). Photographs: Twenty-eight (28) attached to report.  Charges: -1 1137_AOL - CR 7 104 : THEFT: $100 TO UNDER $1,500.          - CO193 - 11.05.05.06(a)(1) : MDOP Malicious Destruction of Property climb, deface, destroy, disturb, harm, injure, remove, tamper with.   On September 19, 2023, at approximately 1051 hours, I was dispatched to respond to 10434 Assateague Road for a theft that had already occurred. When I arrived, Tpr. Jenkins was already on scene speaking with the complainant identified through his MD ID asDavid Lee Joyner DOB: (12/11/1963 B/M). As I approached them, Joyner seemed to had been very upset about the theft that had already occurred. He stated that everyday he cuts wood. He stated that it is hard work that he had put into cutting the wood and selling it for someone to just come and take his money. He stated that he has four (4) kids to take care of. Joyner informed us that someone had taken his money previously. He stated that he was giving who ever the individual was a break, but can not keep having this happen to him. He stated that he had not pressed charges against this unknown individual before, but now something has to be done. He stated that for the past three (3) months an unknown suspect had stolen money from five (5) times. He stated that the suspect came in about 0600 hours or 0730 hours to scope things out wearing all black. I asked Joyner if he could give me the run down on what had happened. As we walked to the side of the house where the stacks of wood were, I observed a white tool box on the ground with the words look down spray-painted on it. In the front of the tool box was a slot that he had cut to make it easy for people to drop money into as payment for the stacks of wood they purchase. He stated that the box is always secured with a pad lock. He stated that he makes is money this way through a trust program. Most of the time, the buyers are regular customers and are familiar with how the money drops. I then observed a broken lock on the ground in front of the tool box. The toolbox had also had damage done to it from where someone had broken into it. Joyner was not sure if the suspect that had done this was the homeless guy identified as Derrick Eugene Smith (DOB:12/25/1966 B/W). Joyner stated that at approximately 0730 hours on September 18, 2023, he came to the address and only notified two stacks of wood missing. He stated that he had arrived to the scene at approximately 0940 hours on September 19, 2023, and was met by a customer who informed him that she had placed a plastic bag into the toolbox with twenty dollars in it. He stated that at that time he opened the toolbox after noticing the padlock broken and on the ground. He observed the bag to be in the toolbox along with the money that the customer had informed him that she had left. He then stated that he counted the stacks of wood that was missing, after noticing that his money was missing from the toolbox. While he was on the phone with the police, he stated that he was missing nearly $1,000 from the toolbox, and the stacks of wood. He stated that his neighbor identified as Stacy Lynn White (DOB: 02/18/1971 W/F) told him that she observed Smith in the area on his bicycle riding around in the early morning. Worcester County Sheriffs Office informed the Berlin Barrack that Smith was trespassed from the above address previously for theft.   Joyner informed me that he had two (2) cameras which are activated when there is motion. He then took the SD card out of both cameras, and allowed us to view what was on them. The camera that was hidden in the tree above the tool box captured a light colored Mercury which was occupied by three (3) individuals. At approximately 0223 hours, the vehicle is seen on the premises. A white female with glasses is seen driving the vehicle. At that time a male subject exits from the rear driver-side door. The male subject had a black in color face cover on, wearing a white shirt, light colored athletics shorts, and a pair of multicolored Nike basketball shoes. He then approaches the toolbox and is there for approximately two minutes, then is seen returning to the vehicle. As the subject walks back to the vehicle he is seen to be carrying what looked to be a black bolt cutter in his right hand with gloves covering both hands. While he walked toward the vehicle, a third passenger is seen sitting in the front passenger seat. The passenger looked to be a white unidentified female with dark-colored hair. At approximately 0225 hours the vehicle is seen leaving the area and then coming back facing the opposite direction of when it first arrived. The vehicle front riverside tire looked to be a spare while the other three where normal with the chrome rim. There looked to be some sort of wire hanging from the passenger rear where the antenna was. At approximately 0226 hours the same male subject is seen walking behind the vehicle towards the toolbox. At 0227 hours the male subject walks toward the vehicle carrying unidentified items in his hands. At approximately 0241 the same vehicle is seen back on scene. At that time the male subject gets out of the vehicle again and walked toward the toolbox, and then back to the vehicle. The vehicle left and did not return. After carefully observing the camera footage, I was not able to see Smith on scene at all. Joyner described Smith to be very slim, and was not the male subject that was in the footage. A neighborhood check was attempted with no success.      I asked Joyner if he knew of anyone that would do this, and he informed me that besides Smith, no other person came to his mind. He did not recognize the three (3) suspects that were involved in the theft.Twenty-eight photographs are attached to this report. Joyner did complete a witness statement and was provided the case number, along with the Victim and Witness pamphlet.  I asked that this case remain open to gather further information.  All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

Heather Renee Scott DOB: 07/02/1978 W/F       On 10/13/2023 at approximately 1221 hours, I, Trooper Gibbons # 7441 received a phone call from Heather Renee Scott (DOB 07/02/1978 W/F). While speaking with her on the phone, she stated that she was already aware of the incident that had happened on 09/19/2023. At approximately 1225 hours Heather waived her rights to counsel. She stated that while she was at her home on 09/19/2023, she received a phone call from a close friend she knew as Deshawn and his girlfriend. Heather then stated that Deshawn worked or claimed to still work for Joyner. She stated that she has a problem with substance abuse, and so does Deshawn, and his girlfriend who Heather stated goes by Emily Rose. She does not know their address nor their date of birth. Heather then stated that Deshawn informed her that he needed to go to the wood box to get money out so that he could get something. She stated that he had her drive him get money from the wood box that was located at 10434 Assateague Road Berlin, MD 21811. She stated that she was not aware of what was going on nor what Deshawns intent was. She stated that while Deshawn was outside the car, he was doing something that she did not know of nor could she see. She stated that when she had pulled her vehicle up, she heard a loud bang.She stated that she believed he had tied something to the wood box, and the back of the vehicle. She stated that she had asked Deshawn what he was doing, and informed him that this was not cool. Heather then stated that Deshawn then started telling her to go (three 3xs), repeating himself after getting back into her vehicle. Heather stated that she took Deshawn to his mothers house. The wood box was in the garage of his mothers house. I asked her if she knew what the address to Deshawns mother was, she stated that she did not. She stated that Deshawn had informed her that he had the key to the wood and that he was just going to get some money out of it. She informed me that she would cooperate and help me with anything that I needed. I informed her that a crime had been committed, and the owner stated that over $1000 had been taken from the box. She then stated that she know that the box did not have that much money in it because Deshawn showed her how much money he had taken. She stated that he took about $60 from the box. I asked her if she remembered what Deshawn was wearing that day, and she stated that she did not. She stated that she would be willing to come into the Barrack and speak more on other things that she knows that Deshawn has done that is illegal, and would be willing to provide more on other things as well. She stated that she does not want to go to jail and is willing to help in any way to stay out of jail. She provided me with her contact information, and I provided her the number to the Barrack to set up the time to come in person.  I request this case remain open to follow up on additional leads.

         <NarrativeText>This incident was audible, and visually recorded through my body warn camera (BWC).  Narrative:    On November 07, 2023, at approximately 1320 hours TFC S. Shubert # 6944, and I, Trooper Gibbons # 7441 made contact with Heather Renee Scott at her place of residence 10004 Orchard Road, Berlin Maryland 21811. While speaking with Scott her statement in reference to the theft of the money was the same as our conversation through the telephone. She continued to state that she was not aware of Spences intentions of stealing the money from the wood box located at 10434 Assateague Road Berlin, MD 21811. She stated that she was asked by Spence to pick him up from his mother Beatrice Spence home at 101 Ennis Lane Berlin, MD 21811, and take him to the location to get money from the wood box. Scott stated that Spence took the money box from the wood box with him. She stated that she drove Spence back to his mothers residence. Scott then stated that while at the residence, Spence broke into the money box using a metal bolt cutter. She then stated that on that Spence showed her the money that he had retrieved from the box which totaled the amount of $60. She stated that there was not $1000, or even over that amount in the wood box. She stated that she was certain that the amount that Spence showed her was the only money from the box. Scott positively identified Spence as the one that stole the money from the wood box. She verified his identity with me through Spences Facebook profile, and the MVA photograph.  On November 09, 2023, an application for charges was completed, and submitted through the Ocean City District Commissioners Office.  I request this case remain open pending Commissioners review.  All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
