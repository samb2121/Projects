         <NarrativeText>On April 28th, 2023 at approximately 1312 hours I was dispatched to 32791 Bluff Point Drive, Cordova, Talbot County, Maryland, for a report of an identify theft and fraud. Upon my arrival, I contacted Marie Denise Ann Mitchell (06/22/1980 2F) who stated her she believed her work email was hacked. Mitchell advised her company, Velocity HVAC, was scheduled to do work for a customer named Robert Burns Irvine 3rd (08/11/1965 2/M) on May 1st, 2023. Mitchell advised Irvine was sent an invoice using the Velocity HVAC software, which sent the invoice through email, but the recipient was unable to reply back to the email. Mitchell had a copy of the invoice email that was sent and provided a copy to me. The copy of the invoice provided showed an email address of  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;notifications@housecallpro.com Underneath the email it showed a reply to address of  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com. The invoice was numbered 675430-2, dated April 11th, 2023 and the service listed was a fifty percent deposit for a total of $16,925. Mitchell then provided me emails she received from Irvine dated April 28th, 2023 at 1153 hours which stated  Here it is, Denise. The email was sent to  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;velocityhvac2@gmail.com, which Mitchell advised was her personal account. Mitchell further pointed out all the email conversation between Irvine and an email address that matched her work email of  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com, but the emails in the chain were not in her email. I observed the email Irvine was using in the email chain was  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com. Mitchell stated she believed someone had hacked into her email account and somehow stopped the emails from Irvine from appearing in her inbox, yet she was still receiving emails from other customers. The email chain Mitchell provided to me stated the following:  On April 12th, 2023 at 1642 hours, Irvine utilized the email address  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com to send an email to denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com. The subject line stated RE: Invoice 675430-2 due from Velocity HVAC - $16925.00. Irvine stated in the email Denise, I paid this via my Bank of America bill pay. You should have a check in hand by 4/19. Thanks! Rob.  The next email listed was dated April 14th, 2023 at 1318 hours from denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com and stated the following:  Hi Rob,  Sorry for the late response, I have been out of the office since Tuesday evening. We were wondering if you can process this payment as Ach/EFT instead of check? We are having a hard time receiving mails these days due to counterfeit check from one of our vendors and mail check getting lost. Can you please put a stop on the check Or we can destroy the check if we receive it in the future .Kindly advise if there is a form to b filled out to get this Ach/EFT done today .we will be sending you our new banking information upon your  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Thank you  Denise.  Sent from Mail for Windows  The next email in the chain was from Irvine with the  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com account and dated April 14th, 2023 1415 hours. The email was sent to denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com with the same subject as earlier. The email stated Ill call my bank to see if thats possible. Ill get back to you this afternoon.  The next email within the chain was from denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com and dated April 14th, 2023 at 1422 hours. The email was sent to Irvine at  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com and stated the following:  Rob,        Find our bank information for you to make ACH payments. Please let me know if you have any questions.         USA BANK NA        Routing number :122105155        Account number 151708774121  Thank you  Denise.  Sent from Mail for Windows   After reading all the emails provided, I noticed the following issues within the emails:   In the email dated April 14th, 2023 at 1318 hours, I observed the ch in Ach was lowercased twice while in a second email dated April 14th, 2023 at 1422 hours the ch in Ach was capitalized (ACH)  In the email dated April 14th, 2023 at 1318 hours, I observed the sentence We are having a hard time receiving mails these days due to a counterfeit check from one of our vendors and mail check getting lost. In this sentence the receiving mails and mail check getting lost are not grammatically correct.  In the email dated April 14th, 2023 at 1318 hours, in the sentence Can you please put a stop on the check Or we can destroy the check if we receive it in the future .. This sentence has a capitalized O in or in the middle of the sentence and the period at the end of the sentence is spaced away instead of right after the last word.   In the email dated April 14th, 2023 at 1318 hours, in the sentence .we will be sending you our new banking information upon your, I noticed the period was again spaced away from the last word and right next to the w. I also observed the w for the beginning of a new sentence was not capitalized and at the end of the sentence, the sentence is not complete    margin-left:8px"&gt;In the email dated April 14th, 2023 at 1422 hours, I observed the : after routing number was again spaced away from the r in number and in the accounting number there was not a : utilized.  Based off these observations, I believe the email chain between Irvine and denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com is not between Irvine and Mitchell from Velocity HVAC, but rather Irvine and an unknown offender spoofing the email of Mitchell to communicate with Irvine. Mitchell stated she had been in communication with Irvine earlier in the day and that US Bank needed a case number from law enforcement, and to speak to law enforcement, in order to freeze the account to potentially recover and money within the account. I contacted the US Bank Fraud division and provided the account number of 151708774121 and was advised the account was for a checking account. I was also advised the account possibly belonged to a Paul Fisher. I was then transferred between two different fraud departments and the intelligence department, multiple times, before being advised no one would be able to assist me as they were not allowed to speak to law enforcement and I would need to contact the Legal department. I also utilized wise.com/us/routing-number/us-bank to run the routing number that was provided. The routing number of 122105155 was listed to the US Bank in Arizona. Mitchell did state that Velocity HVAC does not accept wire transfers, and there is a 1% service charge on the transfers. I asked Mitchell if I could look at her email account, which she agreed. I searched Robb in the search bar and located emails stating it was from Rob Irvine. In the email, there was two total emails in the chain. The first email was as follows:   From: Rob Irvine  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbrivine@gmail.com  Sent: Monday, April 24, 2023 6:06 PM  To: denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com  Subject: Pay of 1 of 2 has been transferred   Hi Denise,  I was successfully able to wire you $16,025 this afternoon from my bank. It turns out the issue I had earlier was due to the browser I was using. Evidently, Bank of Americas development team didnt test their software on Firefox! You will have the money by tomorrow.  Can you send me an invoice for the balance? Our title company will issue you a check since theyre holding aside some of our settlement fees for repairs. Id like to make sure you get that before the work is complete.  Thanks, Kate!  Rob  The second email in the chain was as follows:   From: Rob Irvine  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbrivine@gmail.com   Sent: Monday, April 26, 2023 6:06 PM  To: denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com  Subject: Pay of 1 of 2 has been transferred   Hi Denise,  I just got word from my bank this morning that the wire transfer was refunded back to my account.The reason the funds were refunded was because I was transitioning from my personal bank to another.I just issued a check. You should have it in hand by 4/28.  Can you send me an invoice for the balance?  Thanks, Kate!  Rob  After reading the two emails, Mitchell advised she had not seen the emails before. I started looking at the two emails and ultimately started seeing similar grammar and punctuation mistakes in the second email, dated April 26th, 2023 0953 hours, compared to the first email. I was ultimately able to confirm later that the first email, dated April 24th, 2023 at 1806 hours was written by Irvine, which will be detailed below. I also noticed the email addresses used to email Mitchell was different from the original email address. The email address used to send these emails was robbrivine@gmail.com compared to robbirvine@gmail.com. I noticed within the last name of Irvine the I and the R were switched. In the second email I also noticed the email was finished with the same ending of Thanks, Kate! Rob. I also observed there was not a space after the periods for two sentences. The sentences were account.The and another.I. I also noticed there was a double space between personal and bank (personal bank). This again led me to believe that an unknown offender created a fake email account for Irvine and utilized the email account to email Velocity HVAC making it seem he attempted to pay them the $16,925 but was having issues.  After leaving from Mitchells residence, I contacted Irvine on the phone. Irvine stated his correct email address was  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com. Irvine stated he had multiple email conversations with who he thought was Mitchell from Velocity HVAC. Irvine also stated that he had received phone calls from a Centreville, Maryland phone number and during one of the phone conversations Irvine recalled being asked about potentially paying through a wire transfer. I asked Irvine about the emails and if he noticed anything that seemed off and Irvine stated no. Irvine did mention that in one email, dated April 24th, 2023 at 1806 hours, he had typed the amount paid as $16,025 when the amount was actually $16,925. Irvine also stated he had typed the name Kate at the end, compared to typing Denise. I asked Irvine if he would be able to send me a copy of all his email correspondences with Velocity HVAC, which Irvine stated he would compile all the emails and provide me copies. I then asked Irvine about the phone calls he had received and Irvine stated that on April 23rd, 2023, he had received a total of one phone calls, some of which were missed phone calls, from 410-490-1454, which I knew to be Mitchells phone number. Irvine also stated that on April 21, 2023, he received one phone call from the same phone number. Irvine stated he believed he had received phone calls from 410-490-1312, which I know is the phone number listed on the website for Velocity HVAC, as well but could not remember the date or see the calls in his call history log on his phone. Irvine stated he could not remember which number called him when he was discussing the possibility of paying from a wire transfer. I asked Irvine if he was certain the caller was Mitchell when they discussed the payment through wire transfer and Irvine stated he thought it was but could not be certain. Irvine did advise he would obtain a copy of his phone records from his phone service company and provide a copy to me with to confirm which phone number called him after April 11th, which was the day the invoice was originally sent.   On April 29th, 2023, Mitchell contacted the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack and advised she saw an email, which had been sent on April 28th, 2023, which was from Rob Irvine, however the address was  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbrivine@gmail.com. Mitchell asked if she should reply back to the email and I advised Mitchell not to reply at this time. Mitchell did forward the email to me, which stated the following:   From: Rob Irvine  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbrivine@gmail.com  Sent: Friday, April 28, 2023 8:23:58 PM To: denise velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com; phillip velocityhvac.com  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;phillip@velocityhvac.com Subject: Invoice 675430-2 due from Velocity HVAC - $16925.00  The wire transfer was refunded back to my accountAs discussed, I understand,I already issued a check on Tuesday. You should have it in hand by Monday.Also I have to pay you the remaining balance before you complete the work on Monday. For my paperwork, can you send me a new invoice for the last $16,925? Once I receive that, Ill mail out the balance check.  I immediately noticed that in the email, the sender stated he issued a check on Tuesday, however in the email dated April 26th, 2023, 0953 hours, which was provided from Mitchell, the sender had stated the check was issued on Wednesday. The sender also stated that the check would be in hand by Monday, however in the email dated April 26th, 2023 at 0953 hours, the sender is originally stated the check would be in hand on 4/28. I also noticed this email again had similar grammar and punctuation errors as previously mentioned emails. In this particular email, I noticed the following errors:    There was no space between the words account and as, and the word as had a capital A in the middle of the sentence.   There was no space after the comma between understand and I as well as no space after the period between Monday and Also.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;The statement Ill mail out the balance check does not seem appropriate, compared to Ill mail out a check for the balance.   On April 29th, 2023, I received and reviewed multiple emails from Irvine, between himself and Velocity HVAC. The emails to and from Irvine utilized the  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com address, which again was confirmed to be Irvines correct email address. The first email was dated April 10th, 2023 at 2101 hours, which listed a new proposal from Velocity HVAC. The proposal was sent from  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;notifications@housecallpro.com and listed a reply-to address of Velocity HVAC  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com. The proposal email did include a financing link and information related to the application for the financing. The second email was sent from  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com to Weez  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;louisastovall00@aol.com. This email contained the proposal sent from Velocity HVAC on April 10th, 2023 at 2101 hours. The third email provided was dated April 11th, 2023 @ 1133 hours and was sent from  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;notifications@housecallpro.com. The reply-to email address this time was just listed as  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com. The fourth email provided was dated April 12th, 2023 at 1530 hours. The email was from  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;notifications@housecallpro.com and again had a reply-to address of  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com. The email stated a job was scheduled with Velocity HVAC. The job was scheduled for Monday May 1st, 2023. All previous emails were sent to  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;robbirvine@gmail.com.

The sixth email that Irvine had provided was sent from Irvine to  text-decoration: underline;"&gt;denise@velocityhvac.com. The email was dated April 12th, 2023 at 1642 hours.

NOTE: In the above emails provided from Irvine, some emails were already discussed and therefore the indicators I have observed have also been documented.

         <NarrativeText>On May 2nd, 2023 at approximately 1255 hours, I made contact with Sue Thao, Assistant Vice President for U.S. Bank. Thao suggested Irvine contact Bank of America to see if a recall was attempted on the wire. Thao also asked if additional paperwork would be completed for the case. I asked Thao if a subpoena or a court order would be needed to obtain the bank records and to put a freeze on the account. Thaos advised a court order would be required to freeze the bank account.  I made contact with Irvine who stated he was currently completing a form for Bank of America that would allow them to call U.S. Bank on his behalf. I requested Irvine contact me with an update after the paperwork was submitted. Irvine provided a copy of the Scam Victim Acknowledgement form he signed. The BASS Claim number from Bank of America is 28APR2023-859237. A copy of the form was uploaded to the attachment section.    I request this case remain open pending further investigation.</NarrativeText>
