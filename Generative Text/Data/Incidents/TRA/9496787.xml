         <NarrativeText>Case # 23-MSP-004748 Defendant: Christopher White III Date of Birth: 02/25/1994 Date of Arrest: 02/07/2023 Time of Arrest: 0019 Hours DUI #: 23-034  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING:  *I am trained to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training. *I am trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion  On February 7, 2023, at approximately 0000 hours, I, TFC Barnes (#7269), currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack, on duty, operating unmarked Maryland State Police patrol vehicle, N-7, in the area of MD 355 and Tuckerman Lane. I observed a white BMW X4 that appeared to be driving at a high rate of speed pass my patrol vehicle in the right lane. The vehicle continued south on MD 355 and a vehicle exiting from a parking lot attempted to merge on southbound MD 355. The white BMW X4 which was traveling a high rate of speed had to swerve to avoid a collision with the vehicle. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the white X4. I further identified the white BMW X4 to be bearing Maryland registration T1182037.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact  I made contact with the driver of the white X4. I asked the driver for his license and registration. I immediately observed the male driver to be disoriented and looked disheveled. The driver had a blank stare and had make multiple attempts to grab the registration card from the female passenger. I identified the male operator as Christopher White III (B/M, DOB: 02/25/1994). I asked Christopher III where he was coming from that night and he stated the movies. I asked Christopher III how much alcohol he had to drink that night and he stated, One shot. While speaking with Christopher III, I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Christopher III speech was slurred. I requested Christopher III to consent to voluntary standardized field sobriety tests, which he agreed to take. While Christopher III was exiting the vehicle he stumbled.   Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening  The tests were conducted in a left turn lane on MD 355 in the area of Tuckerman Lane. The surface was level and free from obvious debris. Christopher III displayed no visible injuries. The front facing emergency lights of my patrol vehicle were deactivated during all phases of testing.  I asked Christopher III the following questions:  Daily/Regular Medications  N/A. Glasses N/A. Contacts  N/A. Injuries  N/A  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST (6/6 clues displayed)  I used my finger as a stimulus and held it approximately 12 to 15 inches from Christopher IIIs eyes. His eyes displayed no resting nystagmus and his pupils were equal in size. His eyes also showed equal tracking. Christopher III was advised to stand with his feet together and his hands down at his sides during the instruction/demonstration and throughout the test. I asked Christopher III if he could see the tip of my stimulus and he stated that he could. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Christopher III was instructed to follow the stimulus with his eyes only, keeping his head still. After stating that he understood the instructions, Christopher III attempted the test with the following results: 1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes. 2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 degrees - Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues displayed)  Prior to Christopher III performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test is conducted. Christopher III was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel-to-toe. Christopher III was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Christopher III was instructed to take a series of nine (9) heel-to-toe steps in a straight line. Christopher III was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count every step aloud. On the ninth step, it was explained and demonstrated, to keep his lead foot on the line, to take a series of small steps around, and to completely turn around 180 degrees. It was explained and demonstrated to Christopher III that the second series of nine (9) heel-to-toe steps were to be performed identically to the first series. I instructed Christopher III, that once the test begins to continue until instructed to stop. I reminded Christopher III to place his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. I asked Christopher III if he understood the test, and he confirmed that he understood. Instructional Stage -Did not keep balance during instructions. Walking Stage (1st Nine Steps) -Missed heel-to-toe contact on steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. -Stepped offline on steps 3, 8 and 9. -Stopped walking and hesitated on step 9 before attempting the turn. The Turn -Nothing to report.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine Steps) -Missed heal-to-toe on steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. -Stepped offline on steps 3 and 6.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues displayed)  Christopher III was instructed to stand with his feet together and his hands flat to his sides while the test instructions and demonstration were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground in front of him approximately 6 inches, keeping him legs straight and his toes pointed out in front of him parallel to the ground. While his leg was raised, he was to count out loud by thousands (one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three...) and to continue counting until told to stop. After demonstrating the test, Christopher III advised he understood, raising his left foot off the ground.  Instructional Stage -Nothing to report. Balancing and Counting Stage 0-10 Seconds: -Nothing to report. 10-20 Seconds: -Placed foot down. -Used arms for balance. 20-30 Seconds: -Swayed while balancing. -Placed foot down. I asked Christopher III if he would submit to a Preliminary Breath Test roadside, which he agreed to take, with the results being .12. Christopher III was placed under arrest for DUI/DWI at approximately 0019 hours. I placed Christopher III in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Christopher III was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: -Driving above the maximum posted speed limit. -Glassy, bloodshot eyes. -Slurred speech. -Stumbled while walking. -Moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. -Admitted to consuming an alcoholic beverage. -HGN: 6/6 clues displayed. -Walk and Turn: 4/8 clues. -One Leg Stand: 3/4 clues.  20 Minute Observation Period  Christopher III was transported to Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack N for further processing. Christopher III was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights and the audio was played out loud in English. The DR-15 audio can be found at mva.maryland.gov. Christopher III signed the DR-15 at approximately 0048 hours acknowledging his consent to take the test. Sgt. Tribue (5781), a certified Intoximeter Technician of the State of Maryland, conducted the test for Christopher III. Christopher IIIs breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Christopher III was issued six citations relating to DUI/DWI. Christopher III was then released at approximately 0230 hours to a sober and valid driver.  All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland.  I request this case to be closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
