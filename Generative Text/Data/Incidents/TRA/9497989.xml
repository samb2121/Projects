         <NarrativeText>Attachments Stored off-line due to filetype  Narrative On 1/22/2023 at approximately 2021 hours, Cpl. Wildman was contacted by Lt. Kail and assigned an investigation relating to a suicidal subject. Cpl. Wildman contacted the Headquarters Duty Officer and learned that multiple callers contacted MSP to report that an adult female identified as Yasmin Long had posted to Facebook indicating that she was actively ending her life and then posted a Facebook Live video showing her apparently overdosing in a vehicle.  Cpl. Wildman conducted phone interviews with a number of independent complainants and obtained copies of the post/live video. Cpl. Wildman learned that Long is a veteran and made one post in a shared veterans group. Cpl. Wildman learned that Long is assigned t-mobile phone number 951-528-7557 and uses Facebook profile source=gmailust=1675298178015000usg=AOvVaw3LgYk47quaFvMaXLD9Fynb" href="https://www.facebook.com/idgt.jersey.410" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/idgt.jersey.410. Cpl. Wildman submitted exigent requests to t-mobile and facebook for location data. Cpl. Wildman also contacted MCAC to obtain LPR reads on Longs vehicle. Cpl. Wildman contacted the Maryland Gun Center and learned that Long has no registered firearms.  At approximately 2056 hours, Cpl. Wildman began receiving t-mobile pings that generally geo-located to Catonsville, Baltimore County, MD. The ping radius (3000 meters) was too wide to identify a reasonable search area. The pings were consistent with Long being stationary. Additional timing advance historical records confirmed Longs general location and that she had been stationary for at least four hours. Cpl. Wildman contacted the Baltimore County Police Department and a BOLO was issued for Long and her vehicle. Cpl. Wildman also contacted TAU and requested assistance with additional tracking tools due to the wide pings.  At approximately 2136 hours, Cpl. Wildman observed a change in the t-mobile ping consistent with Long going mobile in a vehicle. Cpl. Wildman, after consultation with TAU, called Long via phone. After a discussion, Long acknowledged making the aforementioned Facebook posts and passing out in her vehicle. Cpl. Wildman asked Long to meet at the Baltimore Police Department Southwest District, and Long agreed. TAU was cancelled and Cpl. Wildman responded to the BPD SW District. The BPD SW district desk officer was apprised of the situation.  At approximately 2218 hours, Long arrived to the Baltimore Police SW district and met with Cpl. Wildman. Long acknowledged going through a breakup and admitted that she made multiple facebook posts. Long stated that she no longer felt suicidal.  At approximately 2259 hours, Trooper Thoren of the MSP Golden Ring Barrack arrived at the SW District and took Long into custody for an emergency petition. Trooper Thoren transported Long to St. Agnes Hospital, where she was transferred to hospital staff without incident.  Longs family members, the initial complainants, and MCAC were contacted an apprised of the case disposition. The Perry Point VA Police Department was also notified because Long resides on base.

Corporal Wildman advised me to respond to 424 Fonthill Avenue Baltimore City, Maryland, 21223 [Southwest District | Baltimore City Police Department] regarding a welfare check on a psychiatric female who stated she wanted to harm herself. Upon my arrival, I, Trooper Thoren 7131, made contact with Corporal Wildman, who was already in contact with this the female subject. The female subject was identified by her Maryland Drivers License as Yasmin Quadirah Long (DOB:04/23/1989 B/F), hereby referred to as Long. Long seemed distraught as well as passive-aggressive. Long stated she had thoughts about killing herself today. At approximately 2312 hours, I, Trooper Thoren 7131, took Long into custody to be brought over to Saint Agnes [900 S Caton Ave, Baltimore, MD 21229], for an Emergency Petition. Based on the above statements made from Long and screenshots of text messages and Facebook posts made by Long pertaining to her wanting to end her life. It should be noted that while at the Hospital Long was cooperative. While standing by at the Hospital, I, Trooper Thoren 7131, was able to make contact with Longs sister, Selena Wheatley DOB:07/16/1991, by telephone (410)499-4237 at approximately 0026 hours. Wheatly advised her sister needs the help, she also advised that long had been seriously depressed for some time and is really good at talking her way out of trouble. Wheatly expressed her extreme concern of her sisters, Long, mental stability. Additionally, Wheatly advised her sister told her she was going to kill herself and wheatly needed to bring the baby to the funeral at approximately 1021 hours on January 21, 2023. Once I arrived at Saint Agnes Hospital, I brought Long to the emergency room. I completed the required paperwork for an Emergency Petition. Custody of Long was transferred to Trooper Rhoten 7513, due to no available rooms at the time and the ending of my working shift.       I request this case be closed due to no further action taken by me.     All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland </NarrativeText>
