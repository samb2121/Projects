         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report  (For review by the MSPCrash Team)    SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION  On July 16, 2023, at approximately 1245 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack responded to northbound Rt. 1 (Bel Air Bypass) prior to Rock Spring Road, in Harford County, Maryland to investigate a motor vehicle collision involving a fatality. I was notified at 1258 hours and arrived on scene at 1331 to conduct a detailed crash investigation.  Upon the arrival of Troopers to the scene, a single vehicle collision involving a gray, 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier was discovered. Upon my arrival, TFC Skrodinsky #6757, Whittenberg #6095, Mott #6918, DeLaCruz #7273 were on scene to assist with the investigation. Personnel from the Bel Air Volunteer Company and Maryland Department of Transportation Maintenance Units were on scene to assist with injuries and lane closures. Each lane of northbound and southbound traffic was closed in this area of the Bel Air Bypass due to roadway evidence encompassing all travel lanes and the shoulder.  After conducting a preliminary investigation, it was determined that the collision involved a gray, 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier bearing Maryland registration 7CS8942. The Chevrolet was operated and owned by Janet Howell Sauer (2/F, DOB 7/13/1946). The Chevrolet was traveling northbound on the bypass in lane 1 approaching Rock Spring Road. At which time and for unknown reasons, Sauer lost control and struck the guardrail to the left of lane 1 which divided northbound and southbound traffic. The Chevrolet continued to travel across lane 1 of southbound traffic and overturned before coming to a final uncontrolled rest on the right shoulder of southbound traffic. Sauer became fully ejected and decapitated upon its final rest. Sauer was pronounced deceased on scene by Captain Richard Davis of the Bel Air Volunteer Fire Company at 1249 hours. Next of Kin was notified on scene as the children of Sauer arrived on scene during the investigation. The Chevrolet was stored at Banks Auto Recycler for further investigation. The scene was photographed, and measurements were obtained.  The investigation will address various elements which caused and/or contributed to the collision.     SECTION 2: SCENE DESCRIPTION  PRIMARY ROADWAY:  Maryland Route 1 is a State of Maryland Department of Transportation maintained roadway and constructed of asphalt. Maryland Route 1 is a divided roadway with northbound and southbound travel lanes. The northbound local lanes of Maryland Route 1 consist of two travel lanes, one lane for northbound Rt. 1, and a right exit lane for northbound Rt. 24. The right edge of the roadway of the northbound travel lanes are marked with a single, solid white line which is aligned with a guardrail. The left edge of the roadway is marked with a solid, yellow line aligned with a guardrail end. The southbound local lanes consist of one travel lane. The left edge of the roadway is marked with a single, solid yellow line and is aligned with the beginning of a guardrail. The right edge of the roadway is marked with a single, solid white line and a fully paved right shoulder along with a wide area grass embankment.  The collision occurred on a straight and level section of Maryland Route 1. Maryland Route 1 has a posted 50 mph speed limit in the collision. There were no sight limitations or view obstructions in the area which may have contributed. This section of Route 1 was free of debris. At the time of the collision, traffic was light, and the roadway was dry.  SECONDARY ROADWAY:  There is no secondary roadway involved.  TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICE:  There were painted roadway markings and a guardrail.  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS:  On July 16, 2023, at approximately 1245 hours, the weather consisted of cloudy skies with light intermittent rain and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The dew point was 73 degrees Fahrenheit with a relative humidity of 79 percent. (www.wunderground.com)     SECTION 3: SCENE EVIDENCE:   The Chevrolet was fully parked on the right shoulder embankment facing the opposite direction. There was extensive damage to the guardrail that was initially struck. There were multiple layers of guardrail peeled back and dislodged from the guardrail end. There were tire marks leading from lane 1 of northbound traffic into lane 1 of southbound traffic. I observed scrapes and gouge marks beginning in between the solid yellow lines separating the northbound from southbound lanes and into lane 1 of the southbound lanes. There were heavy scrape marks from the Chevrolet overturning and sliding on its roof in southbound lane 1 and the right shoulder along with a significant field of debris. The field of debris extended onto the right shoulder embankment area. A portion of guardrail plate that was dislodged from the guardrail end was located on the right shoulder of the southbound lane. Both passenger windows were completely shattered and broken out with blood splatter on the front passenger door along with damage to the rear passenger side panel. The front windshield was shattered throughout but still in place. The driver side sustained severe damage. Both drivers side tires were flattened and sustained bent rims. The drivers door was peeled open and to the rear in the Chevrolets interior. Both drivers side windows were destroyed. The drivers seat belt buckle was in the locked position, but no seat belt was attached. There was a significant amount of damage inside the Chevrolet with heavy blood spray. Sauers body was located on the ground in the up position outside the passenger door. Sauers head was in the back windowsill of the Chevrolet.

SECTION 6: FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION(S)  July 17, 2023  Sergeant Rumaker responded to Banks Towing located at 3610 Conowingo Road, Street, MD, 21154 and located and recovered the Chevrolets EDR module for future imaging. Sergeant Rumaker also checked the tires for size, tread depth and pressure. Digital photographs were also obtained of the interior and exterior of the Chevrolet. The speedometer was stuck at approximately 55 mph.   July 21, 2023  Sergeant Rumaker conducted a desktop image of the Chevrolets EDR.  July 24, 2023  The Chevrolets EDR was analyzed by Sergeant Rumaker.  August 7, 2023  A copy of the Post Mortem Examination from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner was received. (OCME # 23-08763). The autopsy of Sauer was conducted on July 17, 2023 at 0900 hours by Diana Nointin, MD. Sauer sustained a severed head with traumatic avulsion of the brain, fractures of the skull, right humerus, right radius, right ulna, and left metacarpels. Sauer also sustained lacerations and abrasions to her head and extremities along with abrasions on her torso. Sauer sustained contusions of her torso and extremities as well. The toxicology report did not indicate the presence of alcohol or any controlled dangerous substances. There was a reported presence of Metoprolol. According to Medlineplus.gov, Metoprolol is used to treat high blood pressure. It is also used to treat chronic chest pain. Metoprolol is also used to improve survival after a heart attack. Metoprolol is also used in combination with other medications to prevent heart failure. Metoprolol is in a class of medications known as beta blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure. The manner of death was ruled, ACCIDENT.    text-align:center"&gt;   SECTION 7: ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULES  Sergeant Rumaker conducted the analysis of the Electronic Control Module.     SECTION 8: SPEED ANALYSIS  There were no additional speed analysis performed.     SECTION 9: CRASH DYNAMICS:  The Chevrolet was traveling on northbound Rt. 1 in the area of Rock Spring Road, in lane 1. For unknown reasons, the operator lost control and struck the guardrail end which separated northbound from southbound traffic. After striking the guardrail, the Chevrolet began to travel into the southbound lanes where it began to overturn and came to rest on the right shoulder embankment area of southbound traffic.     SECTION 10: ATTACHMENTS  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS WERE ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT:  *Automated Crash Reporting System Report (ACRS)  *Witness/Driver Statements  *MVA Drivers License Printout  *MVA Vehicle Registration Printout  *Autopsy Report   *EDR Supplement  *EDR Supporting Documentation  *Number of photographs uploaded into VeriPic: 128   text-align:center"&gt;  CONCLUSION:  On July 16, 2023, at approximately 1245 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack responded to northbound Rt. 1 (Bel Air Bypass) prior to Rock Spring Road, in Harford County, Maryland to investigate a motor vehicle collision involving a fatality.  During the course of investigation, it was revealed that the operator of the Chevrolet drifted to the left of lane 1 and struck the guardrail dislodging and destroying the guardrail end. The Chevrolet began to cross the solid yellow lines and into the southbound traffic lanes. While continuing to travel, a section of guardrail that became dislodged began to peel back the drivers door into the interior of the vehicle towards the rear. As the Chevrolet continued to travel northbound, it began to overturn into the southbound lanes where it overturned and slid on its hood for several feet. The Chevrolet began to turn upright as it came to rest on the right shoulder embankment area of southbound Route 1. At which time, Sauers body was ejected from the passenger window. It was discovered that the guardrail portion that peeled back the drivers door, decapitated Sauer and severed her seat belt which caused her to move freely inside of the vehicle during the collision and become ejected.   This case is closed due to the death of at-fault party.    Master Trooper Hasim Johnson Maryland State Police  Golden Ring Barrack 8908 Kelso Drive Essex, MD, 21221 410-780-2700 </NarrativeText>
