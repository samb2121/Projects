         <NarrativeText>MSP un-marked patrol vehicle M-50 is equipped with a mobile recording device. This incident was recorded.   Defendant: Timothy Cottrell Zeiler Jr. Date of Birth: 11/05/1992 MD DL: Z-460-793-122-851 Date of Arrest: 05/18/2023 Time of Arrest: 2346 (11:46 PM)  DUI #: 23-046 (JFK HighwayBarrack)   TRAINING/CERTIFICATIONS:    I am trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am trained and certified to conduct preliminary breath tests by the Maryland State Police.    VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):    On May 18, 2022, at approximately 2324 hours, I, TrooperJohnson (#7359) of the Maryland State Police JFK Highway Barrack was dispatched to northbound I-95 in the area of mile marker 74.0, Joppa, Harford County, Maryland to assist Corporal Seiders (#4930) on a traffic stop that he was conducting. At approximately 2332 hours, I arrived on scene and observed a blue GMC Sierra bearing MD registration 2EP2916 at the bottom of the ramp leading form westbound 152 to northbound I-95. The driver of the GMC Sierra was located outside of his vehicle, standing next to the concrete barrier separating the right shoulder from northbound I-95, with Corporal Seiders.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):     I exited my vehicle wearing my full Maryland State Police issued Class-C uniform complete with brass breast badge.I approached Corporal Seiders and asked what information he had on the driver. Corporal Seiders advised me that he conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle and made contact with the driver. Corporal Seiders detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the drivers breath and person. Corporal Seiders explained to me that the driver admitted to consuming a couple of beers at approximately 9:30 PM. The driver advised that he was on his way home from a conference that his employer was holding. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as timothy Cottrell Zeiler Jr. (DOB: 11/05/1992, 2/M). After speaking with Corporal Seiders, I asked him if I was dispatched to assist with Standardized Field Sobriety or if I would be the Trooper administering the tests to Zeiler. Corporal Seiders advised me that due to him being on overtime and already being assigned to a certain location, that he would like me to administer the tests to Zeiler. I approached Zeiler, introduced myself and asked him to clarify the information that had been told to me by Corpoal Seiders. Zeiler advised me that he was on his way home from a work conference that his employer was holding at Diamondback Brewery (1215 E Fort Ave #008, Baltimore, MD 21230). Zeiler explained that he had consumed a couple of alcoholic beverages, specifically beer. Zeiler advised that he had consumed a couple of beers, along with a double IPA (India pale Ale). I asked Zeiler when the last time he had an alcoholic beverage was, which he stated was approximately 9:30 PM. While speaking toZeiler, I observed him to have slurred speech and hiseyes to bebloodshotand glossy. I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person while standing outside his vehicle. I advised Zeiler that due to the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from hisbreath, and my observations while speaking with him, Corporal Seiders observations prior to the traffic stop and the consumption of alcoholic beverages, that I would like to conduct Standard Field Sobriety Testing to make sure that he is okay to continue driving. Zeiler complied.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):   The tests were performed at the bottom of the ramp leading form westbound 152 to northbound I-95, Joppa, Harford County, Maryland. The surface was dry, level, and clear from any debris. Lighting conditions consisted of the headlight from Corporal Seiders patrol vehicle and my handheld flashlight. Zeiler was positioned in a manner to ensure that headlights from passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Zeiler appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any physical injuries. I asked himthe following questions:  Do you have any Physical Injuries: None.  Do you have any Medical Conditions: None.  Are you taking any Medications: None.  Are you wearing any glasses and/or Contacts: Yes. Zeiler advised me that he did not require them for the purposes of the testing.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed):   The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Zeiler had equal pupil size and equal tracking with no resting nystagmus.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation: Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees: Present in both eyes.   Additionally    Vertical Gaze Nystagmus: Not present    WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed): The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Zeiler stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Lost hisbalance and stepped completely offline on one(1) occasion, had to get back into instructional position at the start of the test.   Walking Stage (1stNine):    Stepped completely offline on steps 7, 8 and 9  Incorrect number of steps - Zeilertook 11steps instead of the instructed 9  Use arms for balance   Turn: Turn was performed properly by Zeiler  Walking Stage (2ndNine):    Stepped completely offline 3 and 4  Incorrect number of steps- Zeilertook 10steps instead of the instructed 9.    ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed):    The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Zeiler stated he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.     Puts foot down on one(1) occasion    ARREST:    Due to the clues observed during Standard Field Sobriety Testing, the Zeilers admission to consuming multiple alcoholic beverages, Corporal Seiders observations prior to the traffic stop, and Zeiler to have bloodshot/glassy eyes, I concluded Zeiler was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2346 hours, I placed Zeiler under arrest for driving while Under the Influence of Alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police JFK Highway Barrack for processing.   Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Zeiler a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights and read it to him in English. Hestated that he understood the form at 0016 hours. Zeiler agreed to take the intoximeter. After the completion of the intoximeter test, Zeiler was explained his results.   INTOXIMETER RESULT:0.09  Zeiler was polite and cooperative during the encounter. Hewas given all copies of pertinent paperwork and picked up by a sober driver.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Status:Supplement Report Case Number: 23-MSP-017744  Suspect:  Timothy Cottrell Zeiler, W/M, DOB: 11/05/1992            2927 Brightwater Lane, Abingdon, Maryland 21009 NARRATIVE: This report is to serve as a supplement to Tpr. Johnsons Incident Report 23-MSP-017744.     On 5/18/2023 at approximately 2318 hours, I, Master Trooper Seiders, was positioned in a right-hand lane closure on the ramp from northbound I-95 to Route 152 with my rear emergency lights activated. The left lane was open and the flow of traffic was steady. I was operating my Maryland State Police assigned unmarked patrol vehicle CE-158 and was in uniform. The construction zone was active. Numerous construction and traffic direction workers were in the immediate area. Several SHA signs and cones were present on the ramp from northbound I-95 to Route 152 advising drivers of the construction zone and proper lane of travel. At that time I noticed a pick-up truck, later identified as a blue GMC Sierra displaying Maryland registration 2EP2916, stop behind my location and in the travel portion of the ramp. I initially believed the GMC was a construction vehicle and assumed the driver was blocking traffic for a reason. However, after a short while the GMC remained stopped in the lane and traffic continued to back up on the ramp. I exited my patrol vehicle and began to walk back to the driver, who was later identified as Timothy Zeiler by his Maryland drivers license, who herein after will be referred to as Zeiler for the purpose of this report. I approached Zeiler on the passenger side and noticed the passenger side window was rolled down. For officer safety reasons I used my flashlight and illuminated Zeiler. I noticed Zeilers eyes appeared to be glassy and bloodshot. He stared straight ahead and locked both hands onto the steering wheel. Just before making contact with Zeiler, he quickly sped off and stopped at the top of the ramp at the stop light. I entered my patrol vehicle as a passing motorist stopped and stated that the driver of the pick-up truck was all over the road on the highway. I exited from my location and positioned myself behind the GMC. Zeiler quickly proceeded straight through the intersection and was merging back onto northbound I-95. I positioned myself behind Zeiler and found it very suspicious that he exited from northbound I-95, traveled across Route 152, and now was merging back onto northbound I-95. I activated my emergency equipment and stopped Zeiler at the bottom of the ramp. I exited my patrol vehicle and approached Zeiler on the passenger side.       I made contact with Zeiler, introduced myself and advised him that the traffic stop was being audio and visually recorded. I asked for his drivers license and the vehicles registration card. As Zeiler searched for the documents I asked why he stopped in the lane on the ramp. Zeiler began speaking however due to the excessive noise from the highway I was unable to hear his explanation. But, as he spoke I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I again noticed that his eyes were bloodshot and appeared to be glassy. I believed that Zeiler was under the influence of alcohol. I asked him to exit the GMC, which he agreed and exited.    I made contact with Zeiler at the front of my patrol vehicle and asked him to continue with his explanation. Zeiler stated that he saw my lights and wanted to be abundantly cautious so he stopped. I asked him why he had exited off the ramp and then immediately merge back onto northbound I-95. Zeiler explained that he was following his GPS. I asked him where he was traveling and Zeiler stated home. He further explained that he lived in Box Hill South and that he lived right down the street, I live about one mile away. I found it very peculiar why Zeiler needed to follow his GPS if he lived so close. As Zeiler spoke I detected a slight slur in his speech and again detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I asked Zeiler how much he had to drink, and he explained that he had three beers and he named a drink which I wasnt able to hear. I explained to Zeiler that I was going to summons an on-duty trooper and have them place him through standardized field sobriety tests. Zeiler understood and he stood on the shoulder as I entered my patrol vehicle.      Via my in-car radio I made contact with MSP JFK Highway police communications, and asked them to summons an on-duty trooper to the traffic stop.       A short time later, Trooper Johnson, MSP JFK Highway Barrack, arrived at the traffic stop. I explained to Tpr. Johnson why I stopped Zeiler, the indicators I observed which led me to believe that Zeiler was under the influence of alcohol and Zeilers explanation that he had consumed alcoholic beverages. As Tpr. Johnson approached Zeiler and began placing him through field sobriety tests I deactivated my front emergency lights and stood by my patrol vehicle.     Tpr. Johnson placed Zeiler under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol and I waited for the tow truck to take possession of the GMC. Once the tow operator removed the GMC from the roadway this concluded my involvement with the above stated case.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
