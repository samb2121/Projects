VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 1/15/2023 at approximately 2358 hours I, TFC. Davis #6728 was on patrol in the area of Smith Street and South Blvd. Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland. While in that area, I observed a gray Subaru Suv. bearing New York registration GSB8129 with an inoperable tag light in front of my position. As I was directly behind the vehicle, I observed the vehicle to be driving in the middle of the two-way road. I observed the vehicle to be drifting left, into what could be possible oncoming vehicle. As the vehicle approached the stop sign located at the intersection of Smith Street at South Blvd, the vehicle came to a stop in the crosswalk. I noted the vehicle remained stopped an extended amount of time prior to proceeding through the intersection. As the vehicle proceeded through the intersection, it accelerated quickly, at which time I activated my emergency equipment. I noted the vehicle to cross the stop sign line for oncoming traffic. At that time the vehicle came to a complete stop in the area of 807 Smith Street, Salisbury Maryland.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the vehicle using a driver side approach. I contacted the operator later identified as Cassi Whalen. I identified myself and the reason for the stop at which time I immediately detected the overwhelming odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from inside the vehicle. As I spoke with Whalen, I noted her speech was lethargic and slurred, and her eyes were glassy. Whalen began to become argumentative over the traffic violations. I returned to my patrol vehicle at which time I requested a second unit to assist with Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  Due to Whalen wanting to see the tag lights, I reproached the vehicle and allowed Whalen to exit the vehicle to observe the inoperable tag light. Upon Whalen exiting the vehicle, I could detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Whalens breath and person. I asked Whalen how many alcoholic beverages she had consumed at which time she responded with not that much.  Based on my observations during initial contact, along with Whalen admitting to consuming alcoholic beverages, I requested her to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Prior to me completely asking Whalen to do Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, she stated I would rather not, no. Due to Whalen not allowing me to finish my sentence, I again asked Whalen if she would consent to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests which she again confirmed she did not want to.  Due to Whalen refusing, I advised Whalen to place her hands behind her back as I used my right hand to secure Whalens right wrist. Whalen immediately responded with No at which time she began pulling away. Whalen began to blade her body towards me in an attempt to face me to prevent from being placed under arrest. As Whalen continued to attempt to pull away, she then faced away and began to attempt to walk away from me. I gave Whalen numerous commands to stop resisting and that she was under arrest, which she continued to refuse to obey. After advising Whalen to stop resisting she refused. As I still maintained control of Whalens right wrist with my left hand, I then was able to get behind Whalen at which time I used my left arm to over hook Whalens left arm. While doing this, Whalen lost her balance resulting in both Whalen and myself colliding with the front of my patrol vehicle prior to landing on the pavement. While on the ground, Whalen was face up at which time, I was able to secure Whalens right wrist in a handcuff. I continued to command Whalen to place her hands behind her back and lay on her stomach with she refused. Due to this, I utilized a muscling technique by rolling Whalen over on to her stomach at which time I secured her left wrist in the handcuffs and placed her into custody.  Whalen was then able to stand up with my assistance at which time she was placed in the front of my patrol vehicle. Whalen was asked if she was injured and needed medical attention at which time she stated she did not. Upon returning to my patrol vehicle, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present prior to placing Whalen in the vehicle  Whalen was transported to Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack for processing. Whalen was read aloud herDR-15 Advice of Right via MVA electronic version while she had a paper copy in front of her.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD Nothing to report.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: Whalen refused the intoximeter test.  Whalen was charged in reference to resisting arrest and brought before a Wicomico County Commissioner Office for her initial appearance where she was held with no bond. Whalen was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and transported to WCDC.  All events occurred in Wicomico County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.     </NarrativeText>
