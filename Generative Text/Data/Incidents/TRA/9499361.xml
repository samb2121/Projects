         <NarrativeText>Unmarked Car B11:Footage recorded.  Body Worn Camera: Footagerecorded. Assisting Troopers/Officers: None.  Attachments: ACRS METERS Citations  Narrative: On 5/3/2023 I was dispatched to a vehicle collision on MD 140 in the area of Simmons Rd. I arrived on scene and observed a single Hyundai bearing MD 1BR6381 off the roadway, having struck a tree. The single occupant and driver of the vehicle was identified by his MD drivers license a Daniel Joseph Kaminski05/11/1982. Checks of his license showed he was suspended for failure to complete DIP and FTA. I issued him the attached citations and completed the attached ACRS.  Checks of Kaminskis stop history showed no citations in the last 4 years for which he could have failed to appear in court. For his last several traffic stops he was issued warnings, leading me to believe the suspension could be erroneous (if he had been suspended for FTC/FTA on his last citation it would be unlikely that he was issued warnings). Kaminski also advised that he had no recollection of being ordered to do driver improvement. He advised that he recently was mailed an automated traffic enforcement from Tennessee for a vehicle which bore a tag similar a vehicle he owned, but he advised that he called the issuing agency and was told the issue was resolved.  All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  Case closed by citation.</NarrativeText>
