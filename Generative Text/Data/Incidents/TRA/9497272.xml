         <NarrativeText>On March 26, 2023, at approximately 0007 hours, I, Sergeant J. Lee ID 2130 of Maryland State Police assigned to the Criminal Enforcement Division, was traveling westbound I-70 west of route 29 in a Maryland State Police unmarked unit CE 164. As I was approaching Bethany Lane, I observed several vehicles that were in front of me and traveling in the same direction coming a sudden slow down. When I came up to the other vehicles, I observed a black Acura bearing Virginia registration UBC 8450 in front of other vehicles traveling approximately 5-10 MPH in a posted speed limit zone of 65 MPH and swerving back and forth from the right shoulder to the far left lane. The other vehicles were unable to get by the Acura due to the swerving and unpredictable movement and after observing the Acuras inability to stay in lane and the slow speed, I initiate a traffic stop by activating my emergency equipment.  After a few seconds, the Acura came to a complete and sudden stop in the middle of the roadway, straddling lanes #1 and #2, and when instructed to move the vehicle to the right shoulder, the driver just stared at me and remained stationary in the roadway. I walked up to the passenger side of the vehicle and had to instruct the driver multiple times to turn the steering wheel to the right, at which time he kept turning the steering wheel to the left, and also had to tell the driver to put the transmission into drive, and to give some gas to move the Acura out of the roadway. After multiple attempts, the driver slowly moved the Acura off the roadway and into the right shoulder. While I was in the process of moving my vehicle to the right shoulder and calling out the traffic stop and the circumstances of the traffic stop to Waterloo barrack, the driver got out of the vehicle and begin to stumble towards my vehicle. The driver was asked multiple times to go back inside the vehicle and after completing the radio transmission, I approached the vehicle from the passenger side.  Upon contacting the driver, later identified as Cory Maurice Tabb DOB 10/26/1993 by his Maryland Drivers License, I detected a very strong odor of perfume or cologne coming from the vehicle. I looked down at the passenger seat and observed a red tube of an unknown make skin care product. I asked where he was going and why was he traveling at such a low speed. The drivers response and speech were low, slurred, garbled, and hard to understand. I asked the driver where he was going and he said he was heading home. I asked the driver if he lived in Randallstown and he said yes. I advised him that he was actually heading away from Randallstown and he just stared at me without any reaction. After observing the incoherent, low, and slurred speech, I asked him whether he was on medication or have a medical condition I should know about. He advised me that he is not on any medications. Due to the possible impairment, I requested a trooper assigned to Waterloo barrack to respond to my location to assist in the investigation and administer the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST). Trooper First Class DuGue ID 5832 assigned to Waterloo barrack arrived on the scene and resume the investigation and proceeded to administer the SFST. The driver was unable to perform a large portion of the SFST due to the inability to maintain his balance and was subsequently detained for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) by Trooper First Class DuGue. The driver was transported to Maryland State Police Waterloo barrack for processing and disposition. All events occurred in Howard County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
