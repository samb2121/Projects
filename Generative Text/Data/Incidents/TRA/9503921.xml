NARRATIVE: DUI#: 23-54-019 (Salisbury Barrack) Malcolmson Pierre (DOB:08/20/1993) Date/time of arrest: 02/05/2023 @ 0027 Hrs  CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING *Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Test through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On February 5,2023 at approximately 0008 hours, I, Tpr.Tenney (#7378) of the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack, was on patrol on north bound Route 13 in the area of Bridgeview St. At that time I observed a black Chevorlet Cruze make a left hand turn from Bridgeview St onto north bound Route 13. Once on north bound Route 13 Cruze was observed swerving approximately 4 times from the center line to the right curb in lane two. One the fourth time the Cruze drove up onto the curb and on the sidewalk positioning approximately half of the vehicle off the road way missing the guardrail by approximately one foot before returning to lane two. The Cruze was displaying Maryland Registration plate 2EV7417. I positioned my patrol car, MSP marked unit E-47 behind the Cruze and activated my emergency equipment. The Cruze came to a stop in lane two prior to Liberty St.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I exited my vehicle wearing my full Maryland State Police issued Class-B uniform, complete with brass breast badge. I approached the Cruze and I identified myself, stating my name, rank, badge number, and informed him that he was being audibly and visually recorded. He acknowledged my presence. I then stated the reason for the traffic stop. As I notified the driver of the violation that occurred he stated ya. At that time, I detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I then asked the driver of the Cruze how much alcohol he had consumed prior to driving. The driver did not provide an answer to the question. I then asked the driver if he had his license and registration. The driver stated Yes. I then asked the driver multiples how much he had to drink. The driver stated that he is not drinking. I asked the driver if he speaks English. The driver stated the he spoke Spanish. While speaking with the driver of the Cruze, I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. The driver provided me with his International drivers license, which I identified him as Malcolmson Pierre (DOB:08/20/1993). The photo on the license matched the drivers appearance. I then contacted Maryland State Police Language Line to assist with translation of Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. All directions and instructions here after are communicated in both English and Spanish using the translation line. I then reproached the Cruze and asked Pierre to step out of the vehicle and proceed to the front of his vehicle for further investigation. Once outside the vehicle and while speaking with Pierre I detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I then asked Pierre if he would like to perform Standardize Field Sobriety Testing. Pierre stated ok, Si   Pierre was instructed to stand in front of his vehicle facing towards me and to keep his head still while following the tip of my pen with his eyes.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  1. Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  2. Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  3. Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  Pierre took a drink of the soda that he removed from his vehicle. I then instructed him to set the bottle on the ground. At the time, Pierre set the bottle on the ground. I then instructed Pierre to put his feet together and keep his arms down at his side. Pierre immediately positioned himself as instructed.  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was observed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  Do you have any medical conditions? Pierre answered No.  Do you have any pre-existing injuries? Pierre stated No  Do you take any medications? Pierre answered No  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  Prior to Pierre performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Pierre was instructed to place his left foot on an imaginary straight line and place his right foot on the same line in front of his left foot with the heel of his right foot touching the toes of his left foot. Pierre was to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in his position until he was told to begin. Pierre was instructed to take nine (9) steps on the straight-line touching heel to toe on each step. Pierre was told to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step out loud. After completing his ninth step Pierre was demonstrated and explained to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around his lead foot with his rear foot to turn completely around. Pierre was then explained and demonstrated to take nine more heel to toe steps on the same line in the opposite direction of the first nine steps. The second nine steps were to be performed identical to the first nine steps. Pierre was instructed that once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was complete. Pierre was again instructed to keep he hands down at his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Pierre if he had and questions before beginning the test. Pierre No  The results were as follows:  Instruction stage:   Cannot keep balance/ breaks feet apart. Pierre broke his feet from the starting position on one occasion.  Beginning test prior to instruction once.    Walking Stage (first nine): 1. Steps off line on 3. 3. Incorrect number of steps.
