         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera Defendant: Jerrell Antwan Green   TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,000 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On January 26, 2023 at approximately 2314 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on Stemmers Run prior to Old Eastern, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a black Nissan Altima make a wide right turn onto Stemmers Run in front of my patrol vehicle. The Nissan was bearing Florida registration DFKX58. The Nissan made a right turn on westbound Old Eastern and was swerving left and right. The Nissan approached a steady red light at Eastern Blvd. The Nissan made a right turn onto Eastern without coming to a stop at the steady red light. The Nissan was swerving left and right while on Eastern. The Nissan jerked left onto the dotted white line prior to moving right and merging onto Martin Blvd. The Nissan was delayed in turning left with the curve in the roadway and went right onto the fog line, then left. The Nissan was swerving left and right:    Right over fog line onto the right shoulder with both passenger side tires, jerked left. Right on dotted white line, left.   Right on fog line, left.   Left towards dotted white line, right.   Right on dotted white line, left towards dotted white line.   I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the Nissan as it made a right onto Transverse Ave.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Nissan on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle. There was a female in the front passenger seat and a male in the back seat. I explained the reason for the stop and requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He asked if he was jerking onto the shoulder. He was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Jerrell Antwan Green. While speaking with Green, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I deliberately observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. His speech was slurred. I returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Nissan and requested Green to exit his vehicle and walk to the rear. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking with Green outside the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about alcohol consumption prior to driving, he stated 1 drink earlier (Angry Orchard at about 8 oclock). I informed Green that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed at the location of the stop.The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a black hat, black sweatshirt, blue sweatpants and black/white Nike shoes (tied).  I asked Green the following questions:  Glasses or contacts No Medication  No Head Injuries  No Problems with knees or ankles  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Green stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage:  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on step 4.  Stepped completely offline on steps 1, 4 and 7.  Turn: Spun left in one motion. Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on step 2.   Stepped completely offline by more than a shoe width on steps 4 and 7.  Stopped after falling left on step 7 to regain balance.   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Green stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. -Right foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Hopped on left foot.  Right foot hit the ground 1 time.  Seconds 11-20:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Hopped on left foot.  Seconds 21-30:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Hopped on left foot.  Right foot hit the ground 1 time.  He continued to tell me that he did everything that I asked him to do, but did not realize all the clues of impairment that he was displaying.  PBT refused.  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Green was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2334 hours, I placed Green under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Green with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. He listened to the DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website At 0026hours, Green agreed to take a breath test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Wilson beginning at 2342 hours. A preliminary search of Wilson was conducted and it revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Wilson was observed from the time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by TFC Wilson of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Wilson had a result of .10 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0036 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****.10 grams of alcohol****  Green was polite and cooperative. He was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  On 1/26/2023 I, TFC Wilson #6512, assisted Cpl Wallace on a traffic stop on Transverse Ave just off of Martin Blvd in Essex, Baltimore County. As a result from the stop and scene investigation, the operator, Jerrell Green, was arrested for DUI. Green was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing. After Green was advised his rights per DR-15 he elected to submit to an alcohol concentration test. I operated the intoximeter test for Green. Green was provided proper instruction on how to submit to the test. His first breath sample was insufficient with an immediate drop-off of flow and volume. Green was reminded of the instructions and on his second attempt provided a sufficient sample which had good flow and volume. Greens third attempt began with good flow but then dropped and was logged as insufficient. Green was again reminded on the instruction and to provide consistent flow. One Greens fourth attempt, it had good flow and volume.    After successfully submitting to the intoximeter test, his official result was .10 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Green was served with his official result and provided a copy of the MSP Form 33 and ER/IR II signed test receipt. All documents were properly signed, and the test was properly logged.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
