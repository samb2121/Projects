         <NarrativeText>           *STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera  Defendant: Rupert George Knight  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,000 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On April 30, 2023 at approximately 0020 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on southbound Liberty Road prior to Owings Mills Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a black Toyota SUV swerved left into the turn lane, then right into the right lane. The Toyota came to a stop in the travel lane with the right tires over the fog line, partially on the right shoulder. The Toyota was obstructing the free passage on the roadway. A white SUV stopped behind the Toyota, then pulled next to the Toyota. The white SUV pulled away and the Toyota attempted to accelerate away. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Toyota.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Toyota on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the only occupant in the vehicle. I explained the reason for the stop and requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He dropped his Visa card and multiple cards when attempting to retrieve his drivers license. He stated that his wife told him to pull over. He was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Rupert George Knight. While speaking with Knight, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I deliberately observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. He had difficulty retrieving his registration card and dropped papers from the glove box. I returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.   I returned to the Toyota and requested Knight to exit his vehicle and walk to the rear. He complied and exited his vehicle. He placed his hand on his vehicle for balance. While speaking with Knight outside of the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about alcohol consumption prior to driving, he stated that it was his mother-in-laws birthday party. I asked him again and he stated that he had a couple drinks (vodka). His speech was slurred. Stated he had maybe 3 all night and started at 8. I informed Knight that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He was wearing a red/black suit jacket, black slacks and black dress shoes (tied).  I asked Knight the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  Glasses in suit jacket, not on. Head Injuries  No Medication  No Problems with knees or ankles  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes     Looked away when instructed to keep his head still.   Stated he was a social drinker (mumbled).  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Knight stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage:    Could not follow instructions on how to stand     Continued to lose his balance left and right.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on all steps.  Stepped completely offline on all steps.  Took 10 steps when instructed to take 9.  Stopped after step 10.  Turn: Turned left using both feet Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on all steps.  Stepped completely offline on all steps.  Took 11 steps when instructed to take 9.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. -Right foot raised. Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: Initially did not raise his foot off the ground, but was counting.    Swayed body to the left and right.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from side for balance.  Fell back and left, right foot hit the ground 1 time.  PBT #209455 with a result of .15 BrAC.  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Knight was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0036 hours, I placed Knight under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Baltimore County Towson Precinct for processing.  Upon arrival at the precinct, I provided Knight with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Knight listened to the DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. At 0119hours, Knight agreed to take a breath test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Knight beginning at 0036 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Knight was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Officer Pugh of the Baltimore County Police on a certified instrument. Knight had a result of .17 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0134 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****.17 grams of alcohol****  Knight was polite and cooperative during the encounter. Knight was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released into the lobby to wait for his wife. Knight vomited multiple times while in the lobby.   All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
