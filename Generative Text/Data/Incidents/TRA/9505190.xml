         <NarrativeText>DUI Case #23-109 Stop was recorded by my state issued body camera. Title on Evidence.com23-MSP-014240.  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2016. * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impairment Detection, June 2017  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion On April 22, 2023, at approximately 0336 hours, I, TFC Skrodinsky was dispatched to a vehicle collision at 3818 Norrisville Road, Jarrettsville, MD 21084.I arrived on scene and observed a gray Honda Accord displaying Maryland registration 7EV7079 that had run off the road to the left, struck a pole, overturned, and came to a final rest on its roof.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact I contacted the driver of the Accord in the rear of the ambulance. The driver was later identified through his name and date of birth and MVA photo as Ryan Alexander Aiken (DOB: 05/28/2004, 5/M). I asked Aiken what happened in the collision and he stated he was on his way home from his friends house in Forest Hill and took the turn too fast. I immediately observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy and detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage. I asked Aiken how many alcoholic beverages he consumed and he responded 3 drinks. I asked Aiken what time did he consume his last drink and he answered around 12 (midnight). I allowed EMS to finish their evaluation and Aiken refused any medical treatment. Once out of the ambulance I stood directly in front of Aiken and I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. Based on the above observations, I asked Aiken to perform standardized field sobriety tests, which he agreed.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening The evaluation was performed on the side of MD-23. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight and my vehicles headlights. My vehicles front emergency lights were deactivated during all Field Sobriety Testing.    Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12-15 inches from Aikens eyes, slightly above his eye level. Aiken was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. I held the stimulus in front of Aikens eyes in order to check for resting nystagmus, which was not present.   Lack of smooth pursuit  Both eyes Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation  Both eyes Onset nystagmus prior to 45 degrees  Both eyes  Walk and Turn  6 of 8 Clues Prior to Aiken performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Aiken if he understood the test and he advised he did.  Instructional Stage:   Balance  Aiken stepped out of the instructional stance multiple times   Started Too Soon  Aiken leaned forward to begin to test before being instructed to do so  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Raised Arms for Balance  Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5  Number of Steps - 11  Turn:    Completed turn unsuccessful  Aiken pivoted on his toes, he did not take a series of small steps.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Missed Heel to Toe  Step 3  Raised Arms for Balance  Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4   One Leg Stand  3of 4 Clues Prior to Aiken performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Aiken if he understood the test and he stated, yes. Instruction Stage:    Aiken practiced the test before being told to begin  Balance Stage: 0-10 Seconds:    Put foot down  Raised Arms for Balance  Swayed to the left side  11-20 Seconds:    Raised Arms for Balance  21-30 Seconds:    Put foot down  Raised Arms for Balance  PBT 0.18  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Aiken was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0416 hours, I placed Aiken under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Aiken was handcuffed with his hands behind his back, so that he may not place anything in his mouth. I conducted a preliminary search that revealed he had nothing in his mouth. I transported Aiken to the Bel Air Barrack for processing. While in route to the barrack, my vehicle filled with the odor of an alcoholic beverage. Also, in route, I played the DR-15 audio from the MVAs website. Upon arrival at the barrack, I finished reading the DR-15 from. At the conclusion of the form, Aiken agreed to submit to the intoximeter.   20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD I conducted the 20-minute observation period of Aiken which began with his arrest. I observed Aiken from this time until he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The intoximeter test was administered by Cpl Workman, a certified intoximeter operator of the Maryland State Police, on a certified instrument (S/N: 011759).  INTOXIMETER RESULT ****.15BRAC**** Aiken had a result of .15 BRAC at 0452hours. He was given all copies of pertinent paperwork to include DUI citations and was released from the Bel Air Barrack.  Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland </NarrativeText>
