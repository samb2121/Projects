As I requested Cotters driver license and registration, I observed him struggle with basic coordination around the vehicle. Cotter stated that he had come from Rock Spring Deli.

As I questioned Cotter further, I observed him become more agitated. Cotter would admit that he smokes Weed but would not provide more details. As I spoke to Cotter, I observed him lacking eye contact. Cotter was not honesty answering my questions. Cotter denied and drug use. As I continued to speak with Cotter, his level of sobriety remained consistent throughout my observations of him. I asked Cotter if he would submit tor SFSTs, he would reply yes.
