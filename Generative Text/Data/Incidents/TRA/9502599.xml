         <NarrativeText>This incident was recorded, H-8 equipped with an in-car camera system. TFC Husseys #6913 and Tpr. Hughes #7578 BWC.  Defendant: Garcia Jr, Rafael Antonio  Date of Birth: 09/18/1975  Location: 2190 Crain Hwy, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601  Drivers License #: G-620-730-067-724  DUI #: 23-004  2nd DUI  Refused Intox  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police.  * Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.).  * Traffic Safety Specialist  Designation I  NARRATIVE/ VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):  On 01/09/2023 at approximately 2203 hours, I, TFC Hussey #6913 (FTT) and Tpr. Hughes #7578 with the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack was dispatched to a motor vehicle collision in the parking lot of IHOP located at 2190 Crain Hwy, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601. Deputy #733 with the Charles County Sheriffs Office assisted on the scene. Upon my arrival, I observed a black Infiniti Q50 bearing Maryland Registration 2DS0355 with drivers side damage by the front tire.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  Deputy #733 advised he observed the driver had slow/ lethargic movements with bloodshot eyes.  I made contact with the driver and identified him by his Maryland Drivers License as Garcia Jr, Rafael Antonio, B/M, DOB: 09/18/1975. I asked Garcia how did the collision occurred and he advised he was traveling in the slow lane (Lane #3) and a car side swiped him on the drivers side. The only drivers side damage was on the lower side of the vehicle which another vehicle would not have caused. While speaking with Garcia, I observed his eyes were bloodshot and glassy and spoke with mumbled speech. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Garcias breath and person while speaking with him. I asked Garcia where he was coming from and he advised he was coming from the Tinder Box located at 2754 Crain Hwy, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601. I asked Garcia how much has he had to drink and he shrugged his shoulders and stated, A little bit. I asked Garcia what he was drinking and he stated, Nothing to heavy. I asked Garcia when he arrived at the Tinder Box and he advised around 8:30pm. While speaking with Garcia, I observed he struggled with his balance of standing strait and would sway.  There were markings on the roadway from Garcias vehicle, showing that Garcia collided into the curb.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  I requested Garcia to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he agreed to take. I asked Garcia if he is a diabetic or has high blood pressure, and he stated, No, I am not. I asked Garcia if he wears contacts or glasses and he advised no. I asked Garcia if he has any type of blindness or issues with his eyes and he advised he does not. I asked Garcia if he takes any daily medication, and he advised he does not. I then asked Garcia if he has had any recent head injuries like a concussion, and he advised no. I then asked Garcia if he has had any recent leg injuries or disabilities to his legs and he advised no. I then asked Garcia if his shoes were comfortable and tied to his satisfaction and he advised they were.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST: (6/6 clues observed).  Garcia displayed equal pupil size, equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus in both eyes.  Garcia displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  Garcia displayed Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  Garcia displayed Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  VERTICAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS:  Garcia displayed vertical Nystagmus in both eyes.  Garcia had difficulty not moving his head while following the stimulus and had to be reminded several times. Garcia swayed throughout the test.  WALK AND TURN: Test refused  I attempted to explained and demonstrate the test to Garcia and how the test should be performed, but he refused to take the test after he broke the instructional stage position.  ONE LEG STAND: Test refused.  Arrest:  -Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person  -The clues displayed on the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests  -Admitting to consuming alcoholic beverages  -Colliding into a curb  -Swaying while standing  Garcia was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol at 2239 hours.
