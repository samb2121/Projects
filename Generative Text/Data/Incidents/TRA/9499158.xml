         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-365 R HOLLAND JR. ID: 23-MSP-023707 Defendant: Marrun Clifford Holland Jr. *****Subsequent Offender***** TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On July 2, 2023 at approximately 0305 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on the Inner Loop of I-695 in the area of Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a black Dodge Durango failing to drive within a single lane and traveling above the posted speed limit. The Dodge was bearing Maryland registration 4FF0524.    Right over solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Right over solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Right over solid white fog line with approximately half the width of the Dodge.  Drove on solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.  Right over dotted white lane line with approximately half the width of the Dodge.  Observed speed at 81-MPH in a 55-MPH speed zone.  The Dodge accelerated away from my patrol vehicle at what appeared to be above the posted 55 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar, which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 81 MPH in a posted 55 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on Maryland 83 at Old Pimlico Road.  The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Dodge on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the sole occupant. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Marrun Clifford Holland Jr. While speaking with Holland Jr., I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Dodge and requested Holland Jr. to exit his vehicle. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking to Holland Jr. outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Holland Jr. denied consuming any alcoholic beverages. I informed Holland Jr. that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of Maryland 83. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a shirt, jeans, and shoes.  I asked Holland Jr. the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None. Physical Injuries  None. Medication  None. Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.     Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.     Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (2/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Holland Jr. stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Holland Jr. removed his shoes for the test.  Instructional Stage:    Broke the instructional position to the right twice.  Walking Stage (1stNine):     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing observed.  Turn:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Did not complete turn as instructed.  Walking Stage (2ndNine):     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing observed.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Holland Jr. stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Holland Jr. still had his shoes removed during this test.  -Right foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Second 0-10:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing observed.  Seconds 11-20:    Used arms to maintain balance.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Placed raised right foot on the ground.  Seconds 21-30: Holland Jr. stopped performing the test and now stated he was in a car accident on June 24th, which is why he is no longer able to perform the test. Holland Jr. stated he injured his wrist and ankle in the car collision. During the medical questions, Holland Jr. only disclosed a wrist injury.  PBT #70005012: Refused.   ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Holland Jr. was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0329 hours, I placed Holland Jr. under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Baltimore County Police Department  Towson Precinct for further processing.  Upon arrival at the Towson Precinct, I provided Holland Jr. with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Holland Jr. was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights. At 0404 hours, Holland Jr. refused to take a breath test.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****REFUSAL*****  Holland Jr. was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
