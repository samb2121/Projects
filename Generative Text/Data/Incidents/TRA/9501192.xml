         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack N Marked MSP vehicle N-15 In-Car and Body Camera Operational   Defendant: Manuel De Jesus Guevara Gomez  Date of Birth: 12/12/2000  Date of Arrest: 01/02/2023  Time of Arrest: 2021 hours  DUI #: 24-002 (Rockville Barrack)  CERTIFICATION  TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement through the Maryland State Police.   VEHICLE INVOLVED (PHASE 1) On 01/02/2024 at approximately 1920 hours, I (TFC Satterfield #7216) was dispatched to a report of a passenger vehicle stopped in the right lane on I-270 near Germantown Road. Upon my arrival, I noticed a Silver Hyundia Elantra bearing Maryland registration 3FJ5730 stopped in the auxiliary lane on Southbound I-270 prior to the exit to Germantown Road.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the driver identified as Manuel Guevara Gomez (H/M DOB 12/12/2000) by his Maryland Drivers License. Immediately upon approaching the vehicle, I smelled a strong odor acholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I asked Guevara Gomez where he was coming from to which he just stated Maryland. I then asked where in Maryland, to which he replied Maryland again. As I spoke with Guevara Gomez, I also noticed a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I asked Guevara Gomez how many drinks he had tonight to which he responded Mucho. Guevara Gomez also advised thathe knew he was drunk and was DUI. Officer Paulino #3212 from Montgomery County Police department responded and hereafter, all statements to and from Guevara Gomez were translated by Officer Paulino. Guevara Gomez admitted that he drank five Modelos and that he was driving and stopped in the middle of the road because he did not feel good. I asked Guevara Gomez if he would consent to perform field sobriety tests to determine if he was okay to drive to which he agreed to.  PRE- ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the SouthboundI-270 near Germantown Road. The surface was dry and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, and my flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Guevara Gomez did not display any visible injuries. All the SFST were demonstrated to Guevara Gomez before his attempts.Guevara Gomez stated he had no injuries or physical impairment that would prevent him from completing the tests.  I asked the following questions: Medical Conditions  No Injuries  None Medication  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 CLUES) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. My fingertip was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Guevara Gomezs eyes. Guevara Gomez was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Guevara Gomez pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I asked Guevara Gomez if he understood the directions and he stated that he did.Guevara Gomez was positioned away from passing traffic to ensure the results of the HGN test were not compromised.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed) Prior to Guevara Gomez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Guevara Gomez was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Guevara Gomez was instructed to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Guevara Gomez was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Guevara Gomez was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Guevara Gomez was demonstrated and explained to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Guevara Gomez was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Guevara Gomez was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Guevara Gomez if he completely understood the instructions to which headvised he did.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Cannot keep balance  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on multiple steps 2.) Stops while walking (took long pause after every step) 3. Incorrect number of steps (Took 20)   Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on multiple steps 2.) Stops walking (long pause after every step) 3.) Incorrect number of steps (Took 15)  Turn: Guevara Gomez completed the turn improperly. He did not take a series of small steps to turn around but instead made short choppy robotic movement stop turn around.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 CLUES) Prior to Guevara Gomez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Guevara Gomez was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. Guevara Gomez was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Guevara Gomez was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he advised he did.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Nothing to report  Seconds 11-20: 1.) Put foot down multiple times. 2.) Swayed  Seconds 21-30 1.) Put foot down multiple times.  2.) Swayed  Guevara Gomez refused to submit to a preliminary breath test   ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Guevara Gomez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from breath. * Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages * Vehicle stopped in the middle of the highway * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests   I arrested Guevara Gomez for driving under the influence of alcohol at 2021 hours and he was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Rockville Barrack for processing. At the barrack, I gave Guevara Gomez a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to follow along as he listened to the audio form being read to him in its entirety. At the conclusion of the form, Guevara Gomez refused to submit to the intoximeter test and refused to sign the DR-15 indicating the same (2117 hours).    INTOXIMETER RESULT REFUSAL  INCIDENT DURING PROCESSING  On 01/02/2024 at approximately 2212 hours, I, TFC Satterfield #7216 attempted to handcuff an arrestee that was placed in Rockville Barracks holding cell in order to transport him to the Seven Locks Adult Detention Center. Originally, at 2153 hours, the arrestee, Guevara Gomez was placed in the holding cell to use the bathroom and to wait for his ride while I concluded DUI processing. The arrestee became increasingly irritable and aggressive and wanted out of the cell. The arrestee would knock on the cell door to get the attention of myself or SGT Saucerman. The arrestee was told multiple times by myself and SGT Saucerman to sit down on the cell bench and he would be let out when his ride arrived. The arrestee did not obey directions and continued to bang on the cell door more aggressively each time. I even used a translation tool so the arrestee could understand what the directions were in an attempt to de-escalate his behavior. .The subject had become disruptive and continued to strike the door to the cell. . TFC Yarbrough #7291 and I were preparing to open the door to the cell. We observed the arrestee crouched down directly in front of the door appearing to wait for the door to open.  As we opened the door, the arrestee immediately lunged toward TFC Yarbrough and I, the subject additionally began reaching to grab our head and neck area with his hands. TFC Yarbrough and I pushed the subject back into the cell where he began to violently resist us. The arrestee attempted to grab TFC Yarbroughs gun. I grabbed the arrestee near the upper portion of his body and attempted to force him to the ground while TFC Yarbrough had control of his legs. In the process, the arrestee began fighting with me and attempted to gouge my eyes by shoving his available hand and fingers into my face. The arrestee eventually scratched my face which caused a noticeable laceration to my forehead.  SGT Saucerman left the Duty Officer station and assisted moments later and the arrestee continued to violently resist all three of us by attempting to poke me in the eye and refusing to relax arms and body to effectively put handcuffs on. The arrestee also attempted to grab each of our weapons. I used open hand techniques in an attempt to subdue the arrestee and put handcuffs on him. I grabbed one of his hands and he would try reaching for my face with his other hand. I was able to pin the arrestee to the floor and put one handcuff on him. At this time, the arrestee was on his back. I then rolled the arrestee over by grabbing the back of his shirt and was able to get a second pair of handcuffs on as he continued to violently resist by attempting to grab our faces and again poke me in the eye.   When the arrestee was handcuffed Montgomery County officers responded to the barrack to assist with transport. Montgomery County officers placed leg restraints on the arrestee and placed them in their vehicle that was equipped with a cage. The arrestee was transported to Central Processing Unit by Montgomery County Sheriffs as I followed.   All events occurred in Montgomery County, State of Maryland.               </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 1/2/2024 at approximately 2037 hours, I was the late shift Duty Officer at the time when TFC Satterfield arrived at the Rockville Barrack with a DUI arrest that resulted from a disabled vehicle in the roadway. The DUI subject was identified as Manuel De Jesus Guevara Gomez, 23 year old Hispanic male. At 2153 hours, while being processed at the barrack, Guevara Gomez was placed in the barrack temporary holding cell to use the bathroom, and to wait for his ride. TFC Satterfield left Guevara Gomez in the holding cell while he finalized the DUI paperwork. During this time, Guevara Gomez became increasingly impatient, and aggressive by punching the window of the holding cell, and wanting to be let out of the holing cell. Guevara Gomez would constantly tap on the cell door until either myself or TFC Satterfield gave him attention and answered his question. Guevara Gomez indicated he wanted to be let out of the cell and go outside. TFC Satterfield and myself explained to him numerous times that since was still under arrest, he would not be let out of the cell until his ride came to the barrack to pick him up. On several occasions, Guevara Gomez was advised that his ride was on the way, and was told to sit on the bench in the cell, and just wait until his ride arrived. Guevara Gomez became increasingly agitated and punched the window of the holding cell on several occasions.  At approximately 2212 hours, TFC Satterfield and TFC Yarbrough went to open the cell door, Guevara Gomez attempted to push TFC Satterfield away and escape the holding cell.  I was talking to a citizen at the front desk when I heard TFC Satterfield and TFC Yarbrough begin struggling with Guevara Gomez. I ran over and assisted with placing Guevara Gomez back in handcuffs. TFC Satterfield and TFC Yarbrough had Guevara Gomez pinned in the left corner of the cell on the bench, attempting to place handcuffs on him. I used muscling techniques to gain control of Guevara Gomezs right wrist, while TFC Satterfield placed a handcuff on Guevara Gomezs left wrist. Guevara Gomez was actively resisting and refusing to place his right arm behind his back. TFC Satterfield and TFC Yarbrough gave commands for Guevara Gomez to place his arm behind his back and stop resisting. When Guevara Gomez was taken to the ground, I lost control of his right wrist, but was able to gain control of his left wrist using a soft empty hand technique, to keep control of the handcuffed arm. We moved Guevara Gomez into the cell hallway where he was moved onto his back. I maintained control of Guevara Gomezs left wrist until he was fully handcuffed and secured. Once Guevara Gomez was secured all use of force stopped.   Montgomery County Police arrived at the barrack to assist with a cage car. Once Guevara Gomez was secured, he was immediately taken out of the barrack and placed in a Montgomery County Police cage car. After he was seated, I noticed a small amount of fresh blood above Guevara Gomezs right eye, on his eye lid. Montgomery County EMS arrived at the barrack to treat the scratch, but Guevara Gomez became argumentative and uncooperative and refused treatment. Guevara Gomez was transported to Montgomery County CPU.   This concluded my part of the incident.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #2 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 01/02/2024 at approximately 2212 hours, I, TFC Yarbrough #7291, was assisting TFC Satterfield #7216 with handcuffing a suspect in the cell to transport them to Montgomery County Central Processing Unit. Upon approach of the cell I noticed the suspect was bent down by the door trying to hide. I told TFC Satterfield to be ready if he tries anything. Upon opening the cell door, the suspect lunged out of the cell trying to get out. Myself and TFC Satterfield attempted to stop him but he kept resisting by pushing are arm back and trying to get out. I pushed the suspect back into the cell with an open hand technique when he started to resist more. I gave verbal commands to not do that and stop. I got in the cell and used a soft open hand technique by grabbing the suspects arm and pulling him back into the cell in an attempt to get him under control. I then grabbed his legs and pinned him onto the bench. The suspect at this time attempted to grab my firearm. I shouted that he was going for my gun. I grabbed his left arm and held it down. While the suspect attempted to grab my firearm I performed close fist strikes to the left side of his torso. At this time Sgt. Saucerman #4873 came into the cell to assist. I grabbed the suspects legs to try and get the suspect to the ground. Once on the ground I held his legs to restrain him from kicking and twisting. I pinned his legs to the ground using my body weight and arms. Once the suspect was moved out of the cell I went to the suspects right side to assist in handcuffing him. I grabbed his right arm and pulled it behind his back. Once behind his back I put my knee on the center of his shoulder blades and left hand on his left shoulder. Once handcuffed, I lifted the suspect up off the ground by his left arm and escorted him to the Montgomery County Officers cage car. This concluded my role in the incident.  All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
