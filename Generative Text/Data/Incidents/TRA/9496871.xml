         <NarrativeText>Incident was captured on BWC. Please note, for patient confidentiality, my BWC was not activated while in Sinai Hospital. Therefore, the reading of the DR-15 and the blood kit was not captured on video.  ***Please note: Times reflected in the CAD report will be inconsistent due to CAD being offline at the time of the incident***  Defendant: Peter Joseph MUSTO Date of Birth: 05/03/1983 Date of Arrest: 03/28/2023 Times of Arrest: 1801 hours MD DL #: M-230-680-441-339  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On Tuesday March 28, 2023, at approximately 1748 hours, I (TFC Eckhardt #6469), was on duty and in uniform when the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack dispatched me to a report of a single vehicle collision into a telephone pole. The area of the collision provided was Route 32 (Sykesville Road) in the area of Nicodemus Road.  Upon my arrival, I observed fire apparatus from the Gamber Fire Company and an Ambulance from Reese Fire Company in the roadway. I then observed a Maroon Honda Odyssey off of the roadway, on top of a broken tree and alongside a downed fence on the property of 3018 Sykesville Road. The Honda had heavy front-end damage and full airbag deployment. I observed EMS personnel tending to a white male who was kneeling on the ground near the Honda. The male had what appeared to be a moderate amount of blood on his face and arms.  The scene was evident that the Honda was traveling south on Route 32, when it failed to negotiate the left-handed bend in the roadway. Following the tire tracks, the Honda left the roadway to the right, striking support wires for a BGE pole. The Honda continued southbound off road where it struck a small tree and shrubbery as well as a fence, in front of 3018 Sykesville Road. I observed the Honda to be displaying Maryland Registration 2DB7596.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the male who was now being strapped to a backboard and stretcher by EMS. I stood by as EMS was tending to the male. The paramedic on Medic 98 looked at me and said ETOH (Alcohol) was on board based on her observations. I asked the Paramedic if she had the males identification. She requested the males ID which he removed from his wallet. He was identified by his Maryland Drivers License as Peter Joseph Musto. I got close to Musto and I could immediately detect an overwhelming odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I further observed his blue eyes to be extremely bloodshot and glassy.  Once Musto was placed inside the ambulance, I attempted to briefly speak with him. I asked him how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed to which he stated, Two beers. He estimated the beers to have been consumed about an hour prior to the collision. It was unclear where he was coming from but he did state that he went out after work and was on his way home. While Musto spoke, I detected his speech to be thick and slurred.  Due to Mustos injuries, EMS determined to have him transported to the hospital via Trooper 3. Due to the nature of this incident, SFSTs were not attempted.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) N/A  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe MUSTO was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely:  * Drove off of the roadway into several stationary objects. * Bloodshot and glassy eyes. * Overwhelming odor of an alcoholic beverage. * Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages.  Due to the number of observations, I concluded MUSTO was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 1801 hours, I placed MUSTO under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Musto was flown to Sinai Hospital. I responded to Sinai Hospital to make further contact with Musto.  While at Sinai, I observed Musto to be still attached to a backboard and neck collar. Due to this, I still did not attempt SFSTs. I advised Musto of his arrest and explained that I was going to read him the DR-15 Advice of Rights and afterwards would ask if he would submit or refuse a blood test. As I was beginning to read the DR-15 Advice of Rights, Musto stopped me and stated, You dont need to read all of that. He then stated, I know I fucked up. Ill do the test. I advised Musto that by law I still had to read him the form verbatim.  I then read the Maryland DR-15 Advice of Rights verbatim to MUSTO. At 1920 hours, MUSTO agreed to take the blood test.  Mustos blood was drawn by Sinai ER Nurse L. Bouthner #100072037, utilizing MSP Blood Kit #G-448. She drew his blood from his right A.C. at 1927 hours. I witnessed the entire blood draw. I then packaged, labeled, and sealed the blood kit, all in accordance with Maryland State Police policy and procedure. The blood kit was placed in the U.S. Mail to be sent for testing.  Musto was provided copies of all pertinent paperwork prior to me leaving the hospital.  I completed the ACRS report for the collision.  While I was on scene, fire department personnel provided me contact information for a witness that had to leave prior to my arrival. I made contact with Hannah Frey via telephone. Frey explained that she was traveling north on Route 32 to pick her child up from school. While she was just north of Nicodemus Road, she observed a maroon van traveling towards her in the southbound lane. She described the van to be traveling quite fast. She observed the van then veer to the right, leaving the roadway and striking the BGE pole support and tree. She turned her vehicle around and called 911. Upon stopping at the scene, the resident at 3018 Sykesville Road came outside and assisted the driver of the van (Musto) out of the vehicle and started to tend to his injuries. Due to the fact she had to pick her child up from school, she provided her information to the fire department and then left.  I did take photographs of the scene prior to the tow trucks arrival. The photographs were uploaded into Veripic.  I respectfully request this case to remain open, and placed on a 90 day supplement cycle, pending the blood kit results.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On August 14th, 2023, I received the Blood Test Results for Musto. The blood results conclusion is as follows:    Blood specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of 0.20 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.  I contacted Musto, and he agreed to meet with me at the Westminster Barrack on August 24th, 2023.  On August 24th, 2023, I met with Musto in the lobby of the Westminster Barrack. I issued Musto a copy of the blood results, a DR-15A, the appropriate Etix Citations, and a must appear form. He was also provided a copy of the DR-15 that he signed, consenting to the blood test. Musto was cooperative but obviously annoyed. I explained to Musto all the forms and his blood results. Musto argued that he suffered a brain injury from the crash and argued that I asked him about the blood test after scuffing said injury. As stated in my original narrative, while at the hospital, Musto was awake and responsive, and I was able to determine he was in a correct state of mind due to his statements of not wanting me to read him the DR-15 because he knew that he had messed up. He also stated that he was willing to take the test, prior to me completing the DR-15 requesting such, which is indicative that he was aware of the situation and circumstances of such.  *** Please note: I dated the citations and DR-15A as todays date (08/24/2023) in order to award Musto his rights through the MVA for a hearing. There is a flaw in the Delta and MVA system that, when citations are back dated, it automatically suspends the drivers license and shows a suspension code for failing to comply.***  The follow up with Musto was recorded on my BWC.  All copies of pertinent paperwork have been attached to this report.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.  Case closed by citation.</NarrativeText>
