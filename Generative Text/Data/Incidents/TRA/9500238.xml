Yu stopped the vehicle and this was when I came into contact with the suspect vehicle, a tan Toyota Corolla bearing Maryland registration, 3DK0264.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  See TFC. Yu supplement narrative.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I first talked to TFC. Yu and he advised that he could detect the odor of alcohol and the drivers eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I approached the vehicle via a drivers side approach and made contact with the male operator. I asked the male for his insurance card and asked where he was coming from. He advised he was coming from his sisters house. I asked if he spoke English and he stated, A little bit. As he spoke, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. I also observed an open Michelob Ultra beer can in the center console in arms reach of Rose and his eyes were glossy and bloodshot. I advised him that Id be right back with him. TFC. Yu gave me the males drivers license and I identified him as, Joshua Lee Rose Aiken, H/M, DOB: 11/25/1976 (hereinafter referred to as Rose.) On my second approach, I advised Rose that I could smell the odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle and I wanted to make sure he was okay to drive. I asked him to exit the vehicle to complete a series of field sobriety tests and he complied.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed roadside. The weather was clear and approximately 76 degrees Fahrenheit. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, and my flashlight. The road was level and free from any debris. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Rose was wearing a blue t-shirt, black pants, and Chuck Taylor Converse sneakers. Rose appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any major visible injuries when walking from the vehicle. I asked Rose how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed and he replied, Three beers. As Rose spoke, I again detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, this time emitting from his breath and person.   Rose was asked the following questions:     margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Do you have any medical conditions or injuries- No    margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Are you on any medications  No   margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Do you wear glasses or contacts?

Turn: Did not turn as instructed. Stopped after his last step and looked at me. I reminded him to make the turn and walk back. He turned to the right and stood still.   Walking Stage (2nd Nine):          Missed heel-to-toe by more than half an inch on steps 2, 3, and 4.    Took a total of 13 steps.

Balance and Counting Stage:    Swayed on 1012   margin-left:8px"&gt;Put foot down on 1012 and nearly fell off balance.  Rose did not pick his foot back up and just stood and stared at me.   While on scene, Rose was offered a preliminary breath test with a result of .11.   ARREST   Based on my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and the following, I had reason to believe Rose was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from breath  Eyes glossy and bloodshot.  Admission to consuming alcohol  Clues during field sobriety tests   margin-left:8px"&gt;Positive preliminary testing.    Due to the number of observations, I concluded Rose was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At 2339 hours, I placed Rose under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. A preliminary search of Rose was conducted on scene and there were no foreign objects in his mouth. Rose was placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle per Maryland State Police policy. While in my vehicle, I could still detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. Rose was transported to the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack for processing. During the transport back to the Barrack, Rose did not say anything. The vehicle was locked and secured on the shoulder.  20-Minute Observation Period  A secondary search was conducted upon arrival at the Barrack and revealed that Rose had nothing in his mouth prior to the time he was asked to submit to the test. The DR-15 Advice of Right was played for Rose via the Motor Vehicle Administration audio recording in Spanish. Rose was given a copy to follow along with as it played. During the audio, Rose followed along and read his copy. At 0008 hours on 8/5/2023, Rose agreed to the Intoximeter test. Sgt. Jones #1788 of the Maryland State Police conducted the test and at 0018 hours, the results revealed that Rose had an alcohol concentration of .09 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.   Rose was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and transported to his residence.  Rose was polite and cooperative the entire process.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack DUI J-23-146 J-19 In-Car and Body Camera Operational LICENSE INFO: MD R-225-440-497-901 Joshua Lee Rose Aiken H/M DOB: 11/25/1976 TRAINING / CERTIFICATES:   Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Administration. (June 2020)  Certified RADAR / LIDAR Operator.  Trained in (ARIDE) Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement. (July 2023)   VEHICLE IN MOTION On August 4, 2023, at approximately 2319 hours, I TFC Yu #7292 was stationary on US Route 50 at the 19-mile marker crossover. I observed a tan Toyota Corolla traveling in lane 3 at a high rate of speed. I observed the Toyota utilizing their brakes to slow down while passing me at the crossover then proceed to speed back up. I exit the crossover onto eastbound US Route 50 at the 20-mile marker and observed the Toyota approximately a mile ahead continuing at a high rate of speed. The Toyota was approaching the 21-mile marker (Northbound I-97 exit) with a left turn signal activated. The Toyota switches to lane 2 and then changes lanes back to lane 3 to exit onto eastbound MD-665. I obtained a speed of 94 in a posted 65 utilizing my Golden Eagle II RADAR front antenna in moving mode. I was also traveling 100 mph to decrease the distance between The Toyota and me, I continued following the Toyota onto eastbound MD-665 west of Riva Road and activated my emergency equipment, and initiated a traffic stop.  I observed the tan Toyota Corolla bearing Maryland registration 3DK0264 slow down and come to a complete stop on the right shoulder of eastbound MD-665 at MD-2. PERSONAL CONTACT:  I approached the vehicle from the passengers side and identified myself and the reason for the stop. The driver was identified through his Maryland Drivers License as Joshua Lee Rose Aiken H/M DOB: 11/25/1976. While speaking to Aiken, I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy with the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. Aiken was the sole occupant of the vehicle. I also observed Aiken had an open alcoholic beverage located in the center console. I asked Aiken how many alcoholic beverages he had prior to driving, he advised two beers at his sisters house. I returned to my vehicle and requested another unit for Standardized Field Sobriety.  TFC Lowe #6739 responded to the scene and took over the investigation.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING Refer to TFC Lowe supplement narrative.    All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
