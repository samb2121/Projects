         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-118 R MACK ID: 23-MSP-007163 Defendant: Stephon James Demitri Mack TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 25, 2023 at approximately 0050 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Maryland 43, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a silver Nissan Altima following a vehicle too closely and failing to drive within a single lane. The Nissan was bearing Maryland registration 6EH7855.    Drove on solid yellow fog line with driver side tires.  Drove on solid yellow fog line with driver side tires.  Right over dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Swerving side to side within lane one.  Drove on dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Following a vehicle at approximately one car length. The adjacent lane of Eastern Boulevard was available with no traffic coming.  Right over dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Right over dotted white lane line with passenger side tires, swerved left.  Drove on solid white lane line with driver side tires.  Left over solid white lane line with approximately half the Nissans width.  Drove on dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Upon witnessing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Nissan on Eastern Boulevard at Alcock Road.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Nissan on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the sole occupant. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Georgia drivers license and Maryland identification card as Stephon James Demitri Mack. While speaking with Mack, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with. Upon a METERS/NCIC/MVA browse of Macks license, it revealed his Georgia license is suspended.  I returned to the Nissan and requested Mack to exit his vehicle. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking to Mack outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Mack stated he had one alcoholic mixed beverage (Redbull and Smirnoff Vodka). Additionally, Mack stated his last beer was approximately two hours prior to driving. When asked where he was driving from, Mack stated he was coming from Avenue Tavern. I informed Mack that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed in front of the Nissan on Eastern Boulevard. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a brown jacket, jeans, and shoes.  I asked Mack the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None Physical Injuries  None Medication  None Medical Conditions  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.    Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.      margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.      margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Present in both eyes.      WALK AND TURN (3/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Mack stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Lost his balance, stepped completely offline to the right once.  Walking Stage (1stNine): Nothing observed.  Turn: Did not complete turn as instructed.  Walking Stage (2ndNine):    Stepped completely offline on step 1.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Mack stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  -Left foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:    Placed raised right foot on the ground.  Seconds 11-20:    Nothing observed.  Seconds 21-30:    Swayed body to the left and right.  PBT #70005012 with a result of .11 BrAC.  ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Mack was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0125 hours, I placed Mack under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the Barrack, I provided Mack with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Mack was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. He stated that he understood the form. At 0148 hours, Mack refused to take a breath test.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****REFUSAL*****  Mack was polite and cooperative during the encounter. Mack was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
