         <NarrativeText>In-car camera operational, I-27 incident captured on BWC. Defendant: Christian Aliceanne Simmelink Date of Birth: 12/08/1983 Date of Arrest: October 1, 2023 Time of Arrest: 2042 License#: S-545115048934 DUI #: 23-58-205  CERTIFICATIONS AND TRAINING  * I am a certified Police Officer in the State of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection at the Maryland State Police Academy. The training included classroom instruction, practical application, alcohol workshops, written testing and practical application examination. Prior to starting my employment with the Maryland State Police I was a Patrol Officer with the Cambridge Police Department MD, where I received over 40 hours of training in DUI detection at the Wor-Wic Police Academy. The training included classroom instruction, practical application, alcohol workshops, written testing and practical application examination. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On Sunday October 1, 2023 at approximately 2017, I Trooper Buglio Was on uniformed patrol in a marked Maryland State Police vehicle, I-27, in the area of Route 404 in the area of Holly Road Denton MD. I observed a silver Subaru MD 3AB2640 traveling in lane two with baring expired registration tabs. I observed the vehicle swerving within the lane. I positioned my patrol vehicle behind the Subaru and observed the vehicle was traveling approximately 40mph in a marked 55mph zone. I activated my vehicles emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   While approaching the vehicle I observed all of the windows in the vehicle to be rolled down. I know from my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper to be a tactic used in an attempt to air out the vehicle to prevent the detection of the odor of an alcoholic beverage. As I neared the brake light of the drivers side of the vehicle I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle. I made contact with the driver, and sole occupant of the vehicle, Christian Aliceanne Simmelink W/F DOB 12/08/1983). I identified myself and advised Simmelink of the reason for the traffic stop. While speaking with Simmelink I observed her eyes to be blood shot and glossy. I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Simmelinks breath. I observed the vehicle to still be in drive and I requested Simmelink place the car in park. Based on the observations made while the vehicle in motion as well as the interaction with Simmelink, I informed her that I would be placing her through Standardized Field Sobriety Testing to insure she was safe to continue to drive.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on a sidewalk, in front of Simmelinks vehicle. The surface was level and clear from any debris that would hinder Simmelink during these tests. The weather was clear, calm and partly cloudy. I asked Simmelink if she was on any current medications and her advised Naproxen but only as a as needed basis. I also asked Simmelink if she had any injuries and she advised her left leg, knee, and ankle were all recovering from recent injuries . Glasses/Contacts  None observed.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (2/6 clues observed)   The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus and held approximately 12-15 inches from Simmelinks eyes. Simmelink was instructed to look straight ahead and follow the tip of my pen with her eyes, without moving her heard. Her eyes showed equal tracking, and I observed no resting Nystagmus. Simmelink advised she understood my instructions. Lack of Smooth Pursuit  not present Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation not present Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  present Vertical Gaze Nystagmus observed  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed)   Prior to Simmelink performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. I instructed Simmelink to place her right foot in front of her left foot and stand heel to toe while I provided instructions to the test. She was also instructed to place her arms at her sides and remain in that position. I then explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I informed Simmelink to remain in the instructional position until I told her to begin and she advised she understood. Simmelink was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line, touching heel to toe every step. Simmelink was instructed to keep her hands by her sides, remain focused on her feet, and to count aloud every step. On her ninth step, Simmelink was instructed and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line and take a series of small steps with her rear foot to turn completely around. Simmelink was again instructed to complete the second series of steps identical to the first series. I informed Simmelink to keep her hands by her sides, look down at her feet, count every step aloud, and not stop at any time. I then asked Simmelink if she understood the test and she advised yes. Instructional Stage:  Simmelink was unable to stay in the starting position and had to be repositioned several times. Simmelink raised her arms for balance as well during this stage. Walking Stage (1st Nine) -Stepped offline on step,6,7 - Used arms for balance. Walking Stage (2nd Nine) -Stepped offline on step 1,2,5,7 Turn: Completed unsatisfactorily. Simmelink failed to keep his lead foot planted and take a series of small steps to turn. It should also be noted Simmelink completed 12 steps on the second portion of the walking phase.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4)   Prior to Simmelink performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Simmelink was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, her was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inchers. While her leg was raised, her was to keep her legs straight (slight bend acceptable), watch her raised foot, keep her hands at her sides, to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand two), and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Simmelink if she understood the test and she advised yes. Seconds 0-10: -Used arms for balance. -Sway Seconds 11-20: -put foot down several times Seconds 21-30: -Used arms for balance. Simmelink was offered a preliminary breath test, and refused to take one.  ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Simmelink was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of Alcohol. -Swaying within the lane of travel. -Vehicle traveling approximately 40mph in a marked 55mph zone. -Slow and slurred speech. -blood shot and glossy eyes. -the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Simmelinks breath. -Simmelink advising she consumed several prescribed medications prior to operating her vehicle. -My observed signs (clues) of impairment while she performed the Standard Field Sobriety Tests. I then placed Simmelink under arrest at approximately 2042hours. It should be noted that while retrieving Simmelinks purse from the front passenger seat of the vehicle I located two open Cutwater Lime Margarita 12oz cans. I located one under Simmelinks purse and one in the center console cup holder.  Simmelink was played the DR-15, Advice of Rights audio, and given a copy of the DR-15 once at the Easton Barrack. Simmelink signed the DR-15 form at 2200 hours, and refused to take an inoximeter test.   DISPOSITION OF DEFENDANT   Simmelink was charged with the appropriate traffic citations and was released to a sober driver at approximately 2340 hours. All events occurred in Caroline County Maryland. Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
