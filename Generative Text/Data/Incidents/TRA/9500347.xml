I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 90 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  NARRATIVE  -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION  On September 3, 2023 at approximately 2323 hours, I, TFC Pinto #7212 was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating marked MSP vehicle V-29 the area of Ocean City Expressway on the Isle of Wight Bay Bridge, Berlin, Maryland. At this time, a BOLO (Be On the Look Out) was broadcast over the radio in reference to a possible impaired driver traveling westbound on Ocean City Expressway. A concerned citizen had made telephone contact with the Berlin Barrack and reported the following:  1. The vehicle was a blue Toyota truck bearing New Jersey registration A61LEA. 2. The blue Tacoma was traveling westbound near Ocean Parkway. 3. The blue Tacoma was reported to be traveling 40 MPH in the Posted 55 MPH speed limit.  I located the same vehicle traveling westbound on Ocean City Expressway east of Worcester Highway. I made the following observations on the same vehicle:  BETWEEN RACETRACK ROAD TO NORTHBOUND WORCESTER HWY EXIT  1. The vehicle was traveling below the posted speed limit impeding approximately 15 to 20 vehicles traveling behind it.  ON NORTHBOUND WORCESTER HWY EXIT 2.

Weaving  All of the above DWI indicators were exhibited by the Toyota prior to my initiating a traffic stop on the same vehicle.   TRAFFIC STOP  I activated the emergency lights to my patrol vehicle, initiating a traffic stop on Worcester Highway at Shingle Landing Road. The vehicle was a blue Toyota Tacoma bearing New Jersey registration A61LEA.  -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT-   I made contact with the driver via the driver side door, and I immediately smelled thestrong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I explained the reason for the stop and requested the drivers license and the registration card to the vehicle. The driver was identified as Gary B Gray (W/M 10/30/1961) by his New Jersey drivers license. I asked Gray where he was traveling from, and he responded:My friends house in Dewey Beach. I asked Gray where he was traveling to, and he replied:Im going home. I asked Gray where he lived, and he stated, Pennsville, New Jersey. I asked Gray how long it takes him to get home, and he replied, An hour and a half. I asked Gray how much he had to drink at his friends house, and he advised:About three, no four four four.I asked Gray how long ago he consumed his last alcoholic beverage and he stated, Im gonna say probably in the last three hours.  As Gray spoke, I made the following observations:  1. I intentionally observed his eyes to beglassy and bloodshot. 2. I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the passenger compartment of the vehicle.  I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks on Gray.  I later returned to the Toyota and requested Gray exit the vehicle and walk to the front of it, to which he complied. While Gray stepped from the vehicle I observed the following: 1. After shutting the drivers door he used his right hand on the drivers door to keep his balance.  While at the front of the vehicle, I continued to speak with Gray. I advised Gray that I was going to put him through some test to make sure he can make it home safely, and he responded, I was trying to be safe sir. I advised Gray I was going to ask him some questions and requested he stand with his feet together, hands by his side, and to remain in that position, and he complied.  During my second interaction with Gray, I observed the following: 1. I asked Gray how many alcoholic beverages he consumed before operating the motor vehicle, and he stated, Honestly, maybe four. 2. I asked Gray where he consumed the alcoholic beverages, and he advised a friends house in Bethany Beach, Delaware.  3. I asked Gray what type of alcoholic beverages he consumed, and he responded, They were pretty much just beers. 4.

I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. 6. I continued to observe Grays eyes to be blood shot and glassy.  -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING-  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs)  The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder area. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight, vehicle headlamps, and the street lamps. Weather was clear. I asked Gray if he has any physical disabilities, and he stated,No. I asked Gray if he has any medical disabilities, and he stated,No.I asked Gray if he has any recent injuries, and he replied,I had a work injury about three weeks agoI asked Gray what hurts him, and he responded, My Hip.I asked Gray if his hip is bothering him currently, and he stated, No not right now no.

Gray was wearing a white t-shirt, black blue shorts, and no shoes.  **HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: 6 of 6 clues**  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. A pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from eyes, slightly above eye level. Gray was instructed to look straight ahead at my pen, instructed to follow the pen with his eyes and eyes only, and keep his head and shoulders still. When asked if he understood the instructions, Gray replied,I do.Gray eyes were brown, were equal in size, and showed equal tracking. I observed there was no resting nystagmus.   1. Gray displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  2. Gray displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  3. Gray displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.   **WALK AND TURN: 6 of 8 clues**  Before the test, I asked Gray if he wanted to conduct the test barefoot and he advised he did. I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Gray was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot, touching heel to toe. Gray was instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. I asked Gray if he understood to remain in the starting position, and he stated,I do.Gray was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. Gray was told to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Gray was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Gray was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. I advised Gray I was taking three (3) steps for instructional purposes, but he was to take nine (9) steps. Gray was explained he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping his hands down by his sides, looking down at his feet, and to count every step out loud. When Gray was asked if he understood the test he stated,I do. I asked Gray if he had any questions and he stated, No.  1. Gray could not maintain his balance during the Instruction Phase. Grays feet broke from the start position one (1) occasions, and remained out of the starting position.  2. Gray attempted to start the test before I had completed all instructions.  3. Gray missed heel-to-toe on steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 during the first series. Gray missed heel-to-toe on steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 during the second series. All misses were of more than half an inch.  4. Gray stopped walking at step 9. Gray asked if he turned around and he was advised to turn around how I demonstrated.  5. Gray did not complete the turn in a satisfactory manner, by turning to the right, pivoting on his back foot, and taking a step with his lead foot.  6. Gray was unable to maintain a straight line and stepped off the line on step 6 during the first series.   **ONE LEG STAND: 2 of 4 clues**  Prior to Gray performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch his foot, keep his toe pointed forward, keep his hands at his sides, to count out loud by thousands (one-one thousand, two- one thousand, three- one thousand), and to continue the test until told to stop. When Gray was asked if he understood the instructions he replied,I do.When told to begin Gray lifted his right leg.  1. Grays body swayed to the left and right between seconds: 1-10 seconds.  3. Gray put his left foot down between seconds: 1-10 seconds, 11-20 seconds, and 21-30 seconds.   ADDITIONAL TESTING  **ALPHABET TEST**:  Gray advised that he was capable of reciting the English alphabet and graduated from high school. I instructed Gray to recite from the letter F to the letter T.  -Gray recited: G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P.  **COUNT TEST**:  Gray advised he was capable of counting backwards. I instructed Gray to count backwards from 59-36.  -Gray counted from59-58-57-56-58-59, Gray stated, Oh wait, sorry Im going back. Im start again, Im going forward and backwards. Gray then counted, 59-58-57-56-55-54-55-54-53-52-53-52-51-51-0-49-48-47-46-47-48-49-49-47-48.    PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT)  After the conclusion of all Field Sobriety Tests, I offered Gray the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). Gray refused.   ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Gray was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  * Driving vehicle in a negligent manner which caused it to commit 4 lane violations in addition to impeding the normal flow of traffic DRIVING SKILLS IMPAIRED. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Admission to consuming at least one (4) alcoholic beverage prior to operating a motor vehicle. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.  I determined that Gray was under the influence of alcohol that adversely affected his ability to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. The inability to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests properly can also adversely affect the persons ability to operate a motor vehicle safely. I placed Gray under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0012 hours on September 4, 2023.  TRANSPORT  Gray was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. Gray was transported to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for processing. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Gray continued to be strong. Upon arrival at the barrack, Gray advised that he needed to use the restroom. Gray was given the opportunity to use the restroom in cell #2 while supervised.  ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)  Gray was given his Advice of Rights via the audio version of the DR-15 Form (played through speakers of a computer). A copy of the DR-15 Form was given to Gray, and he was asked to follow along. At the conclusion of the audio version, Gray was asked if he wanted to submit to the intoximeter test, and he agreed to submit to a breath test at approximately 0123 hours on September 4, 2023.  **INTOXIMETER RESULT**:  Prior to the breath test, I observed Sergeant Bowie visually check the inside of Grays mouth for any foreign objects. None were found.  The breath test was administered by SGT Bowie at approximately 0132 hours on September 4, 2023, and two (2) sufficient samples of Grays breath were obtained. The breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of0.17grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  RELEASE  Garcia was released and advised not to drive for 12 hours.  CHARGES  Garcia was charged with the following citations:    Driving Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol (3TV0VPH)  Driving Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol Per Se (3TW0VPH)  Driving Vehicle While Impaired by Alcohol (3TX0VPH)  Negligent Driving (3TY0VPH)  Reckless Driving (3TZ0VPH)  Driver Failure to Obey Properly Placed Traffic Control Device Instructions (3V00VPH)  Failure to Equip.
