         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police North East Barrack F MSP marked vehicle F-10 is equipped with a mobile recording device. I, TFC Yocum #6934 am equipped with a body worn camera. The Traffic stop was recorded.  DEFENDANT: PILKINGTON, FRANK JAMES JR  Date of Birth: 05/20/1989 Date of Arrest: 02/12/2023 Time of Arrest: 2341 hours (11:41 PM) DUI #: 23-038 (North East Barrack)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). * I am trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driver Enforcement (ARIDE). * I have apprehended more than 150 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1): On February 12, 2023, at approximately 2307 hours, I, Trooper First Class Yocum #6934 was on duty and in full uniform, operating Maryland State Police unmarked police cruiser F-10. At this time, I was dispatched to a two-motor vehicle collision located at the intersection of North East Road and Doctor Miller Road. Upon my arrival, I located the at-fault vehicle, a 2020 gray Chevrolet Equinox displaying Pennsylvania registration KFL1103. I observed extensive damage to the front of the Equinox. Upon observing the damage to the non-at-fault vehicle (International Tractor Trailer), and through investigations, I was able to determine that the Equinox was attempting to make a left turn onto southbound North East Road from Doctor Miller Road, failed to yield, and struck the tractor trailer.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2): I contacted the driver/sole occupant of the Equinox, who would be identified by his Pennsylvania drivers license as Frank James Pilkington, JR. (DOB: 05/20/1989 2/M). I contacted Pilkington to check on his welfare, Pilkington was sitting in the front driver-seat of the Equinox, and he advised to EMS that he was okay. Pilkington then faced me and stated, I have nystagmus in my eyes, but regardless, Im drunk-driving. While speaking with Pilkington, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. Also, while speaking with Pilkington, his voice was slurred, and his eyes were glassy, watery, and bloodshot.   I asked Pilkington what happened to which he advised, to which he stated, Im going to get blamed regardless because its drunk-driving, but it is what it is. I asked Pilkington how much he had to drink, to which he advised a couple beers and a couple shots. At this time, I went to check on the condition of the other driver.  Upon re-initiating contact with Pilkington, I had him walk to the front of my patrol cruiser. I requested Pilkington to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3): The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of northbound North East Road. The surface was solid, flat, and free from any debris. The weather condition at the time was no precipitation and approximately 35 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicles headlights and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Pilkington appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. I asked Pilkington the following questions:  I asked Pilkington when he consumed his last beverage, to which he stated, probably hour ago, half hour ago, sir.  I asked Pilkington what alcoholic beverages he was consuming, to which he stated, Crown Royal.  Medication  None. Physical injuries/ disabilities  None. Glasses/ Contacts  Contacts.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) I gave instructions on how the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was to be performed. I asked Pilkington if he understood all instructions and demonstrations, to which he stated, Yes.  ** Pilkington advised me multiple times that he has natural nystagmus. **  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes.  *** Vertical nystagmus was present in both eyes.***  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) I gave instructions and fully demonstrated how the Walk and Turn test was to be performed. I asked Pilkington if he understood all instructions and demonstrations, to which he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Cannot keep balance.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):  1.) Missed heel to toe. 2.) Steps off line. 3.) Raised arms for balance. 4.) Incorrect number of steps (10)  Turn: Completed unsatisfactory Did not keep lead foot planted.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  1.) Missed heel to toe. 2.) Steps off line. 3.) Raised arms for balance.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) I gave instructions and fully demonstrated how the One Leg Stand test was to be performed. I asked Pilkington if he understood all instructions and demonstrations, to which he stated, Yes.  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Raised arms for balance. 2.) Swayed back and forth. 3.) Put foot down.  At approximately 10 seconds into the test, Pilkington advised that he couldnt do it.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Pilkington was driving under the influence:  - Vehicle in motion. - Watery, glassy and bloodshot eyes. - Slurred speech. - Driver stated multiple times he was Drunk-driving. - Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating off of his breath and person. - Driver admitted to consuming alcoholic beverage prior to driving (Beers and Crown Royal-approximately 30 minutes from time of collision). - Clues observed during standardized field sobriety testing.  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Pilkington was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2341 hours (11:41 PM), I placed Pilkington under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence. Pilkington was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to Maryland State Police North East Barrack for processing.  Pilkington was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights in English. Pilkington was also provided a copy to view. On 2/13/2023 at approximately 0008 hours (12:08 AM), Pilkington elected to submit to the breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: Pilkington was observing during the entire observation period, and nothing was placed in or near his mouth.  INTOXIMETER RESULTS: Pilkington took a test of breath on 2/13/2023 at approximately 0016 hours (12:16 AM) and his results were: .17 BrAC.  All appropriate citations were issued to Pilkington and he was provided copies of all pertinent paperwork. Pilkington was advised he could not operate a motor vehicle for 12 hours. Pilkington was released to a sober driver.  Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
