         <NarrativeText>**Repeat Offender** DUI Case #23-003 Stop was recorded by my state issued body camera. Title on Evidence.com23-MSP-000450.  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2016. * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impairment Detection, June 2017  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion On January 4, 2023, at approximately 1553 hours, I, TFC Skrodinsky was dispatched to disabled vehicle on Mountain Road and Old Mountain Road Central.I arrived on scene and observed white truck tractor displaying Tennessee registration P687HY that had run off the road to the right and became disabled partially on the northbound side of Mountain Road.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact I contacted the driver and identified him through his Maryland drivers license as Derek Andre Clary (DOB: 01/09/1961, 1/M). I asked Clary what happened and he advised, the vehicle in front of him stopped and he swerved to avoid striking that vehicle. He continued to say, the other vehicle initially stopped, but then left the scene. I asked Clary where he was coming from and he advised it was day off, but his company contacted him and asked him to pick up the truck. While conversing with Clary, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person momentarily. Also, I noticed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Clarys speech was slow and slurred, and he repeated himself multiple times. Clary was acting in an unusual manner. I asked Clary if he had any medical conditions and he advised he has diabetes. Due to his unstable behavior, I requested medical to evaluate Clary. EMS responded and evaluated Clary. They advised his blood sugar was good and he appeared to be in good health. Clary refused to be transported to the hospital. I asked Clary if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages and he advised he did not. While standing directly in front of Clary, I was able to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage again. Based on the above observations, I asked Clary to perform standardized field sobriety tests, which he agreed.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening The evaluation was performed on the side of Mountain Road. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of the natural sunlight and my flashlight. My vehicles front emergency lights were deactivated during all Field Sobriety Testing.    Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12-15 inches from Clarys eyes, slightly above his eye level. Clary was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. I held the stimulus in front of Clarys eyes in order to check for resting nystagmus, which was not present.   Lack of smooth pursuit  Both eyes Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation  Both eyes Onset nystagmus prior to 45 degrees  Both eyes  Walk and Turn  7 of 8 Clues Prior to Clary performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Clary if he understood the test and he advised he did.  Instructional Stage:   Balance  Clary stepped out of the instructional stance multiple times.  Started too soon  Clary started test before being instructed to do so.   Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Missed Heel to Toe  Every Step  Stepped off line  Steps 2, 4, and 10  Number of Steps - 15  Turn:    Completed turn unsuccessful  Clary pivoted on his toes and stumbled prior to beginning the second series of 9 steps  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Missed Heel to Toe  Every Step  Number of Steps  12  Raised Arms for Balance  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12   One Leg Stand  4of 4 Clues Prior to Clary performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Clary if he understood the test and he advised he did. Instruction Stage:    Nothing to Report  Balance Stage: 0-10 Seconds:    Put foot down  Raised Arms  Swayed from side to side  11-20 Seconds:    Put foot down  Hopped  21-30 Seconds:    Put foot down  Hopped   PBT .21  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Clary was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 1653 hours, I placed Clary under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Clary was handcuffed with his hands behind his back, so that he may not place anything in his mouth. I transported Clary to the Bel Air Barrack for processing. While in route to the barrack, I played the audio for the DR-15 from the MVAs website. At the conclusion of the audio, Clary agreed to submit to the intoximeter.   20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD I conducted the 20-minute observation period of Clary which began with his arrest. I observed Clary from this time until he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The intoximeter test was administered by Cpl. Workman, a certified intoximeter operator of the Maryland State Police, on a certified instrument (S/N: 011759).  INTOXIMETER RESULT ****.22BRAC**** Clary had a result of .22 BRAC at 1734hours. He was given all copies of pertinent paperwork to include DUI citations and was released from the Bel Air Barrack.  Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
