         <NarrativeText>Attachments: Emails from complainant  Suspect: Unknown  Victim: Kevin Koami Nomenyo Date of Birth: 9/8/2001 240-491-1025 Statement:   The time was 8:06PM approximately and I am a security guard hired to maintain order on the premise. I asked a gentleman, we will call him gentleman, to please wrap up what he was doing and to gather his things and leave as soon as possible. The gentleman responded sarcastically and showed a look of disgust and annoyance on his face at my telling him to leave.   He yelled at me, berated me and pushed me backwards in which I slightly fell onto a small child which was captured on a surveillance camera. The camera only captures gentlemen pushing my hand and stomach away from him but Im not sure if it captured how I fell onto the child. I then told the gentleman what he just did when he put his hands on me and he showed indifference and told me to leave in an aggressive manner.   I left to go tell the managers and they came out to go speak with him. While we left the office in the back to go back to the front to speak to the gentleman, he came back to give me a piece of his mind in which he assaulted me and did the same thing. He fainted aggressively at me and made it seem as though he was going to physically harm me and made me feel as such as well. He continuously cursed me out and belittled me and was finally deescalated to leave in which he did without further incident.   I spoke to my security boss and the manager on scene about what happened and told them that I intend to press charges. Then I called 911 and you were the officer assigned to the scene.  Narrative:   On February 5, 2023, at approximately 2030 hours, I, TFC. Silver #6756, was on duty when I was advised to make contact with a security guard at Urban Air, located 5830 Ballenger Creek Pike, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland 21703 for a reported assault that took place. I made contact with Kevin Koami Nomenyo by telephone. Kevin stated he was working as a security guard at Urban Air when he told an unknown male that they were closing and that he needed to gather his belongings to exit the building. The male then became visibly upset with him and pushed his hand with an open hand. Kevins arm swung back and made contact with a small child. The child was apparently uninjured according to Kevin. Kevin stated he did not have any visible injuries. Kevin stated the assault was captured by video surveillance. During this time, Urban Air had closed due to normal business hours. I was en route to Urban Air when Kevin advised that he was just going to leave due to my estimated time of arrival to Urban Air. I advised Kevin that I would obtain the video surveillance footage on a later date.   On February 13, 2023 I received an email from Kevin stating that he does not want to proceed with charges on the unknown male and that he was no longer employed by Urban Air.   All of these events did occur in Frederick County, Maryland.   I request this case to be closed due to lack of prosecution. </NarrativeText>
