         <NarrativeText>MSP marked vehicle N-16 is equipped with a mobile recording device      Defendant: Porfirio Murillo Ramirez      Date of Birth: 09/15/1972      Date of Arrest: 01/27/2023      Times of Arrest: 2221 Hours      DUI #: 23-025 (Rockville Barrack)      Case #: 23-MSP-003468       CERTIFICATION  TRAINING    * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * Trained and certified to operate radar and lidar through the Maryland State Police.  * Preliminary breath test operator certified.  * Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement training certified.  * Traffic Safety Specialist Designation I    VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)    On 01/27/2023 at approximately 2151 hours, I, TFC Yu #6690 was operating MSP marked vehicle N-16 and responded to a two vehicle collision on N/B Rt 270 S/O Rt 189 local lane, Montgomery County, Maryland. Upon my arrival, I observed a black Honda Civic bearing Maryland registration 8CF3669 sustained front damage, drivers airbag and right side airbag deployed. I observed a black Mercedes Benz bearing Maryland registration 9DX5697 sustained rear damage. Both vehicles were parked on the right shoulder. I observed a hispanic male standing next to the black Honda Civic. I observed a white female standing by the passenger side of the Mercedes who was identified by her CA drivers license as Sara Seyedghasemipour. I observed another white female in the drivers seat of the Mercedes who appeared to be in pain. The Mercedes driver was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Labkhand Sami. Seyedghasemipour advised they were just driving and the Honda rear ended them and then the Honda struck a wall. Sami was transported to Suburban Hospital.    PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)    I made contact with the driver of the Honda Civic, the Hispanic male, and I immediately smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his body and breath. The Hispanic male was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Porfirio Murillo Ramirez. I asked Murillo Ramirez if he was driving the Honda Civic, Murillo Ramirez said yeah. Murillo Ramirez advised he came from Clydes, the restaurant. I asked Murillo Ramirez what happened, Murillo Ramirez saide I dont know. I asked Murillo Ramirez how much he drank, Murillo Ramirez said nothing. I asked Murillo Ramirez again how much he drank, Murillo Ramirez changed his answer to 2 12 oz Modelo beers. I intentionally noticed Murillo Ramirez eyes to be watery, glassy, and bloodshot. I observed Murillo Ramirez body movements to be slow. Due to the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Murillo Ramirez breath, glassy, watery, very bloodshot eyes, admission of 2 12 oz Modelo beers, slow body movements, changing his answer about alcohol consumption, causing a collision, memory loss, I decided to offer Murillo Ramirez Standard Field Sobriety test. I informed Murillo Ramirez that I would be performing field sobriety tests on him and to which he agreed.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)    The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of N/B Rt 270 S/O Rt 189 local lane. The surface was wet and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 35 degrees Fahrenheit. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight, my patrol vehicle N-16s headlights and street lamps. All patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Murillo Ramirez appeared to be in good physical condition. Murillo Ramirez was facing the same direction of traffic.    I asked Murillo Ramirez the following questions:    Medical Conditions  No.  Injuries  No.  Medication- no.  Glasses/Lenses no    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)    The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Murillo Ramirez eyes. Murillo Ramirez was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Murillo Ramirez pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I asked Murillo Ramirez if he understood the directions and he said yes.    1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes.  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  no    I had to instruct Murillo Ramirez not to move his head again.    WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed)    Prior to Murillo Ramirez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Murillo Ramirez was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Murillo Ramirez was instructed to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to move. Murillo Ramirez was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Murillo Ramirez was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Murillo Ramirez was demonstrated and explained to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around to the left. Murillo Ramirez was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Murillo Ramirez was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Murillo Ramirez if he completely understood the instructions and he said yes (Footwear: tan camo Crocs)    Instructional Stage:      Lost balance during the entire stage (feet broke apart more than 3 inches).     Began test before instructed- no    Walking Stage (1st Nine)  Stops walking - No      Missed heel to toe by more than an  inches - 1-11.     Stepped off the line by more than 2 inches - no.

Murillo Ramirez was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. Murillo Ramirez was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, one thousand-three) and to continue the test until told to stop. Murillo Ramirez was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he said yes (Footwear: tan camo Crocs)    Instructional Stage:  N/A    Murillo Ramirez raised his right foot.

The Preliminary Breath Test was not offered to Murillo Ramirez on scene.      ARREST    Based on my knowledge, experience, and training, I placed Murillo Ramirez as under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at 2221 hours.    * Admission of driving  * Admission of driving from a bar (Clydes)  * Causing a collision.  * Not remembering what happened with the collision.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from breath.  * Eyes were very bloodshot, glassy and watery.  * Slow body movements.  * Admission to consuming 2 12 oz Modelo beers.  * Changing his answer about alcohol consumption.  * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.    Murillo Ramirez was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to Rockville Barrack N for processing. At approximately 2229 hours, we arrived at the Rockville Barrack. I gave Murillo Ramirez a copy of the DR-15 The Advice of Rights form to follow along as I played the MVA audio Spanish version of the DR-15 the Advice of Rights in its entirety. After I played the audio version of the form to Murillo Ramirez at approximately 2250 hours, Murillo Ramirez agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 form.    20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD    I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Murillo Ramirez before the SFST on the highway. A preliminary search of Murillo Ramirez was conducted on scene and it revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Murillo Ramirez was observed from the time of SFST until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything else in his mouth. Also, no facial/oral piercings were observed.    INTOXIMETER RESULT:    The test was administered by Cpl Thomas #4714 of Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Murillo Ramirez gave a breath sample of .16 BRAC at 2257 hours.
