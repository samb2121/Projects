         <NarrativeText>MD Soundex: S530454067293  DUI #: 23-96-151 Subsequent offender: No MSP unmarked unit V-24 isequipped with a camera system. This incident was recorded on my agency issued body worn camera.  Narrative:  On 06/04/2023 at approximately 0233 hours, I was operating MSP unmarked patrol vehicle, V-24, in the area of westbound MD RT 90 near Coastal Hwy Ocean City, MD 21842.   Phase One - Vehicle in Motion:  On the date of this incident, the weather was clearand cool, and traffic was light. While on patrol, I observed a gray minivan traveling directly in front of me that was swerving within its own lane. Prior to activating my in car camera, I observed the gray minivan cross the solid white shoulder line three times while traveling over the Assawoman Bay Bridge. While continuing to follow the vehicle westbound, I observed it cross the solid white shoulder line again in the area of Ocean Parkway. While continuing westbound, the vehicle crossed the solid white should line three more times. After making all of these observations, I conducted a traffic stop on the Dodge minivan bearing MD registration 8EC6773 on the ramp from westbound MD RT 90 to northbound MD RT 589.  Phase Two - Personal Contact:    I made contact with the operator at the drivers side window, introduced myself, and asked to see her drivers license and registration. The operator had a thousand yard stare when she looked at me and seemed to be moving slowly. I asked the operator if she had consumed any alcoholic beverages or taken any illegal substances which she denied. The operator appeared to have watery and glassy eyes. Due to my observations, I called for a second unit to my location. I was able to positively identify the operator as Julie Anne Smith by her Maryland drivers license.  Phase Three - Pre-Arrest Screening:   After a second Trooper arrived at scene, I approachedSmithagain, asked her to exit her vehicle, and escorted her to the front of her vehicle. I again askedSmith if she had anything to drink, and she just stated that she was at the rodeo, and it was her first time.   I asked Smith if she wore glasses or contacts, and she stated no. I asked her if she had any injuries that prevented her from walking, turning, or standing, and she stated no. I then askedSmithif she took any medications or illegal substances which she denied.The roadway was flat and free of debris.  The first test administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test:    Iexplained and demonstrated the test to Smith. Smithadvised she understood the instructions and did not have any questions. Prior to beginning the test, I held my pen twelve (12) to fifteen (15) inches from Smithsnose, slightly above eye level. I could again see thatSmith had glassy and watery eyes. During the test, Smithdisplayed equal pupil size and equal tracking. Smith displayed lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. A check for Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was conducted with negative results. After observing these clues, I askedSmith what alcoholic beverages she had consumed during the evening.Smith stated that she had consumed three beers throughout the day.  A total of six (6) clues were observed during this test.  The second test administered was the Walk and Turn Test:    Iexplained and demonstrated the test to Smith. After explaining and demonstrating the test, Smith advised she understood my instructions and did not have any questions.  During the first series of nine heel to toe stepsSmith raised her arms greater than six inches from her body and only took eight steps.Smithdid not complete the turn as instructed.Smithdid not keep her lead foot planted. During the second series of nine heel to toe steps,Smith immediately stopped walking to ask me a question.Smiththen missed stepping heel to toe and stepped off-line on step two.Smithalso raised her arms greater than six inches from her body on steps five through seven.  A total of six (6) clues were observed during this test.  The third test administered was the One Leg Stand Test:    Iexplained and demonstrated the test to Smith. Upon completion of my explanation and demonstration, Smith advised she didunderstand the instructions and had no questions.Approximately 16 seconds into the test,Smith swayed from side to side but was able to maintain her balance.  One (1) clue was observed during this test.  Upon completion of the tests, I offered Smith to submit to a Preliminary Breath Test, which she agreed. The results of this test were .13 BraC.  Based on my training at the Maryland State Police Academy, training, knowledge, experience and prior DUI arrests, I placed Smith under arrest for Driving under the Influence of Alcohol at approximately 0244 hours. Smithsoral cavity was checked upon arrest and was free of any foreign objects.  While on scene, I played an MVA audio recording to Smith of her DR-15 Advice of Rights at approximately 0247 hours. Smith agreed to submit to the Intoximeter Test.Smiths breath specimen was collected at 0336 hours on 06/04/2023 and was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. The Intoximeter test was conducted by Cpl. Lenz #4839.   I transported Smith to the MSP Berlin Barrack for further processing.  Smithwas released with the following citations:  1. 21-902(a1ii): Driving vehicle under the influence of alcohol per se  2. 21-902 (a)(1): Driving Vehicle under the Influence of Alcohol  3. 21-902 (b)(1): Driving While Impaired by Alcohol  4. 21-901.1(a): Reckless driving vehicle in wanton and willful disregard for safety of persons and property  5. 21-901.1 (b): Negligent Driving in Careless and Imprudent Manner Endangering   Property, Life, and Person  6. 21-309 (d): Driver failure to obey designated lane directions  I request this case beclosed by arrest.
