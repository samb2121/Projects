         <NarrativeText>DUI Case#23-101 A-13 In-Car and BWC was operational Intoximeter Results: .14 BrAC TRAINING: STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETYCERTIFIED ADVANCED ROADSIDE IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT CERTIFIED DEFENDANT: Chineye Ugonna Emeche, DOB: 05/24/1985, black female 14420 Mayfair Dr Laurel, MD 20707 Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion On Monday, October 2, 2023, at approximately 0026 hours, I, Trooper Amoh #7037 of the Maryland State Police Waterloo Barrack was parked at the crossover on Southbound I-95 prior to the rest area in Laurel, Howard County, Maryland conducting a stationary Laser speed enforcement. I am a trained and certified Laser operator and the Laser was tested before and after the traffic stop and was functional. I observed a vehicle traveling in lane 3 at a high rate of speed. I pointed the laser at the vehicle and observed it to be traveling 109 mph in a 65-mph zone. I got back in the lane of travel after the vehicle had driven past my marked patrol vehicle. The vehicle continued to travel at a high rate activated my emergency lights and siren and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle was a black BMW X3 with a Maryland registration plate number, 6EL7746.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact I contacted the operator by the passenger side door. The driver immediately lowered the window and handed over her drivers license and vehicle registration to me. I introduced myself to the driver and advised her of the reason for the stop. I asked the driver if there was a reason for traveling at that rate of speed, but she stated there was no reason. The driver was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Chineye Ugonna Emeche, an African American female, DOB: 05/24/1985. While talking to Emeche, I could smell the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and inside the vehicle. I asked Emeche how many alcoholic beverages she had drank, and she stated she had brunch at approximately 1300 hours and then went to watch the Philadelphia Eagles game during which time she had three drinks. I requested for an additional unit to respond to my location and TFC Cirino #6936 responded to my location.   Based on the above observations, I asked Emeche to exit her vehicle to complete standardized field sobriety tests, in which she agreed. While talking to Emeche in front of her vehicle, I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. I also observed her eyes to be glassy and bloodshot. I again asked Emeche how much alcoholic beverage she had drank, and she again stated 3 drinks at approximately 1300 to 1600 hours. I asked Emeche the type of alcoholic beverage she drank, and she stated it was Whisky.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening I asked Emeche the following questions. Medications  No Glasses - No Injuries  No    I am trained through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in administrating Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. The test was performed on a smooth surface free of any debris.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus -6 of 6 clues Emeche turned around so that herback was facing away from oncoming traffic. My black ballpoint pen used as the test stimulus, was held approximately 12 inches from Emeche eyes. I instructed Emeche to look straight ahead, keeping herhead still while following and focusing on the stimulus with her eyes until told to stop. Emeches pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Iasked Emeche if she understood the instructions, and she stated yes. - Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus Prior to Reaching 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes. Walk and Turn 2 of 8 clues Prior to Emeche performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I instructed Emeche to place her left foot on an imaginary line and to put her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. I instructed Emeche to place her hands by her side and to remain in that position until told to begin. I advised Emeche to take nine (9) steps on an imaginary straight line touching heel to toe on every step. She was to keep her hands down at her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Emeche was demonstrated and explained to keep her lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around. I again explained and demonstrated the second series of steps to be performed identical to the first series. I advised Emeche that once she started the test, she was not to stop until the test was completely finished. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Emeche if she completely understood the instructions and she said yes, she understood. INSTRUCTIONAL POSITION - I did not observe any clue.  WALKING STAGE First 9 Steps -Emeche just turned around without using a small series of steps as instructed.   Second 9 Steps -Emeche missed heel-toe on step 4 of the second 9 steps. One Leg Stand 1of 4 clues  Prior to Emeche performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Emeche was instructed to stand with her feet together and her hands by her sides while the instructions were given and during the test. Emeche was instructed not to begin the test until she was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately six (6) inches. While her leg was raised, shewas to keep her leg straight, keep her toe pointed forward, watch her raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand one, one thousand two, onethousand three...) and to continue the test until told to stop. Emeche was asked if she understood the test and the instructions given, and she answered yes. BALANCE AND COUNTING STAGE Seconds 0-30 - Emeche put her foot down two times before the 30 seconds was up. Based on the above observations, I believed Emeche was unable to operate a vehicle safely. Emeche asked whether she passed or failed the test. I advised her, the test was or not a pass of fail test and the decision is based on my observations. Emeche kept saying she was not drunk, and she was just trying to get home so that she could attend her 0900 hours meeting. Emeche stated she was sorry for speeding as she kept saying she was not intoxicated. Emeche stated she is willing to do any other test, so she was offered a Preliminary Breath Test which she refused. Emeche stated she knew and worked with lawyers, so she knows not to take that test. Emeche kept asking whether she failed or passed the SFSTs and I kept explaining to her, it was based on my observations. I explained to Emeche based on my observations, she was not safe to drink. Emeche stated she would get an uber home or have her sister drive her home since she was only fifteen miles away. I advised Emeche to turn around and place her hands behind her back, and she asked why she was being place under arrest and I explained to her for driving under the influence of alcohol. Emeche argued and advised she was not under any influence of alcohol. Emeche was eventually placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0148 hours. I placed Emeche in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. I requested for a female officer to respond to the Waterloo Barracks for a search on Emeche. I transported Emeche to the Waterloo Barracks and arrived at approximately 0202 hours, where Officer Chiusano #6359 of the Howard County Police Department responded to the barracks and conducted the secondary search. At that time, chewing gum was found in Emeches mouth. She was instructed to spit the gum out in a trash can, at which time the 2o minutes observation period was started. I provided Emeche a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to read along as I read the form in its entirety for her. Emeche stated she understood the form and agreed to submit to the Alcohol Concentration Test at 0220hours. The Alcohol Concentration test was administered by Sgt. Gailor #1086 at 0238 hours and the breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters per breath. I issued Emeche the appropriate citations and paperwork, and she was later released to her sister, Nkeiruka Sylvia Emeche at the barracks without incident.  Case closed: Non-criminal. All events occurred in Howard County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
