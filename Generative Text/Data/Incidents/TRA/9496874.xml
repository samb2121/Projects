         <NarrativeText>Vehicle Number: V-18s camera was operational, Axon body camera captured the incident as well Narrative   On 03/28/2023 at approximately 1941 hours, I responded to a report of a disorderly subject at the Ocean Downs Casino located at 10218 RACETRACK RD, BERLIN, MD 21811. I arrived on scene at approximately 1946 hours.  Upon my arrival to the Ocean Downs Casino I made contact with security supervisor Mark Anderson. The security supervisor stated a patron, Lance Shawn Schreffler was being disorderly, creating a scene to other patrons, and as security staff told him to stop his behavior he gave security staff the middle finger. The security supervisor stated they asked Schreffler to leave the property multiple times due to his behavior and Schreffler refused. The security supervisor informed Schreffler that law enforcement would be called if he did not leave. The security supervisor stated Schreffler said he did not care that law enforcement was being called and to just call them. The security supervisor stated Schreffler was in the bathroom and continued to refuse to leave.  A Worcester County Sheriffs Deputy arrived on scene to assist. I waited along with the deputy outside the bathroom for approximately 5 minutes. Schreffler did not come out of the bathroom. The security supervisor walked into the bathroom with me and identified Schreffler as the disorderly subject and stated he would like to have Schreffler trespassed from the premises. I asked Schreffler to step outside the bathroom, as he was at the urinal. Schreffler stated he would, so I walked outside the bathroom. I stayed outside the bathroom for a few minutes waiting for Schreffler and walked back in. Schreffler was still standing at the urinal, so I again asked Schreffler to walk out of the bathroom. Schreffler complied and followed me outside into the parking lot of the casino. Scheffler appeared to be intoxicated due to his glassy eyes, slurred speech, and lethargic movements. I informed Schreffler that he was not in any trouble with law enforcement, however, management of the casino wanted him trespassed from the property. I asked Schreffler if he had an ID and Schreffler stated he did not have one on him. I asked Schreffler for his name and date of birth to identify him. Schreffler stated fuck you and refused to give it to me. I asked Schreffler multiple times to identify himself with me, and he refused every time. I informed Schreffler if he did not identify himself he would be placed under arrest. Schreffler continued to refuse, so I informed Schreffler he was being placed under arrest and placed him in handcuffs. Schreffler became verbally combative cursing towards officers and continued to refuse to identify himself. Schreffler continued to talk about the amount of money he made and called me a piece of shit and faggot multiple times. I searched Schreffler incident to arrest, a Pennsylvania drivers license was found in the casino and the security supervisor brought it out to troopers outside. I identified Schreffler by matching his physical description with this ID.  I placed Schreffler in my vehicle and drove him to the Berlin barrack for processing. Schreffler continued to be verbally combative with troopers. While writing this probable cause statement he continued to pester troopers by rattling the chain that he was handcuffed to in the troopers room and calling troopers faggots and pussies among other obscenities. Schreffler was asked multiple times if he had a ride that could come pick him up at the barrack to which he responded with fuck you and he wasnt going to be arrested.   Schreffler was placed in front of an Ocean City Court Commissioner and was released on his own recognizance.   I request this case be closed per on-view arrest.  All events occurred in Worcester County, MD. </NarrativeText>
