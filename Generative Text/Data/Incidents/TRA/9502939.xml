         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-137 R CASASOLA MORALES ID: 23-MSP-008752 Defendant: Selvin Eliezer Casasola Morales TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On March 9, 2023 at approximately 2240 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Carroll Island Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a tan Ford truck failing to drive within a single lane and traveling above the posted speed limit. The Ford was bearing Maryland registration 2Z6373.    73-MPH in a 40-MPH speed zone.  Left over double solid yellow lane line with driver side tires.  Left over double solid yellow lane line with driver side tires.  Left over double solid yellow lane line with driver side tires.  Drove on double solid yellow lane line with driver side tires.  The Ford accelerated away from my patrol vehicle at what appeared to be above the posted 40 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar, which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 73 MPH in a posted 40 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). Upon observing the Fords speed and entering the oncoming traffic lane on several occasions, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Ford on Eastern Avenue at Ebenezer Road.  The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Ford on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the sole occupant. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. The driver advised he does not have a drivers license and provided me with his Guatemala identification card. He was identified by his Guatemala identification card as Selvin Eliezer Casasola Morales. While speaking with Casasola Morales, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with. Additionally, I requested a Spanish speaking officer to respond to the scene of the traffic stop. A METERS/NCIC/MVA browse confirmed Casasola Morales does not have a license.  I returned to the Ford and requested Casasola Morales to exit his vehicle. I utilized a Google Translate Application to communicate with Casasola Morales until the Spanish speaking officer arrived. He complied and exited his vehicle. Casasola Morales advised he understood what was being translated for him through the Application. While speaking to Casasola Morales outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Casasola Morales stated he had five or six beers (Corona). Additionally, Casasola Morales stated his last Corona beer was approximately twenty minutes prior to driving. I informed Casasola Morales that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed in a parking lot off of Eastern Avenue. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a jacket, jeans, and boots.  I asked Casasola Morales the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None Physical Injuries  None Medication  None Medical Conditions  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.    Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.     Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.     Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) Trooper First Class Lora (7207) arrived on scene and translated the remaining tests for Casasola Morales. The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Casasola Morales stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Began the test too soon.  Walking Stage (1stNine):    Stepped completely offline on steps 1, 5, and 7.  Turn:    Did not complete the turn as instructed.  Walking Stage (2ndNine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on step 1.  Stepped completely offline on step 3.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Casasola Morales stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  -Left foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:    Placed raised left foot on the ground.  Seconds 11-20:    Placed raised left foot on the ground.  Swayed body to the left and right.  Seconds 21-30:    Placed raised left foot on the ground.  PBT #70005012 with a result of .16 BrAC.  ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Casasola Morales was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2318 hours, I placed Casasola Morales under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the Barrack, I provided Casasola Morales with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Casasola Morales was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights in Spanish from the MVA website. He stated that he understood the form. At 0017 hours (3/10/2023), Casasola Morales agreed to take a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Casasola Morales beginning at 2356 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Casasola Morales was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by TFC. Jackson of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Casasola Morales had a result of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0037 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****.14 grams of alcohol*****  Casasola Morales was polite and cooperative during the encounter. Casasola Morales was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and transported to his residence.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
