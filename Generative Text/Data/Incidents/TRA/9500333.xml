         <NarrativeText> This traffic stop was captured on the L-28 In-Car Camera and BWC #6582  Defendant: Creek, Khalil Rashid  Date of Birth: 10/26/1998  Date of Arrest: 05/27/2023  Time of Arrest: 0038  DUI #: 23-163 (Forestville Barrack)  BAC: Refused    CERTIFICATION  TRAINING    -NHSTA Trained/certified to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST)  -Preliminary breath test operator certified  -Certified Radar/Laser Operator  -Washington Regional Alcohol Program 2017 awardee  -Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) Trained.  - Apprehended more than 150 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police.  - DUI Institute graduate (University of Maryland)    VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On 05/27/2023 at approximately 0015 hours, I Trooper Moguche # 6582 of Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack, was dispatched to a single-vehicle collision that occurred on SB MD-5 north of MD-337, Prince Georges County Maryland. Upon my arrival, I met with Prince Georges County police officer who was on seen. I observed a gray Chrysler with Maryland registration 6EL4643 disabled in lane 1. I observed the vehicle had struck a guardrail, and it had heavy front end damage. There was also a black male subject who standing on the side of the roadway. While walking around the vehicle, I observed that the drivers door was open. I could detect a strong odor of Marijuana emitting from the vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I made contact with the male subject who was standing outside his vehicle, and I asked him if he was the driver to which he stated Yes. I identified the driver through his District of Columbia identification card as Creek, Khalil Rashid B/M DOB 10/26/1998. While speaking with Creek I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I observed his eyes were glassy and red/bloodshot. I asked him if he consumed any alcoholic beverage prior to operating the vehicle to which he stated Yes. I requested the driver to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Test to make sure he was safe to continue operating the vehicle safely which he accepted.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on a flat surface and free of any debris. The driver appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked the driver the following questions:  Glasses or contacts- No  Any physical defects- No  Sick or injured- No  Any drugs/medication- No    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from the drivers eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only without turning his head. His pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I asked him if he understood the directions to which he stated, Yes.    1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes  2.) The distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation  Present in both eyes  3.) The onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  * High Vertical Nystagmus  present.    WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed)  Before the driver performed the test, he was properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel-to-toe. He was instructed to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. He was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. He was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count every step out loud. On the ninth step, he was demonstrated and explained to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around to his left with his rear foot to turn completely around. He was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. He was then instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud.  During the instructional stage, Mr. Creek  1.) Lost balance and broke his feet apart. He couldnt remain in starting position.  Walking Stage (1st Nine)  * Missed heel-to-toe by more than an inch  *Stepped off the line  Turn: Completed unsatisfactorily. He turned in a fluid motion not as he was explained to.    Walking Stage (2nd Nine)    * Missed heel-to-toe by more than an inch.  *Stepped off the line    ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)     Before the driver performed the test, he was properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his side while the instructions were given during the test. He was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and continue the test until told to stop.    During the Test:    *He swayed during the test  * He hoped during the test.  *He put his foot down.    PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST  I explained and offered the Preliminary Breath Test to Mr. Creek to which he accepted to take at 0038 hours with the result of .16 BAC.  ARREST  Based on the following, I had reasons to believe that Mr. Creek was driving a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage from his breath.  * Red/bloodshot and glassy eyes.  *Observed signs of impairment as he performed Sobriety Tests.    I arrested Mr. Creek for driving while impaired at 0038 hours.  I secured Mr. Creek in my vehicle to conduct a Probable Cause Search of Mr.Creek vehicle.      Scene Processing:  A probable cause search of a vehicle resulted in the recovery of 10.32 grams with the packaging of suspected Marijuana.    Physical Evidence:  A). Picture of one heat-sealed bag containing a Ziploc bag with 10.32 grams of suspected Marijuana.  B). Attached Property Held Record P-336221 and Chain of Custody (MSP Form 67).  C). Attached Probable Cause Vehicle Search Report.  D). Attached Civil Citation #1Z46647651         The CDS was recognized through my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. The suspected marijuana was processed according to agency policy and regulations. The suspected Marijuana was recorded on MSP Form 67 Chain of Custody under the Property Held number P-P-336221. The total weight of 10.32 grams recovered suspected Marijuana was verified by Cpl. York #6327    At the Forestville Barrack, Mr. Creek was read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form in its entirety. After the form, he refused to take the breathalyzer test and signed at 0148 hours. Mr. Creek was issued with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, the DR-15A order suspension, and all citations. He was then released to a sober driver at Forestville. </NarrativeText>
