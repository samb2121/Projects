The CyberTips, generated by Discord, indicated that a subject uploading/possessing/distributing child pornography through the internet. The CyberTips were assigned to TFC Burnett for investigation.   The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the suspect: Cybertips: 154810863, 154810864 Email Address: fartb100@gmail.com (Verified) Screen/User Name: ChimpingApe#4240 ESP User ID: 1071177697394442291  Cybertips: 154471251, 154471253, 154471255 Phone: +14437713854 (Verified) Email Address: chimpingape@gmail.com (Verified) Screen/User Name: ChimpingApe#8983 ESP User ID: 1017903272851406950   TFC Burnett reviewed this CyberTip and observed it to contain five reported video files, one from each of the Cybertips. Two files contained child pornography as it is defined as Maryland law. Three files appeared to be a minor but was unable to be determined. The files are described below:  Cybertip: 154810863 age difficult Filename: VID_20230207_173017_411.mp4 Description: This file is a fifteen second colored video with the text Telegram: @mobakab907907 over the screen. The video depicts an unidenfidied nude person kneeling down, laying on a pillow, while an adult male rubs his erect penis on the persons anus/buttocks area. The unidentified persons body characteristics appears to be smaller compared to the adults penis and body.  Upload: 73.250.15.140 on 02-08-2023 at 23:44:43 UTC  Cybertip: 154810864 Filename: VID_20230107_205549_828.mp4 Description: This file is a twenty-seven second colored video of a Caucasian female child in a bathroom, the child removes her clothing and poses to the camera in a lascivious manner. Based on the size and physical development, the children appears to be 12-14 years of age.

The video depicts a close up of a prepubescent female childs vagina, while an adult male is sodomizing the child. The child is wearing white shorts with pink hearts that are around her calves and is devoid of pubic hair. Based on the size and physical characteristics and what is labeled as 4 years, it appears the child could possibly be around 4 years of age.

The female does have pubic hair and breast budding, but based on the size compared to the adult, the female appears to be under 18 years of age.  Upload: 73.250.15.140 on 02-03-2023 at 00:47:19 UTC  Cybertip: 154471255 Filename: VID_20230107_205731_308.mp4 Description: This file is a forty-four second colored video of a nude female child sitting on a bed performing fellatio on an adult males erect penis. Based on the size and physical characteristics, the child appears to be 3-5 years of age.  Upload: 73.250.15.140 on 02-03-2023 at 00:47:40 UTC   TFC Burnett conducted a query of the IP addresses through an open-source database. The suspects registration/login IP address 73.250.15.140 is registered through Comcast and geo locates to Prince Frederick, Maryland.  TFC Burnett conducted a query of the phone number through an open-source database. The phone returns to a Beanon Bruckner and is registered to T-Mobile. A search through a law enforcement database revealed the name of Beanon Bruckner Pilkins (W/M, DOB: 9/30/2006) and his mother, Kori Lynn Pilkins Hand (W/F, DOB: 12/31/1973) and his step-father, Christipher Robert Hand (W/M, DOB: 5/20/1976) who reside at 4425 Dares Beach Rd, MD which was verified.  TFC Burnett transmitted an investigative subpoena request for the Comcast IP address, Google email addresses, and T-Mobile phone number which were sent to the Howard County Office of the States Attorney. A preservation letter will be sent to Discord to preserve the suspects account.   A search warrant for the Discord account will be authored.    On 3/3/2023, at approximately 0743 hours, I conducted surveillance at 4425 Dares Beach Rd, MD and observed there only to be a dump truck in the driveway at this time.

Upon arrival, we made contact with the mother Kori Hand and explained the situation, which she was concerned and wanting to know the verdict of the case. Kori provided us with permission to talk with Beanon Pilkins, to figure out what the situation was with the Discord accounts.    We made contact with Beanon who advised that he was being blackmailed into sending 2-3 people child pornography. Beanon explained he has been chatting with people since last year 2022, and he started talking with a couple people on different Discord servers, who would tell him to find child pornography and send it to them. Beanon advised in the Discord servers he would ask for cp servers to get files. Beanon advised he did send 4or 5 images/videos of himself to people as well. Beanon explained that he last sent a child pornography image 3 days ago and deletes the files when he is done sending them.During our conversation, Beanon advised that he had no choice and is not interested in child pornography.

While browsing through Beanons purple Android One Plus 12, I observed there to be a child pornography image in the deleted folder of the photos app on the phone that was placed there 3 days ago, the file is described below. I also observed within the Discord chat with (Daddy, Duskmaven#8042) numerous child pornography files being sent to Beanon, at that point in time, I did not continue searching and seized the phone.  Filename: N/A Description: This image file depicts a nude Caucausian female child laying down with her legs spread in the air, exposing her vagina and anus.

         <NarrativeText>Attachment:   -Maryland Department of State Police Juvenile Release Form (53)  Narrative:  TFC Burnett received the forensic extraction from Bruckners One Plus 12 cellphone. I reviewed the Cellebrite extraction and observed it to contain numerous chats, mostly from Telegram and Twitter with random people, where Bruckner is asking for either videos/images of child pornography or to be added to different servers to obtain those files. I also observed the phone to obtain 470 image files and 220 video files depicting child pornography as it is defined by the Maryland Law. Three random files are described below:  -This file was located in a Telegram chat that the suspect sent to (Ouroboros) #587-328-7288  Filename: 1_5134608710601015922.mp4 Description: This file is a six second colored video depicting a Caucasian female child wearing a black and pink pants.

Pitcher and I responded to 4425 Dares Beach Road, Prince Frederick, Md to make contact with Kori Hand and Beanon Bruckner. Upon our arrival, we observed no lights on in the house and barely any vehicles in the driveway. Numerous knocks at the door were made with no answer.  At approximately 0748 hours, I contacted Kori Hand by phone (410-456-2144) and she explained that she was not living at the house right now due to the power being turned off. Hand advised she was staying with her mother at 5038 Erika Pl, Port Republic, MD. Hand was willing to meet up to go over the case status. I provided Sgt. Pitcher her contact information to schedule when Hand and Bruckner could meet with him for the paperwork. At approximately 1629 hours, I was contacted by Bruckners and Hands Attorney, Todd Mohink (410-766-0113) who advised he was hired by Hand and to follow up with him for anything further on the case. Later on, Sgt. Pitcher advised they scheduled to meet up with him on 12/7/2023.  On 12/7/2023, at approximately 1530 hours, Sgt. Pitcher made contact with Hand and Bruckner at the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack, where Bruckner was charged on a Maryland Department of State Police Juvenile Release Form (53).  MSP Form 53 (Juvenile Release Form) with the following: - Possession of Child Pornography (1 Count) - Distribution of Child Pornography (2 Counts)  Brucker was released to the care and custody of Hand. No further police action was initiated.  This case will be forwarded to Calvert County Juvenile Services for disposition.  Case closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
