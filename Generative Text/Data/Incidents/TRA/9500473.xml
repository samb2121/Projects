         <NarrativeText> width:99.04%"&gt;          width:99%"&gt;F-45 MVR equipped  BWC Operational     Defendant: Joshua Everett Dunkes    Date of Birth: 10/03/1996    Date of Arrest: 05/14/2023    Time of Arrest: 1431 hours    MD DL # D522440238762     DUI #: 23-075 (North East)        TRAINING CERTIFICATES:        I am trained by the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer standardized field sobriety tests and advanced roadside impaired driving tests.    Certified Golden Eagle II RADAR Operator    Preliminary Breath Test Operator Certified        VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):    On May 14, 2023 at 0128 hours,I, TFC Rafer of the Maryland State Police was traveling N/B Rt 213 N/O Spears Hill Rd, when I observed an adult female holding the hand of a child walking on the S/B shoulder. Behind the female, I observed a black Hyundai Sonata traveling behind them at a low rate of speed. I stopped and asked the female if she was okay, and she stated, Help me.    As I turned around, the Sonata parked, and a male operator exited the vehicle.         PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):        I exited my marked patrol vehicle and made contact with the distressed female and male driver.     I introduced myself, and informed them they were being audibly and visually recorded.     I questioned the couple regarding the events occurring and the female, identified as Katie Stickler (DOB 10/04/1991 W/F) advised they were on their way to a mothers day event on the Eastern Shore. The male, identified as Joshua Everett Dunkes (DOB 10/03/1996 W/M), blurted, She had enough of my shit, I was really fucked up. Dunkes advised he was pulling the car over.     Dunkes had a strong odor of alcohol emitting from his breath and person. Dunkes eyes appeared to be bloodshot and glassy, and he exhibited slurred speech and lethargic movements. I questioned if Dunkes had been drinking, and he nodded and said yes.     I questioned Dunkes if he was willing to conduct standard field sobriety tests. Dunkes wanted to know the ramifications of failing the tests. The standard operating procedures were explained, and Dunkes agreed to take the tests.         PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):        The surface was dry, essentially level, appeared to be free from obvious debris, and the weather was clear. Lighting conditions were daytime hours. Dunkes appeared to be in good physical condition and displayed no visible injuries.            I asked Dunkes the following questions:    Alcohol: Two shots    Medications: None    Glasses: Yes  Can see without    Injuries: None    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)        The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from DUNKESs eyes. DUNKES was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only. DUNKESs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.        1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes    Dunkes struggled to follow the stimulus.         2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes            3) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes        WALK AND TURN (3/8 clues observed)        Prior to DUNKES performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. DUNKES was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and heel touching toe. DUNKES was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position. DUNKES was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. DUNKES was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keeping his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, DUNKES was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. DUNKES was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. DUNKES was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count aloud each step. Dunkes was again instructed to not stop the test once he began. Dunkes nodded his head and said he understood.         Instructional Stage:        Maintained position: No         Start too soon: No        Walking Stage (1st Nine):        Total steps taken: 11         Stops mid test: Yes        Steps off line: No        Misses heel to toe: No        Raises arms: No        Turn: Completed Satisfactorily         Walking Stage (2nd Nine):        Total steps taken: 9        Stops mid test: No        Steps off line: No        Misses heel to toe: No        Raises arms: No            ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed): raised right foot.        Prior to DUNKES performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. DUNKES was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. DUNKES was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.        Counting and Balancing Stage:        Raised arms: No        Puts foot down: Yes        Sways: Yes        Hops: No        PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST:        Not offered.    ARREST:        Based on the following, I had reason to believe DUNKES was driving/attempting to drive a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:        *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person.    *Admitting to consuming alcohol (2 shots)    *Eyes bloodshot and glassy.    *Clues during standardized field sobriety testing.        Due to the number of observations, I concluded DUNKES was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 1431 hours, I placed DUNKES under arrest for driving/attempting to drive while under influence of alcohol.         Dunkes made the voluntary statement, Im drunk, when being placed in my vehicle.         While on scene, DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to DUNKES in English, at 1452 hours at which time he refused to take the intoximeter/breath test.            Dunkes was charged and released on scene to Stickler with the necessary paperwork.         Case closed by arrest.        </NarrativeText>
