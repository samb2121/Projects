         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack D-30 is equipped with mobile recording device Incident was captured on mobile recording device and BWC  Defendant: Christopher James Dent Jr Date of Birth: 01/17/1996 Date of Arrest: 04/05/2023 Time of Arrest: 0124 hours MD OLN: MD-10272469340 DUI # 23-092 (Bel Air)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:   I am trained by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer standardized field sobriety test.  I am a NHTSA certified SFST Instructor.  I am trained by the Maryland State Police and NHTSA in ARIDE.  I am certified by the NHTSA/IACP as a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE).  I am certified by the IACP as a DRE Instructor  I attended the 2019 DUI Conference in Ocean City, Maryland.  I attended the 2022 Maryland DRE Conference in Ocean City, Maryland.  I have completed the Cannabis intoxication/impairment workshop hosted by Montgomery County Police Department.  I have been a guest instructor at the Cannabis intoxication/impairment workshop hosted by Montgomery County Police for States Attorneys.  I am a certified LIDAR/RADAR operator through the Maryland State Police.  I am certified as a Preliminary Breath Test Operator through the Maryland State Police.  I am certified by the Maryland State Police as a License Plate Recognition operator.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 04/05/2023 at approximately 0031 hours, I (TFC Mott #6918) was on-duty operating unmarked patrol vehicle D-30. I was conducting routine patrol in the area of S/B MD-152 near Harford Rd. I observed a dark colored sedan make a sharp right turn from Harford Rd onto S/B MD-152. I observed the vehicle, a dark colored Acura sedan approach the intersection of S/B MD-152 and Belair Rd (US Rt-1). As the vehicle came to a stop, I observed the vehicles driver side brake light and third (center) brake light were not functional. As the light turned green, after our vehicles proceeded through the intersection I conducted a traffic stop on the Acura, which displayed Virginia temp registration K88009. The Acura was delayed in stopping, activating its hazards and sluggishly moving towards the shoulder. The Acura bypassed a larger shoulder and would come to a stop partially in the roadway south of Belair Rd. During the stop it was determined that this temp tag was supposed to be displayed on a Mercedes when it was actually on an Acura and the registration was expired.  PERSONNAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  Upon approaching the vehicle, I spoke with the operator of the vehicle and sole occupant, Christopher James Dent Jr (01/17/1996 B/M). As I was speaking with Dent, I observed multiple air fresheners strategically placed in the vehicle. I observed Dent had his seat lowered and reclined placing his silhouette behind the cars door pillar. Dent had just lite a cigarette as I was walking up on the vehicle. As I was speaking with Dent, I detected the odor of Marijuana emanating from the vehicle. I asked Dent if there was any Marijuana in the vehicle. Dent replied no but Marijuana had been in the vehicle a few days before. Dent stated that his friend had Marijuana in the vehicle then. As Dent was speaking with me, he was avoiding making eye contact. Dent would state that he was coming from work at FedEx at BWI. Dent stated that he was heading back to his girlfriends in Belcamp. Dents story did not add, he had bypassed more direct routes and was in Fallston, several towns away from his destination. During my conversation with Dent, I observed his eyes were glassy and his speech was slurred. Dent appeared drowsy as he searched his vehicle for the requested documentation. Dents movements were slow and deliberate. As a certified Drug Recognition Expert, I know these are general indicators of impairment. I requested Dent relocate the stop further south into the parking lot for Reckord Rd Park, Dent agreed. Upon the location of the stop being updated, I notified the Bel Air Barrack and requested another unit to my location. Upon an additional unit arriving on scene, a probable cause search was conducted on the vehicle. During the search, I located an orange pill bottle for Saad Akhund for Vyvanse 20 mg. Utilizing a pill identified, I observed Vyvanse is a schedule II controlled substance. I observed an additional pill bottle, but the pills were contained were not controlled. Additionally, I observed a scale in the center console and Narcan in the pouch behind the front passenger seat. When asked about the Vyvanse, Dent was not forth coming information and would attempt to say he allowed other people to use his vehicle. Based on my observations of Dent, I requested he submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Dent would agree to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation took place in the parking lot of the Reckord Park. The surface was dry, level and free from obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spot light and my flashlight. Dent appeared to be in good health and did not show any visible signs of injury. Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST manual. Dents pupils were constricted (pinpoint) but equal in size. Equal tracking was observed and resting nystagmus was not observed.    Lack of smooth pursuit  present in both eyes  Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation  present in both eyes   margin-left:8px"&gt;Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees  present in both eyes with an estimated angle of onset at 35 degree.  Vertical nystagmus was not observed. Walk and Turn (4/8 clues observed) The Walk and Turn was explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST manual. Dent stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be completed. Instructional Phase:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Failed to maintain balance  1st Nine Steps:    Stops walking on step 9 and asked for instructions   margin-left:8px"&gt;Missed heel to toe  2nd Nine Steps:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Missed heel to toe  Turn: Completed unsatisfactorily.  One Leg Stand (2/4 clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST manual. Dent stated he understood the test and how the test was to be completed. Seconds 01-10     margin-left:8px"&gt;Raised arms for balance  Seconds 11-20     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing observed  Seconds 21-30    Raised arms for balance   margin-left:8px"&gt;Sways   Lack of Convergence The Lack of convergence test was administered to Dent. As the stimulus approached the bridge of Dents nose, Dents eyes fails to follow the stimulus. Dents eyes shot down and to the left on both attempts at the test.  Modified Romberg Balance For this test, Dent was asked to think about the passing of 30 seconds and to say when 3 second had passed. During the 30 second test, it took Dent 30 seconds to complete the test.  Dent was offered a Preliminary Breath Test on scene, which he agreed to take. The result of the test was .00 Br.A.C.  Arrest Based on the following, I had reason to believe Dent was operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs:    Glassy, bloodshot eyes  Slow, slurred speech  Inability to concentrate  Drowsy  Slow deliberate movements while searching for requested documents   margin-left:8px"&gt;Clues during field sobriety  Due to my observations and based on my training, knowledge and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and certified Drug Recognition Expert, I concluded that Dent was operating a motor vehicle while impaired and unsafe to do so. At approximately 0124 hours, I placed Dent under arrest for DUI/DWI as well as possession of CDS. A preliminary search of Dent was conducted on scene and he was placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle per department policy. While still on scene, I conferred with TFC McMachan #6940. TFC McMachan advised that while I was searching the vehicle, Dent was making several comments on the phone, which lead TFC McMachan to believe further criminal activity was afoot. TFC McMachan continued the search of the vehicle and would locate Suspected CDS hidden in the steering wheel column. TFC McMachan located an additional bag hidden underneath the steering wheel. See TFC McMachans supplement for additional. Upon opening the black baggie, I observed numerous vials, which I know from my training, knowledge and experience as a State Trooper to be used in the distribution of controlled substances. Additionally located in the black baggie were thirty-seven (37) gel capsules containing suspected Heroin/Fentanyl. When combine with the scale, which was previously located in the vehicle, the amount of suspected CDS in combination with all the packaging present lead me to being that Dent was involved in distributing controlled substances. Photos of the CDS were taken and uploaded to this report. While the vehicle was still being searched, Dents level of sobriety greatly deteriorated. Dent was now even drowsier and was now visibly on the nod. Dents level of sobriety would maintain this level of impairment for the remainder of my time with him. I transported Dent to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack for processing. Dent was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights at 0205 hours. Dent agreed to the test. The breath test was administered by Sgt Stec #5182 of the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack. At 0223 hours, Dent successfully took the test, with a result of .00 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Due to observations of Dents level of impairment, EMS was requested to the Barrack for evaluation. Dent would refuse additional treatment. Due to Dents level of impairment and my training as a DRE, I believed Dent to be under the influence of drugs or CDS and requested a DRE respond to the Barrack. Sgt. Henize #941 of the Harford County Sheriffs Office responded to the Barrack to assist. Sgt. Henize #941 (DRE cert. #34202) conducted a 12 step DRE Evaluation of Mr. Dent at the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack. In his opinion as a Drug Recognition Expert, Mr. Dent is impaired by a Narcotic Analgesic and CNS Depressant and is unable to operate a motor vehicle safely. Sgt. Henize advised Mr. Dent of his opinion and asked him to submit to a blood test for drugs. Sgt. Henize also advised Mr. Dent of the penalties for refusing to submit to the blood test. After being so advised, Mr. Dent agreed to submit to the blood test. See Sgt. Henizes DRE report for further information. Dent was transported to Harford County IPC for a blood kit as well as additional processing. At approximately 0456 hours RN Bukovsky, a qualified medical person successfully drew blood from Dent, which I witnessed and immediately took possession of. The blood kit was processed according to State Police policy and procedure. Dent would remain in the custody of IPC for his initial appearance. The suspected CDS was seized from the scene and processed according to Maryland State Police policy and procedure under P-334657. Dents vehicle was secured on scene. Dent was provided with copies of pertinent paperwork. A VSR was completed in DELTA PLUS. DUI/DWI charges are pending results of the blood kit Dent was advised he was not allowed to driver for 12 hours. Maryland State Police CED DED was notified. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. I request this case remain open pending blood test results.  *** Evidence seized and submitted on P-334657****    One plastic baggie labeled A containing 37 gel capsules containing off white powdery substance weight: 18.8 Grams.  One plastic bag labeled B containing 10 blue glass vials with trace amounts white powdery substances.  One plastic bag labeled C containing 11 multi-colored plastics caps/lids with trace amounts white powdery substances.   margin-left:8px"&gt;One plastic bag labeled D containing 17 yellow gel capsules S489 20mg weight 9.2 grams.

         <NarrativeText>Recording: D-27 is equipped with BWC/MVR. Interaction was captured.  TRAINING / CERTIFICATES: I am a certified police officer in the State of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection at the Maryland State Police Academy. My training has led to numerous arrests for impaired driving. I am trained by the Maryland State Police to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. I am a certified Preliminary Breath Test operator through the Maryland State police. I am a graduate of the Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement course (A.R.I.D.E.). I was recognized as a DUI Law Enforcement Awardee by the Maryland Highway Safety Office. I am a certified Advanced Collision Investigator through the Maryland State Police. I attended the Maryland Impaired Driving Conference in 2022. I successfully completed the 16-hour PACE Team Training Course approved by the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division.  ACTION TAKEN: On 04/05/2023 at approximately 0031 hours I, TFC McMachan #6940 of the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks responded to the Reckord Park parking lot, to assist TFC Mott #6914 with his traffic investigation. TFC Mott requested Dent step out of his vehicle, so he could conduct a probable cause search of it. I immediately observed numerous air freshness placed in various locations of the vehicle. I immediately detected the strong odor of marijuana emanating from the interior of the Acura. I observed Dent to have a freshly lit cigarette in his mouth. I observed Dents movements to be slow and lethargic as he exited the vehicle. Dents eyes appeared to be bloodshot, watery and glassy.  I spoke with Dent as TFC Mott conducted a probable cause search of the Acura. I asked Dent where he was coming from this evening to which, he advised he just got off work at FedEx. I asked Dent which FedEx facility he worked at to which, he advised BWI. Dent advised he lived in Woodlawn, Maryland. Dent advised he was heading to his girlfriends residence in Harford County, Maryland. It should be noted Dents route of travel was not consistent with where he said he was coming from and heading to. While speaking with Dent I observed him to wrap his arms around himself (self hug) on numerous occasions. Furthermore, while speaking with Dent, he avoided eye contact with me, and continuously scrolled through his phone.  TFC Mott located a visa card with the name Kevin on it. Dent advised Kevin was a friend of his. Dent could not advise what Kevins last name was. Dent stated he only had two friends named Kevin in his phone. I asked Dent how good of friends these Kevins are to him if he doesnt know their last names to which, he stated thats the thing like. Theyre more or less acquaintances.  Dent made a phone call to an unknown individual. The individual asked Dent a question to which, he looked up at his vehicle and mumbled Its possible. Dent then began to talk about the reason for the traffic stop and where he was currently located. It should be noted Dents volume was louder when he began to speak about his Acuras lights not working properly.  Based off TFC Motts observations, he requested Dent perform standardized field sobriety tests to which, he agreed. Based off TFC Motts observations, he placed Dent under arrest for driving under the influence.  Based on the following indicators, TFC Mott and I believed further criminal activity was afoot: - Excessive amount of air fresheners in vehicle - Multiple cell phones in vehicle - Utilize B Pillar for concealment - Immediately lighting up cigarette - Lack of eye contact - Self grooming - repeated wipe of face, back of neck, self hug - Taking items with him when he exited the vehicle - cell phone - inconsistent route of travel - Impaired by controlled dangerous substance  I lowered the steering wheel of the Acura. Upon lowering the steering wheel, I observed numerous clear glass vials containing a white powdery substance on top portion of the steering wheel that connects to the dashboard. Based on my training, knowledge and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, and through previous CDS cases, I know the aforementioned to be crack cocaine, a schedule II controlled dangerous substance.  Furthermore, I observed a black plastic bag behind the steering wheel and underneath the dashboard of the Acura. The bag contained the following: - Numerous clear gel capsules containing off-white powdery substance - multicolored plastic caps/lids with trace amounts white powdery substance - blue glass vials containing trace amounts white powdery substance  Based on my training knowledge and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and through previous CDS cases, I know the aforementioned to be Heroin/Fentanyl a schedule I and II controlled dangerous substance and crack cocaine, a schedule II controlled dangerous substance.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.   </NarrativeText>
