         <NarrativeText>The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera.  Defendant: David Paul Markowski, Jr.  Date of Birth: 11/05/1966 Date of Arrest: 12/09/2023 Time of Arrest: 0126 hours MD SDX: M-622-135-676-851 DUI #: 23-205  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:  * Trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of November 2017. * I am a graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2023. * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR though the Maryland State Police as of March 2017. * I have apprehended more than 150 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  *SEE TFC. JEANS #6483 Supplement*   On Saturday, December 9, 2023, at approximately 0109 hours, I, TFC. Lowe #6739, was in uniform of the day, operating unmarked MSP vehicle, J-21. At that time, I was in the area of West St and Glen Ave, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland 21401. TFC. Jeans #6483 then dispatched to me over the radio that there was a vehicle traveling north bound in the south bound lanes of Rowe Blvd prior to Taylor Ave. TFC. Jeans already had a prisoner and could not exit his vehicle, so he conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle and held the vehicle until I arrived. At that time, I activated my emergency equipment and responded to his location, Rowe Blvd at Taylor Ave.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I arrived on scene and observed a gray Ford Taurus, bearing Maryland registration, 9CM4150, pulled over in front of TFC. Jeans police vehicle on the right shoulder. TFC. Jeans left the scene and Sgt. Jones pulled behind the Ford. Sgt. Jones left the scene to handle TFC. Jeans arrest and I waited for Annapolis City Police to arrive on scene. When Annapolis City arrived, I exited my vehicle and approached the drivers side window of the Ford. I introduced my self to the male operator and advised him he was being recorded. I asked the male what happened, and he advised he was not familiar with the area. The male then handed me his license and I identified him by his Maryland drivers license as, David Paul Markowski, Jr, W/M, DOB: 11/05/1966 (hereinafter referred to as Markowski.) I immediately noticed Markowskis eyes were extremely bloodshot and glassy. I asked Markowski where he was coming from and he advised, The Westin. I then asked Markowski for his registration card which he provided to me. I asked Markowski what he was doing at the Westin and he advised it was a company party. As he spoke, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle and I also noticed his speech was slow and slurred. I asked Markowski if the address on his license was the same and he replied, Yes sir, I mean, yes maam. I then advised Markowski that I could smell alcohol and I asked him how much he had to drink before he drove and he replied, Ive had about 3 since about 6:15pm. I then advised Markowski that I would be right back with him and I returned to my patrol vehicle.   A check through METERS and MVA revealed that Markowski was driving on a valid Maryland drivers license.   I approached Markowski again and advised him that because I could smell alcohol, I wanted him to exit his vehicle for a series of tests and he complied. I observed Markowski chewing on something and asked if he had gum in his mouth which he did. I then asked Markowski to spit his gum out and he complied. I asked Markowski when his last alcoholic beverage was and he stated, About 45 minutes ago. I asked Markowski what type of alcoholic drink he consumed and he replied, Bourbon.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed roadside. The weather was clear and approximately 43 degrees Fahrenheit. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, and my flashlight. The road was level and free from any debris. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Markowski was wearing a navy suit with black dress shoes. Markowski appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any major visible injuries when walking from the vehicle. While speaking with Markowski outside his vehicle, I again detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, this time emitting from his breath and person.   Markowski was asked the following questions:    margin-left:31px"&gt;Do you have any medical conditions or injuries- Plantar fasciitis    margin-left:31px"&gt;Are you on any medications  None    margin-left:31px"&gt;Do you wear glasses or contacts?  Reading glasses which were on his head.   I asked Markowski if he had hit his head recently, and he replied, No.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test that was given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA manual,Markowski stated he understood the instructions. Markowskidisplayed the following clues:  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.    WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA manual. Markowskidisplayed the following clues:  Instructional Stage:     As I was still explaining the instructions, Markowski started the test too soon and attempted to start walking forward.    Walking Stage (1st Nine)    Markowski missed heel to toe on all 9 steps  Stepped off line on step 5 and nearly fell over  Stopped walking after the last step  Raised arms for balance on step 5   Turn: Nothing to report   Walking Stage (2nd Nine):     Markowski missed heel to toe on all 9 steps  Stepped off line on steps 2, 3, 8 and 9. Markowski nearly fell off balance again on step 3.   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA manual.I asked Markowski if he understood and he advised that he did. Markowski displayed the following clues.  Markowski began by lifting his left foot.  Balance and Counting Stage:    Put foot down on counts 1003, 1005, 1006, 1009, 1010, 1013, 1016, 1017, 1018 and 1019. On count 1019, Markowski stumbled to the right and I reached out to make sure he did not fall.   Swayed on counts 1004 and 1005.  Raised arms for balance on counts 1004, 1005 and 1019.     Other observations: Markowski barely raised his foot off the ground. I told him multiple times to raise it higher.   While on scene, Markowski was offered a preliminary breath test which he agreed to and revealed a result of .11.    Based on my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and the following, I had reason to believe Markowski was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:     margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from breath   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Eyes glassy and bloodshot.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Admission to consuming alcohol   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Slow and slurred speech   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Positive preliminary testing    margin-left:16px"&gt;Clues during field sobriety tests   Due to the number of observations, I concluded Markowski was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0126 hours, I placed Markowski under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Markowski was placed in handcuffs without incident. A preliminary search of Markowski was conducted on scene and there were no foreign objects in his mouth at the time. Markowski was then placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle per Maryland State Police policy. While in my vehicle, I could still detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. Markowski was transported to the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack for processing.  20 Minute Observation Period  A secondary search was conducted upon arrival at the Barrack and revealed that Markowski had nothing in his mouth. I played Markowski the DR-15 Advice of Rights via the Motor Vehicle Administration audio recording. Markowski was given a copy to follow along with as it played. At 0152 hours, Markowski agreed to submit to an Intoximeter test. Sgt. Jones #1788 of the Maryland State Police administered the test. The test revealed that Markowski had an alcohol concentration of .11 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.   Markowski was polite and cooperative the entire process. Markowski was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was released to a sober driver.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On December 9, 2023, at approximately 0110 hours, I was en-route to the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack. At that time, I was operating unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle J-16. I was southbound on Rowe Blvd approaching Taylor Ave., Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland when I observed a gray Ford Taurus bearing Maryland Registration 9CM4150 coming toward my vehicle, traveling the wrong way on Rowe Blvd. I called out the location of the violation and had Tfc Lowe #6739 start my way. Due to the fact I had a prisoner in my patrol car, I did not make contact with the operator. I was able to safely get the vehicle turned around and get it to the correct side of the roadway and off to the right shoulder. I stayed behind the vehicle and waited for another unit to arrive. Sgt. Jones #1788 was first to relieve me, so I could get my prisoner to the Annapolis Barrack for processing. Tfc Lowe then arrived on-scene and requested Annapolis City Police Department, so she could put the driver through Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Tfc Lowe ultimately arrested the driver for suspicion of DUI.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
