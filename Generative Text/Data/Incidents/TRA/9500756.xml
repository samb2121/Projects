         <NarrativeText> On May 19, 2023, I, S/T S. DiToto #5416 was conducting a review of firearms related pawn transactions utilizing the Regional Automated Property Information Database (RAPID). During this review a transaction was located having been conducted by Stefan Paul Przewlocki (W/M, DOB: 09/02/1992) of Arnold, Maryland. I conducted multiple checks of various resources and determined Przewlocki is prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition due to the below captioned reasons. A further check of RAPID was conducted which revealed a total of four transactions conducted by Przewlocki at two pawn shops in Anne Arundel County between January 2023 and March 2023. Those transactions are captioned below.  PAWN TRANSACTIONS:  1) 01/16/23 @ 1214, Ticket # 41470  Arundel Firearms  Pawn, 7427 BA Boulevard, Glen Burnie, MD  - Anderson AM15 Upper Receiver 5.56 w/ S/N: 20221862  2) 02/24/23 @ 1256, Ticket # 41505  Arundel Firearms  Pawn, 7427 BA Boulevard, Glen Burnie, MD  - AR Upper Receiver Assembly .223, S/N: None  3) 02/24/23 @ 1302, Ticket # 41505  Arundel Firearms  Pawn, 7427 BA Boulevard, Glen Burnie, MD  - Mauser 1896 Bolt Action rifle, S/N: 449613 w/ case  4) 03/06/23 @ 1124, Ticket # 96627  AD Pawn Shop, 706 N. Crain Highway, Glen Burnie, MD  - Norinco SKS rifle, S/N: 2311549  PROHIBITING FACTORS:  1. Court System: District Court for Anne Arundel County  Criminal  Case #: 5A00256562  Offense: Burglary  Fourth Degree  Disposition: Guilty  Disposition Date: 07/25/13  2. Court System: Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County  Criminal  Case #: 02K13001705  Offense: Burglary  Fourth Degree  Disposition: Guilty  Disposition Date: 12/19/16  3. Court System: Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County  Criminal  Case #: C02CR17001094  Offense: Burglary  First Degree  Disposition: Guilty  Disposition Date: 03/19/19  4. Court System: Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County  Criminal  Case #: C02CR17002038  Offense: Unauthorized Removal of Property CR 7-203  Disposition: Guilty  Disposition Date: 03/19/23   True Test/Certified copies verifying the captioned convictions will be obtained prior to further enforcement action.   Przewlocki was found to have an Active Warrant through Anne Arundel County Sheriffs Office listed in NCIC for FTA  First Degree Burglary (VOP) in relation to captioned case #3.   I contacted Arundel Firearms and Pawn who confirmed the Mauser rifle was still in their possession, however the other items were since sold to a new customer. Due to some of the items being uppers only and not complete firearms or lower receivers, there may be limited information regarding the new customer. The owner of Arundel Firearms and Pawn advised he would locate and retain all information related to this investigation for pick up when the rifle is recovered. Contact was made with AD Pawn who confirmed the SKS rifle was still in their possession and a hold was placed on that firearm pending recovery. It was found while speaking with AD Firearm Pawn that in March of 2022 (Approx. 1 year prior) Przewlocki conducted a transaction at their shop involving parts for an AR15 upper. This prompted additional checks of rapid which showed record of that transaction as well as a transaction at Arundel Firearms and Pawn in April 2022 where Przewlocki pawned scopes, barrels and AR15 upper receiver parts as well. Copies of these transactions are also attached to this report. Although not firearms by definition, the presence of the parts over time indicate potential access to other firearms or associated lower receivers. A date and time coordinated with Anne Arundel County Police Department Pawn Administrator will be set for the recovery of the identified firearms on hold.   Additional checks of Przewlocki did not provide identifiable leads regarding this investigation, however further checks are to be conducted. A Facebook profile belonging to Przewlocki was located, but no firearms information was observed in the publicly visible section.   I conducted further checks of the firearms or serialized firearm parts observed in the pawn transaction. This check revealed no NCIC lost/stolen files. A result was located in MAFSS for the Anderson AM15 (S/N: 20221862) as being registered to Bernard Stanley Przewlocki Jr of 1277 Ritchie Highway, APT 196, Arnold, MD. This is the same address primarily used by the suspect as well on his Maryland MVA record; However, a second contact address is also listed at 330 Gladwater Court, APT 204, Glen Burnie, Maryland. Additional investigation is being conducted regarding the second address and its occupants as well. In regards to Bernard Przewlocki Jr, he was found to be listed as a Collector in his MAFSS record and the owner of multiple registered firearms.   Preliminary searches of other resources have revealed reports from Anne Arundel County Police Department involving Bernard Przewlocki Jr reporting firearms missing or stolen from his residence. In the report it addressed Stefan Przewlocki who was interviewed and denied involvement. There were inconsistencies with Benerds statement and family expressed concerns regarding his memory and possible dementia and declining mental health. This specific report was dated November of 2020.   On June 12, 2023 at approximately 1205 hours, I responded to Arundel Firearms and Pawn and seized the Mauser 1896 6mm bolt action rifle (S/N: 449613). S/T S. DiToto verified that one transaction listed as an upper but included a serial number was in fact a fully assembled rifle. The information about the customer who later purchased that rifle was obtained for future contact. Copies of the pawn records were requested and later forwarded via email. There were no further records or information regarding this transaction.   At approximately 1235 hours, I responded to AD Pawn and seized the Norinco SKS 7.62 rifle (S/N: 2311549). S/T S. DiToto obtained copies of the pawn transaction record with the suspects signature. The shop employees were interviewed about the transaction but no further information was obtained.   The seized rifles were transported to CED Headquarters where they were packaged and stored as evidence under Property Record #P-344582. The recovery was assisted by Anne Arundel County Police Pawn Administrator L. Dohoney.   Case remains open pending further investigation.  Above events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText> Since previous investigative efforts, Stefan Przewlocki had been located by Anne Arundel County Police and arrested on the outstanding violation of probation warrant. I, ST S. DiToto #5416, contacted Anne Arundel County Detention Center, where Przewlocki is being held pending trial, to schedule an interview.   On October 11, 2023 at approximately 1040 hours, Cpl. J. Warrick #6324 and I conducted a knock and talk at 1277 Rictchie Highway, #196, Arnold, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Investigators contacted Bernard Przewlocki, Stefans father and the owner of the pawned firearms. Bernard confirmed he did own those firearms and he appeared to not know they were pawned. He advised he was not reporting them stolen. Bernard he stated he was planning to sell some firearms as he was no longer in good health and may need the money. Bernard advised Stefan did not have access to any of his other firearms and does not live with him. Bernard stated Stefan lives with his girlfriend who is possibly named Amanda but he did not know specific details. Bernard was advised of the status of his firearms. He explained Stefan has had issues with substance abuse resulting in legal troubles, but was recently improving after being arrested. No further information was obtained from Bernard and the interview was concluded.   On October 20, 2023 at approximately 0900 hours, I responded to Anne Arundel County Detention Center, Ordnance Road, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and contacted Stefan Przewlocki to conduct an interview. Przewlocki was read his Advice of Miranda Rights and signed an MSP 180. Przewlocki stated he did conduct the pawn transactions and was allowed access to the specific firearms from his father who was the owner. Przewlocki stated the firearms were not stolen and are kept in safes that he generally does not have access or a combination to. Przewlocki stated he no longer resides with his father and does not have access to firearms when released from custody. Przewlocki stated he conducted the pawns to gain money to support his CDS addiction. Przewlocki had no further information to provide regarding this investigation. Przewlocki was sentenced on 10/23/2023 for violation of probation and sentenced to serve 18 months in AACDC.    On October 25, 2023 the District Court for Anne Arundel County issued an Arrest Warrant for Stefan Paul Przewlocki for three counts of PS 5 206 Rifle Possession Felony Conviction and three counts of PS 5 205 Rifle Possession Disqualification. The warrant was placed as a detainer pending Przewlockis release from the Ordnance Road Detention Facility. On November 14, 2023 at approximately 1500 hours, MSP Glen Burnie Barrack was notified of Przewlockis pending release. Trooper Litz #7362 of MSP Glen Burnie Barrack responded to the Ordnance Road Detention Facility and served the warrant to Przewlocki without incident. Case closed by arrest.  Above events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
