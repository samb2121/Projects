         <NarrativeText>DUI Case # 23-140 CASE # 22-MSP-019258 D-19 with in-car camera. Stop recorded.  TRAINING: STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY CERTIFIED A.R.I.D.E (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) CERTIFIED 2021 DUI CONFERENCE  DEFENDANT: Danielle Locklear 12/09/1980 8412 Kavanagh Rd Dundalk, MD 21222  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion On May 29th, 2023, at approximately 2053 hours, I, TPR Neal #7283, of the Maryland State Police - Bel Air Barrack, was on duty, and dispatched to the area of 1807 Philadelphia Rd for an injury collision. Upon arrival on scene, I observed a crowd of people and a woman sitting on the ground. I observed a Ford Explorer off-road to the right of the roadway and partially in a ditch. I observed property damage to three mailboxes and the county drainage pipe that was beneath the driveway.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact Upon approach to the woman who identified herself as the driver, I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanated from her breath and person. The driver displayed bloodshot and glassy eyes. The driver looked dazed and confused and had bruising along her face and collarbone.  The driver was visibly upset and stated that she lost control of the vehicle and was trying to pay attention to the dog (was unharmed in the collision and had been caught by bystanders after the collision). The driver was breathing heavily and I asked if she needed medical assistance. At this time, the driver stated she had a pacemaker recently implanted. A bystander stated she also may have hit her head. She slurred that she broke her glasses as well.  As the driver breathed heavily in and out, I again smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person.  I identified the driver by her name and date of birth as Danielle Locklear (white/female, DOB: 12/09/1980). As I was attempting to write down her last name, she referred to the name Heather Locklear twice to assist in spelling her name instead of completing the spelling.  I asked Locklear how many alcoholic beverages she had, in which she stated 2 miniatures.  I started a tow for the vehicle, which was missing a passenger side tire. The vehicle was crushing three mailboxes of 1715A, 1803 and 1805 Philadelphia Rd.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening Locklear was wearing black leggings and a gray t-shirt.  Eyeglasses  No Injuries  chest pain, bruising of the chin and collarbone Medial Conditions  Lupus and Pacemaker  Locklear stated that she had consumed 2 shots but thought it had been hours prior. She then randomly stated that I had to understand that she had gastric bypass surgery. Locklear then asked her dog what time the had left them, referring to when she had drank the alcoholic beverages. Locklear, not getting a response from the chocolate Labrador, stated it had been hours, and she had drank water since then.  Locklear stated she had been attempting to adjust the air conditioner for the dog when she lost control of the vehicle. Looking at the tire marks and damage, the vehicle ran off roadway to the right, drove into the ditch, struck the county drainage pipe in front of 1803, struck the raised driveway and became airborne, made impact with the ditch and lost her passenger side tire and struck three mailboxes before coming to rest in the ditch.  I am trained through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in administrating Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus  Unable to complete  Walk and Turn  Unable to complete One Leg Stand  Unable to complete  Based on my training at the Maryland State Police Academy, knowledge, and experience, I declared Locklear under arrest for Driving under the Influence at 2146 hours.  The ambulance arrived on scene and evaluated Locklear, determining she needed to receive care at Bayview Hospital. Locklears sister-in-law was called to retrieve the dog.  While in the rear of the ambulance I read the DR 15 Advice of Rights form to Locklear. At 2146 hours, Locklear agreed to submit to the Alcohol Concentration Test via a blood kit at Bayview.  I responded to Bayview hospital where I made contact in the ambulance bay waiting area. Locklear advised that she no longer wanted to take the test and refused the blood draw. I had Locklear sign a new DR-15 stating such and provided her with the appropriate citations and copies.  Case closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland</NarrativeText>
