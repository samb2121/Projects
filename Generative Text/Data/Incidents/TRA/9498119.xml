         <NarrativeText>Renata Sarah Young Maryland SOUNDEX: Y-520-734-758-263 Breath Test Result: .Refused DUI Citation # 5QQ0T5Y DUI Tape #: Video tagged as 23-MSP-003618 (Axon View XL Software)   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.). * Completed and graduated from the DUI Institute.  * Completed and graduated SFST Instructor school  NARRATIVE -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION- On January 28, 2023 at approximately 2256 hours, I (TFC. S. Shubert #6944), was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating unmarked MSP vehicle V-08 in the area of eastbound US 50 at Inlet Isle Lane, Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland.   I was sitting stationary on the right shoulder of US 50. I looked in my drivers side rearview mirror and observed a white Chevrolet traverse bearing Maryland registration (6DX6439) traveling eastbound US 50 at Inlet Isle Lane in lane two. I observed the white Chevrolet traverse passenger side tires cross the right shoulder solid white line by approximately one foot and then drift back into lane two. As the white Chevrolet traverse passed my patrol vehicle. I again observed the white Chevrolet traverse drift to the right shoulder. I observed the white Chevrolet passenger side tires straddle the right shoulder solid white line for approximately 50 feet.   I observed the white Chevrolet traverse appeared to be traveling above the posted 35 MPH speed limit. The in-car Kustom Golden Eagle II front radar antenna was activated (same direction mode) and had been checked before (and later after) my shift and appeared to be functioning properly. I am certified through the Maryland State Police to operate Radar/Lidar. I made the following observations:  Eastbound US 50   A speed of 51 MPH in a posted 35 MPH zone was displayed on my in-car radar unit (same direction mode) as the vehicle entered the influence of the radar beam.  I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop.    -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT- I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver via the driver side door. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. I informed the driver the reason for the traffic stop and requested her drivers license and registration card. I asked the driver where she was traveling from, and she replied: Salisbury. I also observed the driver to display a dazed/expression look on her face. The driver was identified through her Maryland drivers license as Renata Sarah Young. I asked Young how many alcoholic beverages she consumed prior to operating her motor vehicle and Young stated No alcohol. As Young spoke, I intentionally observed her eyes to be glassy and bloodshot. I also observed Young movements to be lethargic. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks on Young.   I then returned to the white Chevrolet traverse and I asked Young to step out of her vehicle and walk to the front of it, which she complied. I then asked Young where she was coming from and Young stated Royal Farms. I asked Young if she consumed any alcoholic beverages prior to operating her motor vehicle and Young stated I havent had any. I then asked Young if she wanted to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to insure she was not impaired and Young agreed to submit to the tests.   -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING- STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs) The evaluation was performed on the sidewalk/parking area. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of overhead lighting and my flashlight. Young appeared to be in general good physical condition and did not display any limps or any limb ailments. Young was wearing blue jeans and a black jacket.   **HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: 6 of 6 clues**  1. Young displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  2. Young displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. 3. Young displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. ^^^I observed Young to display vertical nystagmus during the test^^^  **WALK AND TURN: 6 of 8 clues** -Could not maintain balance during the instruction phase -Started the test too soon First nine steps: -Stepped off line by approximately two inches on steps 4,5,7,8,9 -Missed heel to toe by approximately two inches on step 1,2,3,6  Turn: Completed unsatisfactory, lifted lead foot Second nine steps: -Raised arms from sides by approximately twelve to fourteen inches on steps 7,8,9 -Missed heel to toe by approximately two inches on steps 1,3,5 -Stepped off line by approximately two inches on steps 2,4,6   **ONE LEG STAND: 2 of 4 clues** -Young firmly placed her left foot down four times during the test. -Raised arms from sides by approximately twelve to fourteen inches two times during the test.   I asked Young if she could read and recite the English alphabet and Young stated Yes. I then asked if she could recite the English alphabet starting at the letter H ending at the letter T Young stated she understood and recited the following:  H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z   After the conclusion of all Field Sobriety Tests, I offered Young the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). Young agreed to submit to a preliminary breath test. Which resulted in .21 BrAC.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Young was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person.  * My observed signs of impairment as she performed field sobriety tests.  *lethargic movements  I placed Young under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2317 hours on January 28, 2023. At this time, I visually inspected the inside of Young mouth for any foreign objects and none were found.    ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) Young was placed and secured in the right front seat of my patrol vehicle. Young was given her Advice of Rights via the audio version of the DR-15 Form. I placed a copy of the DR-15 in front of Young. Once the DR-15 was completed being played Young stated that she understood her Advice of Rights. I then transported Young back to the Maryland State Police Berlin barrack for processing. I observed Young to be extremely loud and say inappropriate statements like Take me to the brick room and Ill show you something.  At approximately 0007 hours, Young refused to submit to the Intoximeter Test.   PROCESSING During all aspects of processing (mugshot, completion and explanation of the DR-15A Form, issuance and explanation of citations), the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Young continued to be strong.  CHARGES Young was charged with the following citations: 1. Driving Vehicle While Under The Influence Of Alcohol (5QQ0T5Y) 2. Driving While Impaired By Alcohol (5QR0T5Y) 3. Negligent driving (5QS0T5Y) 4. Exceeding the posted speed limit (5QT0T5Y) 5. Failure to obey designated lane directions (5QV0T5Y) Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Worcester County, MD. </NarrativeText>
