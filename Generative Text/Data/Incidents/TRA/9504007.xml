         <NarrativeText>DWI # 23-057  MD SDX: R-362-051-244-270  All events were captured on MSP Audio and Video:23-MSP-007291 DUI 6H80G2T,23-MSP-007291 DUI 6H80G2T TRANSLATION.  PHASE ONE: VEHICLE IN MOTION  On February 26, 2023 at approximately 0244 hours, I, Senior Trooper Whittenberg (#6095) of the Maryland State Police - Bel Air Barrack responded to the area of northbound Belair Road and Whitaker Mill Road for a single vehicle motor vehicle collision. Upon arrival, I observed a gray Chevrolet Cruze, with all airbags deployed, bearing Maryland registration 8ET9989 halfway underneath a parked U-Haul truck in the parking lot of 1515 Belair Road, Fallston, MD.  PHASE TWO: PERSONAL CONTACT  I then went to the drivers side of the vehicle and there was only a single occupant of the vehicle. The driver of the suspect vehicle was a hispanic male and was bleeding from his hands and face. I also observed that the drivers side seat belt had not been extended, indicating the driver was not wearing his seat belt at the time of the collision. The driver was moved away from the collision scene due to a large gas leak coming from the struck U-Haul truck.  I then spoke to a witness, identified by her Maryland drivers license to be Ada Orellana Cedillos. She stated that she observed the suspect vehicle as it came into Harford County, from Baltimore County on Belair Road, and she stated she saw the suspect vehicle almost have a collision before this one. She stated the suspect vehicle was traveling northbound and then all of a sudden lost control and drove over the curb at the intersection of Belair Road and Whitaker Mill Road and then struck the U-Haul truck.  The driver of the suspect vehicle was identified through his Maryland drivers license to be Allan Fabrici Rodriguez Lainez (H/M 04/06/1994). I made contact with the suspect driver and asked him what happened. The driver looked at me with a blank stare and did not respond. I asked the driver again what happened, and he still looked at me confused. I found out that the driver could only speak spanish. While speaking withLainez I could detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person as well as bloodshot, glassy, watery eyes.Lainez confirmed that he had been drinking when I asked him if he had any Cervezas and nodded yes (Cerveza - Spanish for beer).I contact the Maryland State Police - Bel Air Barrack and asked for Tfc. Reckeweg (#7214) of the Maryland State Police - Bel Air Barrack to respond to the scene for spanish translation.Lainez stated that he had just drove a friend home from Looneys Pub in Baltimore County.Lainez also stated that he was looking at his phone when he got into the collision.Lainez told Tfc. Reckeweg that he had about 12 beers and a couple mixed drinks at the bar.   PHASE THREE: PRE ARREST SCREENING  I notified the Maryland State Police - Bel Air Barrack via radio that I would be conducting Standard Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) on Lainez. During the tests, Lainezwas wearing shoes, jeans, and a sweater jacket. The tests were conducted in the right travel portion of northbound Belair Road just North of Whitaker Mill Road. The roadway was blocked by emergency personnel so there was no traffic hazzard. The testing site was well lit due to overhead lighting, lighting from the across street car dealership (Jones Juntion) and emergency vehicle headlights. The testing site was flat, dry, and free of debris and obstructions. There was no precipitation in the air and the air temperature was in the 30s. There was minimal traffic during the tests due to the time and location and the roadway being shut down.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6 of 6 clues)  Tfc. Reckeweg asked Lainez if he had any medical conditions or physical disabilities that would affect any of the tests for which Lainez advised he had none.HGN was performed by Tfc. Reckeweg using his right index finger as a stimulus.The stimulus was passedhorizontally across Lainezsface at adistance of 12-15 inches and slightly above eye level. The test was explained indetail prior to Lainezattempting it.Lainezverbally confirmed that he understood the instructions. Lainezwas faced away from the roadwayas not to distract him. Emergency lights were turned off in Lainezs direction as to not distract him. Lainezwas first checked for resting nystagmus, equal pupil size, and equal tracking. Lainezdid not display resting nystagmus, and had equal pupil size and equal tracking in both left and right eyes. Lainezdisplayed lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.Lainezalso displayed vertical nystagmus. Lainezdisplayed 6 of 6 clues.  WALK AND TURN TEST (4 of 8 clues)  The test was explained and demonstrated, by Tfc. Reckeweg, in detail prior to Lainezattempting it. Lainezverbally confirmed he understood the instructions. During the test, Lainezwas to use the white shoulder line of northbound Belair Road as the line to walk along. During the walking phase,Lainez took 25 steps on his first series of 9 steps.Lainez stopped walking for 5 seconds after he took his first 25 steps.Lainez did not perform the turn properly for which he spun around on his right leg and stutter stepped after the turn.Lainez stepped off line on step 19 on his second series of 9 steps.Lainez took 30 steps on his second series of 9 steps before he was told to stop.Lainez displayed 4 of 8 clues.  ONE LEG STAND TEST (1 of 4 clues)  The test was explained and demonstrated, by Tfc. Reckeweg, in detail prior to Lainezattempting it. Lainez verbally confirmed that he understood the instructions. Lainezelected to raise his left leg during the test. During the test,Lainez swayed a back and forth motion of 2 inches and a side to side motion of 2 inches.Lainez displayed 1 of 4 clues.  Lainez was offered a PBT, and he refused the test.Lainez stated to Tfc. Reckeweg I knew he was driving and that he was under the influence.Lainez then stated why would he take the PBT if he knew it was going to be positive. (See BWC Video for further)  Due to my knowledge, training, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper,6 time MADD DUI Award recipient,6 time Harford County Council DUI award recipient, 2013/2015/2016 Maryland State Police Commanders Award (DUI) recipient, graduate of the University of Maryland DUI Institute, 4 time Impaired Driving Coalition DUI Award recipient, Advanced Roadside Intoxicated Driver Enforcement (ARIDE) graduate, a certified Intoximeter Operator, a SFST Instructor, a certified Drug Recognition Expert, as well as prior arrests and clues gathered thus far, Lainezwas placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. Lainezwas then transported to the Maryland State Police - Bel Air Barrack where he was read his DR-15 Advise of Rights in Spanish, from the MVA website by Tfc. Reckeweg. Lainezconsented to an intoximeter test. The intoximeter test was conducted by Corporal Atkinson (#0074) of the Maryland State Police - Bel Air Barrack and Lainezs breath specimen was found to contain .18 grams of alcohol per 201 liters of breath.  Lainezwas issued all appropriate paperwork and was taken to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center to be seen by medical personnel due to injuries he had incurred from the collision.Lainez was released to a caring physician.
