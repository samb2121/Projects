         <NarrativeText>In-car camera, H-28 and BWC operational,  Defendant: Talithia Desiree Scott Soundex #/STATE: S-300-785-139-858/Maryland Date of Birth: 11/08/1984 Date of Arrest: 09/27/2023 Time of Arrest: 2347 Temperature: 54 Degrees Weather Condition: Clear DUI # 23-169  Attachments:   One (1) Maryland State Police Written Statement (Form 076)  One (1) ACRS Report.    CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING    Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police.  Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E).   margin-left:8px"&gt;Admitted as an expert in Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (H.G.N) in State VS Robert Kramer on July 03, 2023 (0B70Y24).   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)    On September 27, 2023 at approximately 2306 hours, I, Tpr. Nain #7452 was on duty, operating marked Maryland State Police vehicle H-28. I was dispatched to report to a two vehicle collision at the intersection of US RT 301 and Pierce Road, Waldorf, Maryland.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  Upon my arrival to the scene, I made contact with three (3) Charles County Sheriffs Deputies who were assisting with scene security. The deputies advised it was a two vehicle collision with the possibility of the driver of the at fault vehicle being intoxicated. One of the Charles County Deputy provided the credentials of the drivers and gave a brief synopsis of the scene, as well as the information to a witness who saw the entire collision. I observed a black BMW X5 bearing Maryland temporary registration (T1495181) which was partially off the roadway and on the curb with heavy passenger side damage with airbags deployed, southbound right shoulder on US RT 301 at Pierce Road. The second vehicle was a white Audi Q7 bearing Maryland registration (9ET7116) in the middle of the roadway at US RT 301 at Pierce road with heavy front end damage with airbags deployed. I made contact with the driver of the white Audi Q7, I introduce myself to the driver and asked if he was injured to which he replied No. I asked the driver of the Audi to verify his information to which he complied. I then asked the driver to explain how the accident occurred, the driver stated, I was at US RT 301 at Pierce Road waiting for the light to change, once the light changed to green. I started to cross the intersection of US RT 301 then out of nowhere I hit the car the BMW that ran the red light. I then made contact with the driver of the black BMW X5, I introduce myself to the driver then asked if she was injured, I immediately smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath, person and observed her glassy bloodshot red eyes. The driver stated No I am not injured, just a bit shaken up. I then ask the driver to verify her credentials to which she complied. I then ask the driver how the accident occurred, the driver stated I had the green light, while I was driving across Pierce Road and the driver of the Audi ran the red light and hit me. Once I retrieved all the drivers credentials I returned to marked vehicle H-28 to print two vehicle exchange forms. The witness who was not on scene upon my arrival, gave a Charles County Sheriffs Deputy her credentials and told the Deputies that she witnessed the BMW X5 run the red light.The witness accounts of the events matched with the driver of the Audi Q7. I printed a copy of the vehicle exchange forms and gave the driver of the Audi Q7 his copy. The driver of the BMW X5 Talithia Desiree Scott (B/F, DOB: 11/08/1984) was identified by her Maryland Identification. I observed Scotts eyes to be bloodshot red and glassy. I instructed Scott to follow me back to the marked vehicle, to which she complied. Scott had difficulties keeping her balance once in front of marked H-28, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Scotts breath and person. I informed Scott that I detected the odor of alcohol on her person, I then asked Scott how much she had to drink tonight. Scott replied Nothing. I asked Scott where she was coming from, Scott replied An African restaurant in Washington DC. I asked Scott if she would be willing to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Test to which she refused. Scott stated The last time I performed the test in 2018, I got arrested for DUI and my attorney advised me not to take any test. Scott stated I am currently a special Police in Washington DC and if I submit to taking the test I would have to inform my job and I will lose my clearance. Scott asked if I saw the white lady that witnessed the accident. I informed Scott that I would be contacting the witness. (Refer to Delta for ACRS report).  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   Medical conditions or injuries which would inhibit his ability to walk in a straight line or stand on one foot: Nothing to report.  Medications: Nothing to report.  Glasses: Nothing to report  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (Refused)  WALK AND TURN (Refused)  ONE LEG STAND - (Refused)   Based on my training knowledge and experience I had reason to believe Scott was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Scott Strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person.    Scott Eyes glassy and bloodshot red with a glazed look.  Scott Running a red circular traffic signal and causing a collision.    I arrested Scott for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2347 hours. I then secured Scott in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle (H-28) and transported her to the La Plata Barrack for processing. A mouth check was conducted at 0004 hours as well as 0025 hours. Nothing was located inside his mouth. I arrived at the La Plata Barrack with Scott. After arriving at the Barrack, I gave Scott a copy of the DR-15, Advice of Rights, in English to review. I also played the English version of the DR-15 via the MVA website. After Scott reviewed the DR-15 she refused to take the intoximeter test.  Intoximeter Result: (Refused)        Trooper Schrock #7586 and Trooper First Class (TFC) Lagchu #6846 who are both currently assigned to Maryland State Police La Pata barrack remained with the vehicle until T and T towing arrived to tow the vehicle. T and T towing arrived to took possession of the vehicle.  I then made contact with the witness on September 29, 2023, at approximately 1830 hours to make arrangements to meet in person for an official written statement. I arrived at Maryland State Police Barracks at approximately 2245 hours, which is located at 9500 Mitchell road, La Plata Maryland 20646. I met with Nicolette Watkins (W/F, DOB: 09/25/1966) identified by her Maryland identification. Watkins advised that on the night of September 27, she was traveling southbound on MD RT 5 and observed the Black BMW X5 swerving over the solid white line on multiple occasions. Watkins advised I became concerned about the way the driver of the BMW was driving, so I called 911 and dispatch advised that we were almost in Charles County, so the call was then transferred to Maryland State Trooper. Watkins stated, While on the phone with Maryland State Trooper I gave our current location, description of the vehicle and describe how the driver was driving. After hanging up the phone we were approaching southbound US RT 301 at Pierce road when our light changed to red the driver of the BMW ran the red light and hit the driver of the AUDI Q7. (To see written statement refer to attachments.)         Scott was then released from the La Plata Barrack to a sober driver. All copies of the proper paperwork were completed and given to Scott for his records. Charges:   Scott was charged with the following citations. 1. Driving while under the influence of alcohol (0RB0Y24) 2.
