         <NarrativeText>DUI Folder # 23-96-174 SUSPECT: Jaquelyn Avila-Cacique LICENSE #MD/ A-142-356-017-025 DUI CITATION # 3LR0VPH SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER: No ACCIDENT INVOLVED: No VIDEO: Maryland State Police; Axon Evidence Video ID #: 23MSP022052. BWC Utilized.  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:   I am trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 80 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.   Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:  On June 19, 2023, at approximately 2326 hours, I, Tfc. Pinto #7212 was on duty, operating unmarked Maryland State Police Patrol Vehicle V-9, patrolling in the area westbound Ocean Gateway east of Golf Course Road, Ocean City, Worcester County Maryland in lane 2 and I observed a red Nissan Rogue bearing Maryland registration, 8EK1039, traveling westbound on Ocean Gateway east of Golf Course Road and pass my patrol vehicle in lane 1. I remained behind the red Nissan and I observed the vehicle cross the solid yellow line into the left turn cement divider area by approximately one (1) tires width, and drift back into lane 1. I observed the red Nissan continue westbound on Ocean Gateway east of Elm Street, cross the solid yellow line, with the drivers side tires, into the median area, by approximately one (1) tires width, and slowly drift back into lane 1. Once the red Nissan traveled to westbound Ocean Gateway at Elm Street, I observed the vehicle cross the solid yellow line into the median area, with the drivers side tires, by approximately (2) tires width, and drift back into lane 1. I remained behind the red Nissan at westbound Ocean Gateway east of Stephen Decatur Highway and I observed the vehicle cross the solid yellow line into the median area, with the drivers side tires, by approximately one (1) tires width, and weave back into lane 1. The red Nissan continued westbound on Ocean Gateway at Stephen Decatur Highway and I observed the vehicle cross the solid white line into the left turn lane, by approximately a half (1/2) of a tires width, coming within three (3) feet of side swiping dark colored dodge truck, and swerving into lane 1. I continued behind the red Nissan at westbound Ocean Gateway east of Keyser Point Road when I observed the vehicle cross the solid yellow line, into the median area, by approximately one (1) tires width, and swerve back into lane 1. The red Nissan continued to travel westbound on Ocean Gateway at Keyser Point Road and I observed the vehicle cross the solid yellow line, into the median area, by approximately one (1) tires width, and swerve back into lane 1. The red Nissan crossed the solid white line, into the left turn lane, by approximately one (1) tires width again, at westbound Ocean Gateway west of Keyser Point Road, at the median crossover. The red Nissan continued westbound on Ocean Gateway at Man O War Lane in lane 1 and I observed the vehicle cross the solid yellow line by half (1/2) the tires width, into the median area, and swerve back into lane 1. I remained behind the red Nissan at westbound Ocean Gateway east of Man O War Lane when I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the red Nissan. The red Nissan came to a stop in the right turn lane at westbound Ocean Gateway east of Grays Corner Road.   Phase 2 - Personal Contact  Upon contact with the driver of the vehicle at the front drivers side open window, I immediately detected the moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. I identified myself, and explained to the driver the reason for the traffic stop. While explaining the reason for the stop, the driver provided her license. I asked the driver for her registration. While the driver retrieved her registration, I identified the driver as Jacquelyn Avila-Cacique (W/F 01/08/2000) by her Maryland Drivers license. I asked Avila-Cacique for her registration. While Avila-Cacique retrieved her registration, I asked her if she still lived at the Salisbury address on her license and she advised she did. Avila-Cacique then handed me a copy of her insurance card to the vehicle and I asked her a second time for the registration for the red Nissan. While Avila-Cacique retrieved the registration, I asked her where she was traveling from and she stated, Ocean City. I asked the driver where in Ocean City she was traveling from and she stated, 2nd Street. I asked Avila-Cacique for the place she was traveling from on 2nd Street and when she responded her speech was slurred and I had trouble understanding her. I asked Avila-Cacique to repeat herself and she stated, Caribbean Pool bar. I asked Avila-Cacique how many alcoholic beverages she consumed before driving and she stated, Umm a couple, I dont remember. While speaking with Avila-Cacique, I observed her eyes to be glassy. I advised Avila-Cacique to continue to look for her registration card and to hold it out the window once she locates it.   I returned to my patrol vehicle, conducted routine checks on Avila-Cacique and asked for back-up for Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening    I deactivated my front emergency equipment. I approached the drivers window of the red Nissan and retrieved the registration of the red Nissan. I asked Avila-Cacique to step out of her vehicle to continue my investigation and she complied. While Avila-Cacique stepped from her vehicle I advised her I want to put her through some tests to make sure she is okay to drive. I asked Avila-Cacique to step to the front of her vehicle and she complied.   While at the front of the red Nissan, I observed Avila-Cacique to be wearing a black sweatshirt, gray yoga pants, and gray Van shoes. I also detected the moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Avila-Caciques breath and person.  I advised Avila-Cacique I was going to ask her some questions and while I did so I asked her to stand with her feet together and hands by her side and she complied. I asked Avila-Cacique how many alcoholic beverages she consumed this evening and she stated, Im not sure. I asked Avila-Cacique around about how many alcoholic beverages she consumed and she stated, Maybe three four. I asked Avila-Cacique where she consumed the alcoholic beverages and she stated, Um they were probably uh Wicomico Street. I asked Avila-Cacique whats on Wicomico Street and she stated, Crawl Bar. I asked Avila-Cacique if that is where she was currently traveling from right now and she stated, Yes right now yes. I asked Avila-Cacique what type of alcoholic beverages she consumed and she stated, They were just like um hard tea. Avila-Cacique then advised the hard tea were called Surf Sides. I asked Avila-Cacique what size the alcoholic beverages were and she advised they were a twelve ounce can. I asked Avila-Cacique what time she consumed her last alcoholic beverages, advised her it was currently 2333 hours, and she stated, Uh my last drink was um around like um maybe ten thirty. Avila-Cacique then advised she drank water since. I asked Avila-Cacique what time she started consuming alcoholic beverages and she stated, Umm maybe six thirty. I asked Avila-Cacique if she has any physical disabilities and she stated, No, other than me being like um visually impaired, I wear contacts. I asked Avila if she can see since she has her contacts in and she stated, yes. I asked Avila-Cacique if she had any physical abilities again and she stated, No. I asked Avila-Cacique if she has any medical disabilities and she stated, No. I asked Avila-Cacique if she has any recent injuries that would prevent her from walking in a straight line or standing on one leg and she stated, No no no. I asked Avila-Cacique if she was currently on any medications and she stated, No, other than Clairton. I asked Avila-Cacique if she wears contacts and she stated, Yes.

The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. was asked to stand with her feet together and hands by her side. A pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Avila-Cacique eyes, slightly above eye level. Avila-Cacique was instructed to look straight ahead at my pen and instructed to follow the pen with her eyes and eyes only. When asked if she understood the instructions, Avila-Cacique stated, Yes.

Avila-Cacique was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series.

Avila-Cacique was instructed once she began the test keeping her hands down by her sides, looking down at her feet, and to count every step out loud.
