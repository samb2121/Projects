         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera Defendant: Maurice Wenzell Williams Jr.  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,000 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On January 28, 2023 at approximately 0013 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on eastbound Eastern prior to MD 43, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a white Honda Civic bearing Maryland registration 5EY4092 traveling in front of my patrol vehicle (two vehicles in front). The Honda swerved right over the fog line with more than half the vehicles width on the right shoulder. A black SUV that was behind the Honda broke and turned flashing hazard lights on to notify other vehicles of the Honda. Other vehicles slowed to avoid the Honda as it was swerving. I went around the black SUV and observed the white Honda to swerve left onto the dotted white line and immediately right. The Honda swerved right over the fog line then left towards the dotted white line where a vehicle was traveling. The Honda continued to swerve left and right. I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the Honda.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Honda on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the only occupant in the vehicle. The driver rolled the rear window down when trying to roll down the drivers window. I explained the reason for the stop and requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. The driver immediately stated that he was on his learners and that he was drunk. He was identified by his Maryland learners permit as Maurice Wenzell Williams. While speaking with Williams, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I deliberately observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. He stated that he was a little drunk and coming from a bar he used to work at (Jimmys Famous Seafood). I returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.   I returned to the Honda and requested Williams to exit his vehicle and walk to the front. He complied and exited his vehicle. He dropped his phone. While speaking with Williams outside the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about alcohol consumption prior to driving, he stated not too much (a couple mix drinks, didnt know what kind of alcohol). I informed Williams that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed in the right turn lane.The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a black sweatshirt, jeans and black shoes (tightened them prior to walk and turn)  I asked Williams the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  Glasses Medication  No Head Injuries  No Problems with knees or ankles  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus   Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  There was a pick-up order for his registration plates  no insurance. When asked if he had vehicle insurance he stated that he did not.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Williams stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage:    Lost balance, stepped completely offline to the right and left.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 2 and 3.  Stepped completely offline on step 5.  Turn: Spun left both feet. Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Stopped to regain balance on step 6.  Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on step 10.   Stepped completely offline by more than a shoe width on step 11.  Took 11 steps when instructed to take 9.   ONE LEG STAND (4/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Williams stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. -Right foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Right foot hit the ground multiple times.  Seconds 11-20:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from side for balance.      Left hand on ground to maintain balance.  Seconds 21-30:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from side for balance.   Hopped on left foot.   PBT #209455 with a result of .09 BrAC.  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Williams was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0032 hours, I placed Williams under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Williams with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. At 0118 hours, Williams agreed to take a breath test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Williams beginning at 0052 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Williams was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by TFC Jackson of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Williams had a result of .15 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0126 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****.15 grams of alcohol****  Williams was polite and cooperative. He was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.    </NarrativeText>
