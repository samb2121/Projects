PROPERTY SEIZED (vehicle):  Item 1: One black BLU Products, Model: S91 phone with black case.  PROPERTY OWNER/ACCUSED:   Borunda, Luis Esteban (W/M, DOB: 8/27/1958)  Narrative:  On August 22, 2023, United States Army Special Agent Kyle Hannum (hereby referred to as UCA) was conducting undercover investigations to identify suspects involved in the on-line sexual exploitation of children. On this date, UCA operates as a 13-year-old girl, Chloe on a social networking application called Chatib.us when he was solicited for sexual acts by an unknown individual identified as Steve.  Initial contact with Steve was established using Chatib app at approximately 1512 hours. Steve initiated contact with Chloe on the Chatib app and immediately asked do u msg older men? Steve then said, how young are u? I like very young girls so please dont hate me. Chloe responded, im 13 lol. I dont hate you. Steve replied, I love 13, I met 15 yo girls b4 but never 13, do u think you would want to meet? Steve also said that he was 49 and added, it would be hot and naughty to meet her.  Steve wanted to meet up and asked if Chloe had Snap which Chloe said she did not, Steve asked, how can we plan? Chloe asked what about discord? Steve provided Chloe with his discord username guyinmd. Steve sent Chloe messages via Discord to continue chatting.   While messaging through Discord, Steve stated, I like that u seem mature for ur age. Chloe answered Thanks that makes me feel good! and Steve stated, Wait until you feel how good my tongue feels in ur pussy hehe Im sorry Im so bad. Steve told Chloe I want u to get wet when I talk to u. Its ok and normal, It shows me that u like me, I want ur pussy to want me too. During the conversation, Steve advised he generally works in DC as a consultant who works with people from other countries that want to do business in the US. Chloe asked Steve Oh wow that sounds cool! Do you wear a suit? Steve stated Lol yes, But when we meet I wont be wearing one lol.   On August 23, 2023, Steve advised he wanted to meet Chloe and mentioned the possibility of meeting at a park near the CVS in Severn, MD. Steve sent Chloe a filtered black and white picture of himself. During the conversation, they agreed to meet on Wednesday, August 30, 2023 at 10am. Steve then asked Chloe if she drank coffee. Chloe replied, I only drink the really girly ones haha. I like the mocha frappes from Starbucks the best! Steve offered a brownie as well.  Steve asked Chloe what outfit she might be wearing the day that they meet up and she sent him a picture of a multicolored shirt and jeans.  On August 27, 2023, Steve asked Chloe, Hey, we should game plan a little bit ok? What time should I pick u up? I looked at the area a little bit an I have some suggestions. Chloe stated, Hmmm, I think 10 is okay. Ill be awake and be able to walk to the park by then. Steve asked for the name of the park and Chloe stated, Province park is the one your talking about right? Steve confirmed that was the park and they talked about the baseball field to meet up and have a back-up plan. Steve also said to Chloe what he wanted to do the day they met up. Chloe, just so that we understand each other ... Im looking at Wednesday as a get to know each other day.. maybe kissing and getting to know what you like sexually... I am not going into this to fuck... At least not on Wednesday haha... So I dont want u to feel pressure... Just know that ur going to feel very good...  On August 29, 2023, Steve told Chloe if there were a lot of cars in the parking lot to meet at the orange jungle gym. Steve also said he might Uber to the park or he has a black Chevy Sedan.  On August 30, 2023, at approximately 0930 hours, undercover Special Agents with the Army-CID, Naval Criminal Investigations Services (NCIS) and the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit (MSP CCU) were posted inside and in the area of the Province Park awaiting Steves arrival to meet with Chloe who would be an undercover NCIS Special Agent.  While conducting surveillance, of the CVS parking lot, Sgt Cooper (MSP) noticed a black Chevy Impala with MD registration 3ET3854, sitting in the parking lot directly next to his vehicle. The subject in the vehicle had dark hair and glasses, there was also a suit hanging up in the back seat. Sgt Cooper maintained surveillance on the subject who appeared to be texting on his phone. At this time, Steve was still communicating with Chloe. Sgt. Cooper watched the individual exit his vehicle carrying a green object and began to walk on foot towards the park with a green object in his left hand and a bottle of liquid in his right hand. At this time, Steve told Chloe that he was close and asked her to walk towards the orange jungle gym. When this message was sent, the unidentified subject was still on foot in the area of the park. The undercover female officer then walked towards the orange jungle gym. Sgt. Cooper then watched as the subject returned shortly thereafter and got back into the black Impala. The subject then proceeded to drive past the park several times before turning in, which was observed by other undercover officers. At the same time, Steve asked Chloe if she was okay since there were police near the park. Sgt Cooper noted that Fort Meade officers had stopped a vehicle just up from the park on Disney Road.  Surveillance officers watched the black Impala pull into the parks parking lot before pulling back out. The black Impala drove by no less than 4 times. Steve then told Chloe that he was leaving because he was getting nervous with all of the police around. He told Chloe to go home and text him when she was safe. Chloe started walking home towards the CVS and observed the black Impala slow down and drive pass her. The black Impala turned around in the CVS parking lot and circled passed Chloe again who was walking on the sidewalk along Disney Road. At this time, TFC Burnett was following Chloe and observed the black Impala slow up beside Chloe and then pulled back in to the CVS parking lot. Chloe then crossed the street and the black Impala pulled into a parking spot. Investigators then made the decision to stop and arrest the driver. Investigators converged on the black Impala as it was attempting to leave. The driver was placed under arrest for Sexual Solicitation of a Minor without incident. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Luis Esteban Borunda, 8/27/1958, with an Essex, Maryland address. A black Samsung Galaxy S8 cellphone, IMEI: 355987081003583 with black phone case was recovered from Borundas right pants pocket.   Borunda was transported to the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for further processing. Borunda was held in the Barracks prisoner cell. Borunda denied talking to any investigators.   The Chevrolet Impala was seized from the CVS parking lot and towed to the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for a search warrant to be authored.  TFC Burnett authored a search warrant for the black Chevrolet Impala bearing Maryland registration 3ET3854, and a search warrant for the black Samsung Galaxy S8 cellphone, IMEI: 355987081003583 with black phone case. These were signed by the Honorable Judge Asti with the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court.     At approximately 1515 hours, investigators searched the Impala and recovered a black BLU Products cellphone, Model: S91 Pro from underneath the drivers seat. May it be noted that Discord was the main source of communication between Steve and Chloe. Investigators observed numerous Discord notifications on the front screen of the phone. Previously, SA Hannum sent a message to the Discord user guyinmd (Steve) which coordinated with the notifications on the phone. Also, investigators located condoms hidden in the center console underneath of the bottoms cover. There was also a lime green microfiber rag and water bottle sitting on the front passenger seat. A lime green insulated bottle with coffee sitting in the center cup holder. In the trunk there was a black bag with miscellaneous sex toys, cleansing wipes, lubricant and a paper towel. There were also opened, and unopened bottles of alcohol in the trunk. Borunda signed the Maryland State Police Search Warrant Inventory Report and Return (Form 98) and the vehicle was released back to Borunda.   Cpl. Heid and TFC Burnett transported Borunda to the Anne Arundel Detention Center, where he was placed into the jails custody with all of his appropriate paperwork. At this time, a new updated tracking number was issued for Borundas charges by the jail. Sgt. Cooper took possession of both of the phones and transported them to the Maryland State Police Forensics Lab and delivered to DFE Casey for further examination.   On August 31, 2023, TFC Burnett authored a search warrant for the black BLU Products cellphone, Model: S91 Pro, which was signed by the Honorable Judge Asti with the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court. TFC Burnett also sent Judge Asti the Maryland State Police Search Warrant Inventory Report and Return (Form 98) for the vehicle and the Maryland State Police Evidence Inventory (Form 98A) for the vehicle to be signed.  On September 1, 2023, S/A Hannum resubmitted an updated preservation letter for the creation to current date of the Discord account guyinmd#1658 to Discord.     On September 5, 2023, TFC Burnett authored a search warrant for the Discord account guyinmd#1658 which was signed by the Honorable Judge Celeste with the Anne Arundel Circuit Court. The signed search warrant was submitted to Discord through the portal with the reference #DISC-3876. The Computer Crimes Unit received a phone call from an Erick Oribio who advised he saw the news and had very important information for the case. Oribio explained that he has worked with Borunda for years and would like to tell someone what he knows. Oribio requested a Spanish-speaking Officer to assist him in the interview, which will be scheduled at a later date.  Also, I received an email from Detective Swope with the Washington County Sheriffs Office, advising that their agency possibly conducted an undercover operation between August 21-25, 2023 with Borunda. I contacted Det. Swope by phone and she advised her agency observed the altered photograph of Borunda that he sent to Chloe and recognized it from their undercover chatting operation with Borunda. Det. Swope provided their undercover agents Snapchat username Matty Malone and Jackie Remy.  Case closed by adult arrest, but pending further investigation.</NarrativeText>

At approximately 02:38 into the video, a male appears to be Luis Borunda (based upon his Maryland drivers license photograph, and other smartphone pictures) is observed performing cunnilingus on the female. The bed sheets and comforter are white and appear to be consistent with a hotel setting.     The phone number for Wendy Campbell is (760-265-8736), which returns to the area of Victorville, CA. Through an open-source database, the phone number is registered through Metro PCS and returns to Latesh Campbell.    On 9/7/2023, DFE Casey provided the below flight information that was located in Borundas calendar of his Galaxy S8 phone, it did not provide carrier.      -7/18/2023 flight #0495, confirmation#31VEWB      -8/15/23 flight #1180      -The phone was used to connect to the Southwest Airlines WiFi on both 7/18/2023 and 8/15/2023  On 9/8/2023, Cpl. Heid contacted me by phone advising that D/Sgt. Zeller received a phone call from a family member who wished to stay anonymous, advising that they observed child pornography on Borundas laptop. Cpl. Heid explained that a couple investigators were going to the residence with a search warrant to seize the devices (see Cpl. Heids supplement for further details).    On 9/11/2023, S/A Hannum was assisting in trying to identify the Wendy Campbell subject with facial recognition. She is identified as Wendy Aisha Campbell (DOB: 10/9/2007) (15 yoa), mothers address:16555 San Juan Pl, Victorville, CA 92395. Below is additional information:      -It appears Wendy lives with her Mother Latesha Franklin in California, but she has also recently lived in AZ with her guardian (Grandfather) Lee Franklin.      -Wendy was the victim of another online solicitation in Arizona in April 2023 (See attached D-Dex 2023 Incident) I reached out to the Arizona Police department that handled the investigation to obtain additional information. I am currently awaiting a call back.      -It appears Wendy Campbell andBorundahave probably met before. He mentioned in one of the messages that he wanted to do the same thing as last time. And he referred to being at the apartment where he dropped her previously.  Within the report from the Maricopa County Sheriffs Office in Arizona, on 4/20/2023, Wendy Campbell was caught during school chatting to an adult male online. She advised she met him through Chatib.com and started chatting further through a Word document that they could both edit. Wendy advised that she did send them a couple inappropriate pictures of herself, and they also sent her a picture of his penis. Wendys guardians (Lee Franklin and Shirley Jacobs) came to pick Wendy up from school. On 4/28/2023, contact with Shirley revealed Wendy went back to her mother, Leticia Campbell (Shirleys niece) on 4/22/2023 in Victorville, CA. Wendy attends the Silverado High School. It was made known by Shirley that Leticia is deaf and would not communicate very well.

         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS:    - One image of suspect on foot walking towards park  NARRATIVE:    On 8/30/2023, I was requested to assist the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit with surveillance related to an investigation into sexual solicitation of a minor. I was briefed on the facts of the case and informed that the suspect had agreed to meet with what he believed to be a 13-year-old female in the Provinces Park in Anne Arundel County. The park is located at 1742 Disney Road, Severn, MD. The suspect had indicted that he was aware of the undercover profiles age of 13, and he voiced his intent to engage in sexual acts with her.    I was provided with a selfie picture that the suspect had sent to the undercover account and that the suspect had stated that he would likely be driving a black Chevrolet sedan to the park and that he had offered to bring a Starbucks coffee. A review of the picture sent by the suspect indicated that the picture had several filters applied to it to make the subject look younger and have facial hair. In looking at the edges of the face I could see gray salt and pepper style hair on the side of the subjects head and the skin on the subjects neck looked darker and more wrinkled than the rest of the face where the filters were applied. Additionally, I noted that the subject in the picture had black framed glasses.    At approximately 0845 hours, I responded to the area of the park in my unmarked car CE-79. I checked the area for black Chevrolet sedans with no results prior to setting up a surveillance position at the CVS Pharmacy located at 2600 Annapolis Road, Severn, MD. The CVS was located at the corner of MD-175 and Disney Road in the travel path between the Provinces Park and the nearest Starbucks. The CVS is approximately .3 miles from the Provinces Park entrance. I parked in the CVS parking lot along the side of the building facing Disney Road at approximately 0850 hours and began to watch the parking lot and Disney Road to keep and eye out for anyone matching the suspect description or vehicle description.    Shortly before 0930 hours, I observed a black newer model Chevrolet Impala approach the CVS on Disney Road from MD-175 and pull into the CVS lot on the side facing MD-175. I did not see anyone get out of the vehicle on foot and the vehicle remained on the lot for several minutes. The vehicle then proceeded to move positions to the side parking lot facing Disney Road and park two spaces away from my vehicle. I could see that a suit with a white shirt was hanging in the back window behind the drivers seat. I observed a Hispanic male that appeared to be in his 60s in the drivers seat. He appeared to be alone in the vehicle. The subject sat parked in the vehicle for an extended period of time and appeared to be looking down in his lap as if he was typing on or using a mobile device. I noted that he had gray and black salt and pepper hair and was wearing black framed glasses that were very similar to the glasses in the picture sent to the undercover account by the suspect. At one point the subject got out of the vehicle and accessed the trunk of the impala. I observed a green aluminum bottle in the cup holder and that he was wearing a black t-shirt and khaki colored pants. He again entered the drivers seat without entering the CVS and appeared to using a phone looking down at his lap. At one point he placed sunglasses on while seated in the vehicle.    At approximately 1006 hours Agent Hannum advised that he had just told the suspect that he (the undercover profile) had arrived in the park. Almost simultaneously, I heard the subject start the Impala and then he pulled out of the parking spot. The car slowly circled the CVS lot and then pulled out of the lot onto eastbound MD-175.     At approximately 1016 hours, I was still in the same stationary position when I observed the driver of the Impala walking from the front side of the CVS parking lot on foot towards my location. He was carrying a clear plastic water bottle in his right hand and what appeared to be a cylindrical object in a green bag in his left hand. I observed him walk through the parking lot behind my vehicle and then out of the lot onto Disney Road headed in the direction of the park. Several minutes passed, and I heard a police siren going off. I then observed a Fort Meade Military Police Officer initiate a traffic stop at the intersection of MD-175 and Disney Road.    At approximately 1022 hours, I was notified that the suspect had informed the under cover account that he was at the park. This was consistent with the amount of time it would have taken for the subject I saw on foot to have walked to the park. I then proceeded to leave my stationary position to get closer to the park. As I drove down Disney Road towards the park I observed the driver of the Impala that had walked past me earlier walking back towards the CVS. As I drove past him, he looked hard at my patrol vehicle. In order to not continue being seen by the subject, I proceeded down Disney Road and parked a distance away in a neighborhood. Other members of the surveillance team remained in the CVS parking lot and other positions with vantage points on the park.    For approximately the next 30-40 minutes the surveillance team observed the driver of the Impala, later identified as Luis Borunda, circle the park multiple times as well as having pulled into the park several times. At approximately 1100 hours, Borunda was followed back to the CVS parking lot where he was stopped in his vehicle and taken into custody. A black Samsung smartphone was seized from his person at the time of his arrest pending a search warrant being obtained to search the phone.    Borundas Impala was seized and secured pending a search warrant being executed on the vehicle. I remained with the vehicle and the Glen Burnie barrack was contacted and sent a tow for the vehicle to be taken back to the barrack. TTS towing responded and towed the vehicle from the CVS to the barrack. I remained with the vehicle and followed it back to the barrack.    TFC. Burnett authored and obtained a search warrant for the vehicle on 8/30/2023. At approximately 1515 hours, TFC. Burnett, Agent Hannum and I executed the search warrant on Borundas Impala. While searching the vehicle, I located a black Blu Products smartphone in a black case under the drivers seat of the vehicle. The phone was retrieved from under the seat and when the phone was picked up the screen illuminated indicating that it was powered on. I noted that on the screen were multiple Discord notifications. It should be noted that Agent Hannum was utilizing Discord to communicate with the suspect throughout the day. Also located in the vehicle were condoms, personal lubricant and vibrating penis rings. See TFC. Burnetts report for further details regarding the search of the vehicle.     After the search of the Impala was completed, I took possession of both of Borundas cell phones and transported them to the Maryland State Police Digital Forensics lab for processing pending search warrants being obtained. This concluded my involvement in the investigation on 8/30/2023.   ALL OF THE ABOVE EVENTS DID OCCUR IN ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, MARYLAND  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>ACTION TAKEN:   On Friday September 8, 2023, D/Sgt B. Zeller was contacted by a family member of Sharon Borunda. The family member, who asked to remain anonymous, advised D/Sgt Zeller that they were requested by Sharon Borunda, to try and remove her husbands Facebook page as it contained photos of her grandchildren. Apparently since her husbands arrest, several members of the public have been taking screen shots of some of his photos that include her grandchildren.   The family member went on to say that they logged on to Luis Borundas laptop computer which was already on in Sharons bedroom. While attempting to access his Facebook page, they discovered an image of a female child that was nude. The child was clearly underage and was exposing her vagina. The family member immediately stopped and called D/Sgt Zeller and asked him to come remove the laptop.   D/Sgt Zeller contacted Cpl. C. Heid and asked for assistance. Cpl. Heid called Sharon Borunda and asked her about the details of the potential child pornography. Sharon reiterated what the family member had told D/Sgt Zeller. Sharon stated that she would give MSP consent to come and remove the property. Sharon stated that there was also a cell phone and thumb drives as well. Sharon told Cpl. Heid that these items are Luis and she does not use them. A decision was made at that time to prepare a residential search warrant. Cpl. Heid informed Sharon Borunda that a search warrant was applied for and that troopers would be coming by to contact her.   Sgt M. Pitcher authored the residential search warrant which was later signed by the Honorable Judge Kevin Wiggins of the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County. On September 8, 2023, at approximately 2358 hours, the search warrant was executed at Sharon Borundas home at 903 Lance Avenue, Essex, MD, 21221. Ms. Borunda led investigators to her bedroom where she stated Luis kept all of his electronic devices. Ms. Borunda stated that Luis pass code is usually 2620. Investigators seized an HP laptop, a Western Digital hard drive, a Samsung cell phone, and four flash drives. Ms. Borunda was provided with a search warrant inventory return as well as a copy of the search warrant. The seized items were packaged per MSP policy and transported to MSP CED Headquarters.   On September 11, 2023, Cpl. Heid met with Sharon Borunda, and her daughter, Macie Borunda at the Baltimore County Child Advocacy Center, for a scheduled forensic interview. Prior to meeting, Sharon Borunda contacted Cpl. Heid and advised that she had some additional electronic devices of Luis that she wanted to turn over. The forensic interview was conducted by Ms. Micehlle Delovich. During the interview, Macie made no disclosures about any potential abuse from Luis Borunda.   After the interview, Cpl. Heid spoke briefly with Sharon Borunda. Cpl. Heid showed Sharon photos of girls underwear that were located on one of Luis devices. Sharon stated that the pink underwear with orange piping and the blue underwear with white piping appeared to belong to Macie. Ms. Borunda was going to check Macies clothing at a later time. Sharon Borunda turned over an HP laptop, a black Seagate hard drive, a white Seagate hard drive, and two SECU ATM cards in Luis name. She stated that she located these items while cleaning out her home for a potential sale. Cpl. Heid packaged the items per MSP policy and transported them to MSP Golden Ring Barrack where they were placed in the property room. On September 12, 2023, Cpl. Heid retrieved the items from MSP Golden Ring and transported the property to CED Headquarters. The items were then placed into the temporary storage locker for TFC Burnett.

On 11/7/2023, SA DiAntonio (HSI), SA Hannum (Army CID), and I, TFC Burnett traveled to Victorville, California to interview Wendy Campbell and photograph the hotel room where the video of Wendy Campbell and Luis Borunda was recorded. SA DiAntonio made contact with Wendys parents and requested an interview of Wendy on 11/8/2023.   On 11/8/2023, SA DiAntonio, SA Hannum and TFC Burnett visited the Comfort Suites Inn in Victorville, CA and met with the manager. Pursuant to an HSI summons, the Comfort Inn provided video footage from Borundas two visits to their hotel on July 27, 2023, and August 12, 2023. The manager also allowed us to access Room # 329, where Borunda stayed during the creation of the production video. We took several photographs of the room, and it was observed to be identical to the production video.  At approximately 1530 hours, we made contact with the forensic interviewer, Brenda, victims assistant, and the ALS translator (for the parents) at the Victorville Sheriffs Office to go over the case details. At approximately 1630 hours, we made contact with Wendy, her sister, and her mother, Lateisha Campbell and step-father, Greg Campbell. After introductions, Brenda took Wendy into the interview room, which was audibly and visually recorded and started the interview at approximately 1703 hours.  During the interview, Wendy expressed some personal family issues, which are mentioned throughout the interview. Wendy advised that Greg is her step father but she refers him as her dad. Her mother had an affair which led to her birth, but her dad (stepfather) is the one who has raised her.   Wendys advised that her mother gave her up when she was 4 years old and sent her to live with her grandfather (Franklin) and great aunt (Shirley) in Arizona. Wendy explained she recently was getting into trouble and sneaking out, so she was sent back to live with her mother. Wendy didnt like living there because her great aunt would whoop her. Wendys grandfather had asked the police to see what kind of hitting was allowed because you can only hit your children in certain areas and explained to her that you just couldnt hit a persons back and head. Wendys great aunt would get mad and call her boy crazy, money crazy and a liar. Her great aunt spoke poorly of Wendys parents. Wendys brothers and sister stayed with the family when she moved because they werent bad children. The entire family had to live with the grandparents at some point because of money issues but she wasnt living with them at the time.   Wendy has been living back in Victorville, California for approximately 4 to 6 months because her great aunt kicked her out. Wendy stated she currently sleeps on the floor or outside because their apartment has bugs. Wendy is also trying to learn sign language because her mother and stepfather are deaf. Wendy had never worried about money before but her parents do not have much. Wendy is happy in Victorville because her parents dont whoop the children and they arent disrespectful to her.  Wendy stated she likes taking pictures and posting them to Instagram. Wendy stated she has been talking to adults for a long time, even when she was living in Ariznona. Wendy stated that everyone tells her that its dangerous, but she would tell adults I dont want to send nudes and they would understand and just talk to her. Wendy was meeting people on Snapchat, chatIB, and antichat.   Wendy stated there have been adults that she has met in real life but stated that they didnt do anything sexual. Typically, they would go to Starbucks and/or something similar, but then her parents caught her.  Wendy stated that there are a lot of perverts and a lot of horny men that would ask for nudes. Wendy would tell them she didnt want to and that was okay with them. There was one guy on chat IB or antichat, months ago, that she met with. They were talking as friends and then met in real life and went for something to eat. Wendy stated that although it was an adult and child hanging out, they werent doing anything sexual. This encounter happened when she was in California.   Wendy used to have chatIB and antichat in Arizona but didnt have a phone. In high school she could bring her Chromebook home and stay up all night on anonymous chat apps talking to people. Once she moved to California she met him on antichat (the person she described as meeting with in person). This male is Hispanic, has a girlfriend, and is a truck driver. Wendy stated they have met a couple times and go to Starbucks and hang out in the car or go to the park. This male lives approximately 40 minutes from her. Sometimes, Wendy would go to his apartment and watch movies. Wendy believes he is 28, or just turned 29 and thinks he was born in October. Wendy told him she was 15 turning 16. They are not hanging out anymore and he lost his apartment recently. Wendy stated they still talk but they havent hung out. This male and his girlfriend now live in his truck. The last time she saw him was last month and they went to a chicken place. This male just wanted to be friends. At first, he liked her, but she told him she just wanted to be friends. Sometimes he flirted but Wendy stated that he knows they cant do anything sexual because he could go to jail. Wendy referred to this offender as Oscar.   One time Wendys parents gave her an 8:50 pm curfew but caught her at one point meeting up with someone. Wendy stated she couldnt remember the males name, but he lived in downtown Los Angeles. Wendy went to McDonalds with him and hung out in his car and played games on the phone. Wendys phone was on silent, and she looked at it at one point and there was a lot of notifications from her mom, stepdad and sister. Her sister knew she was hanging out with an adult. She forgot to text her sister to say she was okay, and her sister got scared and told her parents. She told them she didnt do anything sexual.   Wendy stated she was excited to have freedom, a cell phone and eventually took it overboard. There are a lot of text messages with her and boys in her phone, but some of the boys are her age too.Wendy advised other adults wanted to meet up in real life, but she didnt do it. The chat sites are full of perverts, and she gets a gut feeling and decides who to meet based on their intentions. Some men dont even say hi and would start with hi baby, where do you live and ask to meet up. If people call her baby and ask for nudes without saying hi, she says no. She has spoken to a lot of adults, but she is always honest about her age.  When asked about the guy in Maryland, Wendy stated I know him. Sadly, I havent spoken to him in a while. Wendy stated they went to Starbucks and got coffee and hung out. Wendy met him on ChatIB and he wanted to keep on talking so they exchanged Snapchat accounts. Wendy stated he called himself Steve (which is the same name he used with the undercover Agent he spoke with that initiated this investigation). Steve said he had spoken to teens when he was younger. Steve was talking to a lot of girls, and they would talk and make him feel nice and then they would block him.   Wendy told him that she is a minor and they could both get in trouble. Wendy told him to give her $100 and after they went to Starbucks and started talking, he wanted to give her more money. Wendy charged him $100 to hang out. Wendy said Steve only wanted her to hang out because hes lonely and wanted to have a good time. Steve lives in Maryland, and he was coming to California to visit his mom and uncle for business. He works in government and has a son tha lives in California. Steve and his wife were planning on moving Australia or Alaska. Steves mother doesnt live in Victorville, but she lives in California.   Wendy believes Steve said he was 50 years old but stated that hes probably older than that. Steve knew she was 15 but he decided he had feelings for her. Wendy stated he was like 50 or 60, so no. She told him they could only be friends. When they were hanging out, he was asking too many questions about her family. Thats why he apologized in the Snapchat conversation. He would ask her about how school was and what she was wearing to school, and she would send him selfies of her outfits. She hasnt talked to him in a couple of months.   Wendy stated she saw him twice. They went to Starbucks again and it was around breakfast time. They went to Starbucks and Walgreens and got a place to stay but didnt do anything sexual. Steve was in one bed and Wendy was in another. Steve paid Wendy in cash and she made him pay her before they hung out. He picked her up at her house, gave her the money and they went out.   When Wendy was asked if she had texted Borunda afterwards, she advised she lost her phone and didnt have his number. But then Wendy stated after she got a new phone and internet, she did message him at one point but he did not respond to her.Wendy was then shown a series of images, a copy of which is maintained with the case file. The numbering system was done by the forensic interviewer while in the interview and in some cases, numbers are skipped. There are not images that correspond to the missing numbers.  Image 1- Borundas face using a filter.  Wendy was shown Borundas is filtered image, to which Wendy responded that is the picture. This is the same guy. Wendy stated that picture was the Maryland guy but its not exactly him. Wendy doesnt want to hang around with people that if she doesnt know what they look like. Steve asked if it was okay if he used a filter and he sent a picture the day before she was supposed to meet him. He wanted to use a filter because shes a teenager and hes an adult and could get in trouble. Wendy stated he looks older than that picture in real life, but he does have glasses. Wendy stated Steve isnt that good-looking.   Image 2- An image of the hotel lobby with Borunda and Wendy present.   When shown image 2, Wendy stated that is me and that is him. Wendy went on to explain this was at night and she had told her parents she would be with her friend and was going to spend the night. Wendy told Steve she had to be back by 8:50 but he wanted to hang out more, so she told her parents she was hanging out with a friend and Steve got a hotel. Wendy stated the first and second picture are the same guy (image 1 and image 2). Wendy reiterated that they were on separate beds and were talking. Steve told her about his past and she told him about her past.   Image 3- Two images from the hotel room.  Wendy described the room and pointed out Steves glasses. Wendy pointed to where Steve put his suitcase and also pointed out where the couch would have been located in the room (the couch was not visible in the image). When asked to talk about the video that was taken in this hotel room, Wendy stated I dont really know. Wendy explained they were using their phones a lot and she did take a picture.   Image 4- An image of Borunda taken from the production video. Borundas face is visible from the top of his head to the tip of his nose but the image was cropped as it the entire frame would have shown Borunda providing oral sex to Wendy.   Wendy explained that this image is what Steve looks like and explained they werent really doing anything. Wendy stated they were in the same bed and Steve was laying on her stomach. Steve was just laying down and getting comfortable and Wendy took a picture.  Image 6- An image showing a leg and facing toward Borundas laptop and the hotel TV screen, which is displaying the activity on the bed.  Wendy stated this is her and that Steve is laying down on her because he was a little tired. Wendy stated she had shorts on and thats why her leg is there and Steve likes to videotape himself. Steve connected his computer to the tv so he could have a bigger screen because he liked to see himself. Steve has his shirt on but then he took his pants off. Wendy told him she didnt want to do anything sexual, but he was hot and asked if he could take his pants off. Wendy tried not to look. Steve said he was fine with her not doing anything sexual. Steve was not a rapist and told her they didnt need to do anything sexual, and he would take her home whenever she wanted to go. The hotel room wasnt far from where she lived, maybe 15-20 minutes. Steve didnt force her to do anything.  Image 7 and 8- Images of Wendy. Image 7 is an image of Wendy laying on a pillow and was taken from the production video. Image 8 is Wendys profile picture.  To image 8, Wendy stated this is me. To image 7, Wendy stated that it was also her and explained that Steve liked to video himself, so she took a video of herself too laying on the bed. The video was taken with the phone.   Image 9- An image of Borundas hand with his wedding ring visible, on Wendys thigh.  Wendy responded, oh my god, you have this picture. I have a picture just like that. Wendy explained she was wearing short shorts and Steve didnt put his dick inside of me. Steve would touch her thighs. Wendy pointed to his wedding band and stated that that was his ring. Steve told her when he has sex, he cant cum or get someone pregnant.   Image 11- An image of the stairway at hotel at the hotel with both Borunda and Wendy visible.   Wendy stated she does remember. The first picture (image 2) was when they walked into the hotel. Wendy stated they stayed there for a couple hours and then they went out of the hotel room. The image is showing the back way to where Steve parked his car. They went the back way because she told him it was time for her to leave so they went to the car, and he drive her home.   Wendy had told her parents she was at a friends so they waited until 1 am and she got dressed and went to the hotel room. They were at the hotel for approximately 3 hours but told her parents she would be home by 5-6 so they left again.   The second time Wendy saw Steve he said he wasnt actually 50, he was 59. It was the day before she started school. The second time they went to the hotel, the bedroom only had one bed. They were both tired, so they went to sleep. Steve was snoring. Wendy stated she doesnt have a bed to sleep on at home, she sleeps on the floor or a couch so they both slept on the bed. Steve had to go to work or something and needed to video call his job. Even though he was away from his state he had to work.   The last time Steve gave Wendy money was the last time she spoke to him. Wendy told him she started school in the morning, and she said she needed to leave to go home to get ready. Steve gave her $50 and told her she deserved it, and he wanted her to have clothes and school supplies, so she took it.   Wendy stated she talked to him after that but never saw him again. Thats when he asked her about her school outfits.   Steve had told her that he was talking to a girl once who was 15 and it was years ago when he was in his 20s. He was friends with this girl, and she made him feel good and then she blocked him. Wendy thinks he met up with this girl. Wendy didnt want to be like the girls who are nice to him and then block him.   Wendy stated Steve didnt want her to send any pictures. Wendy told him she wasnt a horny girl and doesnt send nude images. Steve never asked for nude images, but he did like to see her outfits. He never sent her any nude images either.Wendy stated she charges people to hang out with her. On chatIB, she tells people they would have to pay money to hang out with her because they know shes a minor.   When confronted with the production video from the hotel room, Wendy stated she didnt want to tell, Yes I lied, its illegal. Wendy stated she didnt want them to get in trouble and she didnt want to get in trouble. Wendy said its fun to hang out with them and I felt like I would get in trouble because Im having sex with an adult and hes having sex with a minor.   Wendy stated her sister and brother know she talks to adults. They see her on her phone but shes always texting a teenager. Wendys parents found out she was supposed to be sleeping at a friends house, but she wasnt at her friends, and she was with an adult. They have never caught her in person though. They ask if shes safe and if shes been raped.   The interview concluded and SA DiAntonio and Victim Assistance Specialist Brenda Flores went to speak with Wendys parents.  The following is an excerpt from Army CID Special Agent Kyle Hannum, who spoke with Wendy directly following her interview.   About 1910 hours, as the child forensic interview concluded, SA Hannum asked Wendy to describe what happened during the first time she was with Steve at the hotel. Wendy stated the same thing we had sex. SA Hannum asked Wendy to explain what she meant by sex, and she stated, he ate me out and fingered me. Wendy stated, his dick never went inside of me and he had a small dick anyway She stated Steve was more interested in pleasuring her and making me feel good. Wendy later stated she only had sex with Steve during the second stay in the hotel. Wendy stated the first time she stayed with Steve in the hotel he only touched me all over. Wendy physically moved her hands all over her body to give a visual representation. Wendy stated she couldnt remember the exact dates she was at the hotel with Steve but stated in was weeks apart SA Hannum explained the CCTV footage showed Borunda and Wendy arrived and left the hotel twice in one night during the second hotel stay and asked Wendy if Steve had sex with her on both occasions that night. Wendy stated, I know what youre talking about now and stated she remembers going to the hotel with Steve twice on the same night but stated he only cuddled me and touched me the first time and he ate me out and fingered me the second time. Wendy stated Steve asked her if it was okay if he recorded the incident because he liked recording himself and wanted to watch it later. Wendy stated she thought it was weird but agreed to it.    On 12/22/2023, the Honorable Judge Asti with the Anne Arundel Circuit Court signed theMaryland State Police Search Warrant Inventory Report and Return (Form 98) for the 2 phones search warrants.  Due to the extent of the investigation, this has been transferred to HSI Agent DiAntonio for federal charges.</NarrativeText>
