         <NarrativeText>MSP marked vehicle G-40is equipped with a mobile recording device, and was recording at the time of the incident. My department issued BWC was operational and recording as well.  Defendant: Darryl Kevin Hargrove (1M DOB 12/20/1964) Date of Birth:12/20/1964 Date of Arrest: 02/27/2023 Time of Arrest: 0916 hours DUI #: 23-031   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impairment Detection Enforcement through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 02/27/2023 at approximately 0752 hours, I, TFC. B. Reilly #6751, responded to the area of westbound MD 26 west of Johnsville Road, Sykesville,Carroll County, MD for the report of a disabled vehicle that struck a curb. Westminster Barrack dispatch also advised that the disabled vehicle involved was a vehicle in question that Westminster Barrack received a couple calls about that was swerving and driving on the wrong wide of the road. Westminster Barrack received those calls at 0739 hours and 0745 hours.    I arrived on scene to find a disabled orange Dodge Journey SUV bearing MD registration1BB0368. The vehicle was parked in lane 2 on the travel portion of westbound MD 26 west of Johnsville Road.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)    I immediately made contact with the driver of the vehicle. I attempted to have a conversation with the driver and asked if he was okay. The driver stated Im good then continued to look straight ahead and was not answering questions. Due to my training, knowledge and experience of many contacts with public, this was not normal behavior nor conversation. His body also appeared stiff and had a a thousand yard stare after he responded to my question. Deputies on scene prior to my arrival stated that they spoke with the driver, and the driver stated that he was suffering a diabetic emergency. Shortly after, EMS personnel arrived on scene and asked myself and the Deputies questions in regard to the collision and the driver. After EMS personnel assessed his diabetes and blood sugar levels, they indicated that it is not diabetes and that the drivers blood sugar levels were normal. They also stated that they were going to administer Narcan to see if it has any effect. While assessing the driver, EMS personnel also stated that they noticed his pupils were constricted. The driver was placed in a stretcher, and was escorted to the ambulance. Once in the ambulance, the driver was identified asDarryl Kevin Hargrove (1M DOB 12/20/1964). While in the ambulance, Hargrove stated that he took oxycodone for his neuropathy. Medic 129 transported Hargrove to Carroll Hospital Center for further evaluation. Geyers Towing was contacted to tow the disabled vehicle off the scene.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):    Once we arrived at the hospital, EMS personnel stated that while they were transporting Hargrove, he admitted to ingesting two to four tabs of his wifes 5mg of Oxycodone due to Hargroves neuropathy pain in his hands and his feet. He stated to EMS personnel that he ingested the tabs at approximately 0600-0630 hours that day and was heading to his pain management appointment. Due to the nature of the collision and Hargrove being transported to Carroll Hospital Center, SFSTs were not conducted. Hargrove was not offered a preliminary breath test. Hargrove was placed under arrest at Carroll Hospital Center at 0916 hours, and was read the DR15 Advice of Rights in English. Hargrove elected to refuse to submit to an evidentiary blood test, and signed the DR15 indicating the same at approximately 0930 hours. Hargrove was given and explained the pertinent paperwork and was released to the hospital staff at approximately 1029 hours.    On 03/11/2023, I attempted to contact the witness, identified by his name and date of birth as Robert Andrews (DOB 08/29/1946). He stated that he did not witness the collision, but stopped out to see if the driver was okay. He then stated as soon as he checked the drivers welfare, Deputes from the Carroll County Sheriffs Office arrived on scene.    An ACRS report was completed and submitted.    Due to the above stated facts, I request this case closed.    All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
