         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS:   Witness Statements  Chain of Custody for Knife  SUSPECTS    Khalel Washington (B/M, DOB: 3/8/2004)  VICTIM    Charles Little Jr. (B/M, DOB: 9/18/1996)  Scene Processing:    Photos were taken of exterior Chinese Food store  Photos taken of blood Splatter in Store  Photos taken of interior of Liquor store where crime occurred  NARRATIVE  On 1/19/2023 at approximately 1954 hours, I was dispatched to 1401 Pulaski Highway, Edgewood MD 21040 for a possible attempted robbery. Upon my arrival, at 1401 Pulaski Highway Unit D, I made contact with Harford County Deputies who advised there was a victim in the restaurant with a laceration to the face. EMS was contacted, and I asked the subject for his name. He identified himself a Khalel Washington, Black/Male. I asked Washington what happened, and he stated that he was just walking through the woods when some guys jumped him and cut his face. I attempted to ask Washington for a description or direction of travel for the suspects, and he began to get irate and yelling for EMS to expedite. Washington was stating he was feeling woozy and was starting to lose memory of the events. I stopped questioning and walked outside to obtain photos of the scene. While walking outside I was advised by a Harford County Deputy that the original victim Washington was actually the suspect who attempted to rob another person around the corner. I walked to the Woodbridge Liquors located at the same address and made contact with Deputy First Class Burgess who handed me the knife which caused the laceration on Washingtons face. The owner of the knife was Charles Little Jr.    Little stated he was speaking with Washington and another party through the selling app Offer up. They had coordinated to meet at 1706 Crimson Tree Way, Edgewood Md for the selling of a PS5. Little advised when he got on scene he was met by Washington and another unknown individual. Both parties advised Little that this was a robbery and to give up his money. Little advised he did not have any cash on his person. Washington and the other unknown party threatened to kill Little while reaching in their waistband. Washington then asked Little if he had a bank card to withdraw cash, Little replied yes and Washington got into the car and told Little to drive to a bank. Little drove to the MT Bank located in the Woodbridge Shopping Center. While en route Little advised he texted his mother robbery. After typing in the wrong pin at the bank Little suggested they go into the Liquor store to withdraw money. Both parties entered the Liquor storeand Little attempted to withdraw money. While stalling at the ATM, Littles wife Amber Eaton and sister-in-law Alicia Eaton ran into the store swinging a bat at Washington. An altercation ensued in the Liquor store and Washington ended up taking the bat. Washington ran out the store and attempted to come back into the store. Little, his wife, and sister-in-law were attempting to hold the door close to keep Washington out the store. Washington grabbed the door and Little stated he saw Washington reach in his waistband and say Im about to flip it out on you, you dont want to die over $20, give me that money. At that point Little reached for his pocket knife and cut Washington across the face. Washington then ran around the corner to the China Haste store and asked for EMS.    I request this case remain open pending investigation and charging from CID. All events occurred in Harford County Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText> On January 19, 2023, I was requested to assist the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack and TFC Arment with an assault and possible robbery investigation. Upon being contacted, I was requested to respond to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore City to interview Khalel Washington who had been transported to that location after being cut or stabbed. At that time, no additional details were provided and I was unaware of what exactly Washingtons involvement was in the incident. Upon my arrival at Bayview, I made contact with Trooper Montgomery who followed the ambulance from the scene to the hospital. Tpr. Montgomery did not have all of the details, but informed me that it was believed Washington was involved in some sort of attempted robbery and that he had been cut in the process. After speaking to Tpr. Montgomery, I interviewed Washington. Interview with Kalel Washington Washington, Khalel Juwan African American, Male, DOB: 03/08/2004 1709 Crimson Tree Apt. B, Edgewood, MD 21040   Upon entering Washingtons room, I immediately observed that he had a large laceration above his right eye that extended below his left eye. I then began speaking with Washington and identified myself as an investigator with the Maryland State Police and Washington immediately stated he wanted to tell me what happened. I stopped him from proceeding and advised him that I would like to record the interview and he agreed. As soon as the recording started, I reintroduced myself and asked Washington to identify himself. He proceeded by telling me his first and last name immediately followed by Am I getting locked up? I informed Washington that I still was not sure exactly what occurred and that I was there to get his account of what happened. I also informed him that I had no reason to place him under arrest at that time. According to Washington, he was walking through the woods near Woodbridge Way when he bumped into a fiend or drug addict who then sliced him then ran away. Washington stated nothing else had occurred prior to this that would have caused the subject to cut him, just that he was upset that Washington physically bumped into him. Washington stated it was a very brief encounter and he was unable to see the subject that cut him. He stated he just knew it was a junky because he had drugs on him and he could tell he had recently lost weight and had open sores. Otherwise, Washington was unable to recollect any details about the subject or exactly what occurred. When asked why he was at the location, Washington stated he was heading to the store to get liquor, but then said Im lying. I was trying to get some leafs from any store in the area that sold it. He could not recall if he had ever made it to the store. He would then advise that he was headed home.  Washington had nothing additional to add at the time and the recorded interview was concluded. Prior to leaving, I obtained photographs of Washingtons injury. I also positively identified Washington through a photograph obtained from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration.  Additional Actions  After interviewing Washington, I made contact with TFC Arment who was at the scene of the incident. We discussed the facts of the case and determined that no arrests would be made at that time. TFC Arment requested that I seize Washingtons cell phone as facts obtained at the scene indicated that the phone would more than likely contain evidence that would assist in the investigation. I had been told that Washingtons cell phone was located amongst his belongings on the floor. I informed Washington that we would be taking his phone and writing a search and seizure warrant for it and he had no objections. Washington provided the passcode to his phone as 537536. Washington was then left in the care of hospital staff.  After leaving the hospital, I responded to the scene where the incident occurred and assisted TFC Arment. I then took Washingtons cell phone to the Bel Air Barrack where I completed the appropriate paperwork and submitted it as evidence. This concludes my involvement in the case at this time.   </NarrativeText>
