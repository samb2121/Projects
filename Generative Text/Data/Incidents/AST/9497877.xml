         <NarrativeText>TYPE OF REPORT: Discharge Of Duty Weapon DATE: Tuesday, January 3rd, 2023 TIME: 2334 hrs.  VIDEO: This incident was recorded in its entirety by a dash mounted camera in MSP silver unmarked I-32  NARRATIVE:    On Tuesday, January 3rd, 2023 at approximately 11:34 PM, I (M/Tpr. Ian C. Rola #2705) was on patrol in the area of St. Michaels Rd  Easton Bypass when I observed a middle-aged deer standing in the roadway remaining motionless. I noted that the deer did not respond to my air horn or my vehicle that was directly in front of him. Closer inspection revealed that the deer was exhibiting signs of Chronic Wasting Disease. Chronic Wasting Disease is a noncontagious, insect-borne, viral disease which effects the nervous system in animals. Due to this sickness and the fear of spreading the disease, causing an accident  the health of the deer, I made the decision to put down the deer. There was no traffic in the area and the backdrop was a grassy hill, I expended two (2) rounds into the deer effectively killing the infected deer. I moved the deer to the shoulder and advised the Barrack to leave notification for SHA.    Afterwards I reported to the Easton Barrack and immediately replaced the two rounds used. At this time I request this case CLOSED due to the type of incident. All events occurred in Talbot County, Maryland.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:    -Glock 17 (Department Issued)   -Serial #: BTZZ894   -Replaced two (2) 9mm rounds  M/Tpr. Ian C. Rola #2705</NarrativeText>
