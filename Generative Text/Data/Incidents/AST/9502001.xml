         <NarrativeText>THIS STOP WAS AUDIBLY AND VISUALLY RECORDED ON F-4 ON IN-CAR CAMERAS AND BWC. DUI 23-149  TROOPER N. MANZIANO- ID #7363 MARYLAND STATE POLICE - NORTH EAST BARRACK F  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING:  -NHTSA CERTIFIED TO CONDUCT STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFST)  -ARIDE CERTIFIED   DESCRIPTION OF VIOLATION / INCIDENT / TRAFFIC STOP (VEHICLE IN MOTION)-  On December 2nd, 2023, at approximately 2009 hours, I Trooper Manziano #7363, was dispatched to Old Elk Neck Road and Turkey Point Road, Cecil County, Maryland, in my marked Maryland State Police vehicle F-4 for a vehicle not maintaining its lane. A Department of Natural Resources Police Sergeant was following the vehicle and advised the vehicle ran into a ditch.  Upon arrival, I observed a white Ram 1500 bearing Maryland registration C0011335 in a ditch with both driver side wheels up in the air and leaning to the right.   INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEFENDANT (PERSONAL CONTACT)-  I made contact with the driver of the white Ram 1500 who was identified by his Delaware drivers license as Raynald Yarld Allison (DOB: 11/04/1976, B/M.) I made contact with the NRP Sergeant David Leithren, and he advised Allison was driving erratically and not able to maintain his lane. I asked Sgt. Leithren to fill out a witness statement. While speaking to Allison, I could smell an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath. While speaking to Allison, I observed his eyes to be red and glassy. Allison was leaning up against the vehicle for support. Allison was limping and unsteady on his feet. Allsion went to retrieve his license and fell in the ditch in front of the vehicle. Allison refused medical treatment multiple times throughout the investigation. I asked him what happened, and he stated I was going to my job. I lose control. Allison was very emotional, upset, and would ramble on without answering the question. Allison kept asking if I was going to take him to court? I asked Allison if he was driving and he stated, Yes. On multiple occasions he stated, If you charge me, I will lose my job. Allison went to the ground and begged us. Allison stated, Im guilty. He would not elaborate on that comment. I asked if he had diabetes, and he said, Yes. I told him that I smell alcohol coming from his breath and person. He responded with, Thats true. Im not going to lie to you. I asked him how many drinks he had tonight. Allison stated,  I didnt have much. I took a drink.   I informed Allison that I would be performing standardized field sobriety tests (SFST) on him, to which he agreed to the tests.  Prior to administering SFST, I advised Allison, I was going to explain the instructions to each test.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  The evaluation was performed in the right lane of 426 Old Elk Neck Road. The surface was wet, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicles headlamps and my flashlight. The weather was foggy and raining. Allison was interrupting my instructions.  Allison was asked the following questions:  Glasses or Contacts - Glasses  Medical conditions - Diabetes  Injuries - None  Medication  Diabetes medication   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (N/A)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. Prior to the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Allison if he understood the test, and he advised he understood. Allisons pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Allison was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Allison was not able to follow directions and was too inebriated.   Allison was unable to take the tests and was placed in handcuffs. Allison was not cooperating and listening to my instructions. Allison kept interrupting my instructions and kept moving out of the instruction position. Allison was not listening, and it ended up as a refusal. Allison was cuffed and when we asked him to sit by the tire he fell over his feet and fell to his knees.   ARREST  Based on the following, I had probable cause to believe Allison was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  *Admitted to having 1 drink  *Glassy and red eyes  *Admitted to drinking prior to driving  *Open bottle of EJ VS Brandy %40 alcohol in cup holder  *My observed signs of impairment as Allison walked around the scene  *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his body and breath  *Allison stated, Im guilty.  A written statement was filled out bySgt. Leithren.  Allison was placed under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol.  Allison was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and transported to the Maryland State Police North East Barrack.  Allison was audio read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form in English at which time he accepted to take the breath test at 2146 hours. Allison made three insufficient breath samples which resulted in refusal of the test.  Allison was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and taken home.  All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.   Case closed due to arrest. </NarrativeText>
