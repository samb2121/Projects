         <NarrativeText>The below incident was captured on Axon body worn camera  ATTACHMENTS: 1 - Copy of Arrest Intake Report 1 - Copy of Statement of Probable Cause 1 - Copy of Statement of Charges 1 - Copy of Signed Warrant (#D220370312) 1 - Copy of Traffic Citations 1 - Copy of PA Identification Card 1 - Copy of MVA Print Out 2 - Copies of Domestic Violence Supplemental Report (one out-dated form and one up-to-date form)  VICTIM: Kelly Elizabeth Moore  W/F  DOB: 07/01/1992 2103 Jasmine Road Dundalk, Md 21222  STATEMENT: Moore stated that Clayton and herself went to a Johanssons Bar to celebrate a friends life who recently passed away in Westminster, MD. She stated that while they were at the bar they began to argue. I asked Moore what they were arguing about and she stated about how much Clayton drank tonight. She stated that they subsequently got into the vehicle to head to her mothers house to pick up her children when Clayton became very aggressive. Moore stated that he punched her with his right hand and then grabbed the back of her head and began hitting the center console with her head. She stated she blacked out and became very disoriented from the strikes. While I was talking with Moore, I did observe her lower lip to be bloody and her face red. I asked Moore what happened next? Moore stated that Clayton grabbed her throat with his right hand and began squeezing it. I asked if she could feel her airway or her blood vessels on her neck being constricted, and she stated yes. I asked if Clayton has ever hit her in previous arguments, and she stated yes. Moore stated to me that she thinks next time he is going to try and kill her. I explained to Moore the process of filing a protective order against Clayton and she stated she wanted to do that.  SUSPECT: Jeffrey Clayton  B/M  DOB: 05/10/1992 2103 Jasmine Road Dundalk, Md 21222   STATEMENT: I asked Clayton if he struck or choked Moore in any way and he stated no nothing. I then asked Clayton why he left his fianc in a parking lot crying and bleeding from her lip. He stated that he wanted to distance himself from the situation and walked to Wawa to get something to eat. Clayton stated that Moore and himself were argue about him talking to other women at the bar. I observed Clayton to have a small scratch on the left side of his face under his ear. I asked Clayton what caused that, and he stated from Moore hitting him. I asked Clayton if I could photograph the injury, and he stated no. I asked Clayton if he was driving the car when they began arguing, and he stated yes. I asked Clayton if knew he didnt have a license, and he stated that he did. The entire time I was talking with Clayton I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage from his breath. An MVA check of Claytons license status revealed it to be ID only, see attachments.  SCENE PROCESSING: I photographed the vehicle and the victims injuries. The photograph of the victims face does not show the blood on her lip because at the time the photo was taken the victim had already cleaned up the blood at the Hospital. The suspect refused to have photographs taken of him. The vehicle was towed per the owners request by Leckrons towing. The Domestic Supplemental Report was completed, and a Counselor was called. Moore spoke with Counselor Emma at 0350 hours.  NARRATIVE: On February 25, 2023, at approximately 0231 hours, I, TFC Adle of the Maryland State Police was dispatched to the report of a female who was assaulted in her vehicle. The Westminster Barrack advised that the vehicle was stopped on eastbound Maryland Route 140 at Market St. The Barrack continued to advise that the male subject assaulted his fianc and fled the scene.  On scene at 0235 hours, I observed the vehicle parked in a nearby parking lot at the intersection of Maryland Route 140 at Market St. with the drivers side door open. The vehicle was a black Chrystler Pacifica bearing Maryland registration 3EV5695. Inside the vehicle was a single occupant who was later identified as the victim and passenger, Kelly Moore (W/F DOB: 07/01/1992). I asked Moore where the driver was, and she stated that he fled the scene about 25 minutes ago. The driver/suspect was later identified as Jeffrey Clayton (B/M DOB: 05/10/1992). TFC Spencer canvassed the area however he was unable to locate Clayton.  Moore was sitting in the passenger seat crying and very emotional. I observed Moore to have a bloody lower lip, her eyes to be bloodshot and her face to be red. I also detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle. I asked Moore what happened and Moore provided the above statement about the assault. EMS arrived at the scene and subsequently transported her to Carroll Hospital Center for treatment at 0251 hours. At the hospital, Moore screened in at a high danger level and stated that she thinks hell kill her next time. I did not observe any bruising to her neck at this time. I asked Moore how long they have been together, and she stated five years. I asked if Clayton has ever been arrested for Domestic Violence before, and she stated yes. I asked Moore if they live together, and she stated yes.  Forensic Nurse Examiner Tracy Yingling stated that she did not observe any internal bruising on Moores neck utilizing an alternative light source (ALS) camera. Nurse Yingling did however state she observed visible redness on her neck.  At 0405 hours, theWestminster Barrack advised that the suspect, Jeffrey Clayton was at the Barrack. TFC Spencer relieved me at the hospital, and I responded to the Barrack. At the Barrack I observed Mr. Clayton standing outside the lobby with Cpl. Karas. I placed Clayton under arrest for a Baltimore County, Towson warrant for first and second degree assault from a previous domestic violence incident with the victim. I also explained to Clayton he was under arrest tonight for first and second degree assault again for domestic violence at 0427 hours. I read Clayton his Miranda Rights in their entirety which he stated he understood and agreed to answer questions. I began asking Clayton questions, see his above statement.  Clayton was transported to central booking for processing.  At 0708 hours, TFC Horner arrived at Carroll Hospital Center and placed Moore under arrest for a Pennsylvanian warrant unrelated to this incident after she was discharged, see supplement.  I respectfully request this case be CLOSED by arrest. </NarrativeText>

Moore had a active Bench Warrant through Adams County Pennsylvania. Moore was identified by her Maryland Soundex number being listed for the Pennsylvania Warrant. Adams County Department of Emergency Services confirmed the warrant and advised they would extradite from Carroll County MD. Moore was discharged from the hospital and placed under arrest at approximately 0708 hours. Moore was transported Carroll County Detention Center and released to the care and custody of the Carroll County Sheriffs Department. I filed the Fugitive from Justice paperwork and submitted it to the Carroll County District Court Commissioners Office.  All of the Above Events Occurred in Carroll County MD  </NarrativeText>
