         <NarrativeText>N-19 is equipped with a mobile recording device Defendant: Betselot Hiluf Gebretekle  Date of Birth: 03/26/1992 Date of Arrest: 01/21/2023 Time of Arrest: 0229 hours MD SDX: MD-10273580586 DUI #: 23-020 (Rockville)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Certified by NHTSA to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) * Certified as a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator  * Certified in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE)  * Attended the 2021 Maryland Impaired Driving Conference in Ocean City, Maryland * Participated in several DUI Special Assignments * DUI Award Recipient for 2021  2022. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Saturday, January 21st, 2023 at approximately 0210 hours, I, Trooper First Class Canizalez #7087, was on patrol operating unmarked Maryland State Police patrol vehicle N-19. At that time, I was dispatched to the ramp from the Innerloop of I-495 towards southbound Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland for a silver Lexus stopped at an intersection with the driver asleep behind the wheel. Upon arrival, I observed a silver Lexus CT200 bearing Maryland Registration 2EE3780 in lane 1 stopped at the traffic light. During my approach, I observed the driver of the vehicle to be asleep behind the wheel, seat belted, car in park with the remote start keys in the drivers area, with the engine running. I proceeded to contact the driver for a welfare check.  CONTACT (PHASE 2) During my attempt to contact the driver, I had to knock on the window several times in order to wake up the driver to which he did. I had the driver lower the window to better communicate. Once lowered, I introduced myself and questioned the driver on his welfare status and if he needed any medical attention. The driver advised that he did not need any medical attention. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage from within the vehicle. I observed other signs of impairment from the driver such as blood shot and glassy eyes along with being very disoriented. I questioned the driver on his travels and the driver stated he was coming from an event and was headed home. The driver was identified by his Maryland Drivers License as: GEBRETEKLE, Betselot Hiluf. (MD SDX: MD-10273580586, B/M, DOB: 03/26/1992) While speaking with GEBRETEKLE from the driver side, I questioned the driver on how many alcoholic beverages he consumed that night prior to driving. The driver stated he had consumed 2 old fashions approximately three to four hours prior to driving. I asked GEBRETEKLE to step out of the vehicle for further questioning in attempts to separate him from his vehicle. Once outside the vehicle, I asked GEBRETEKLE a series of questions which allowed me to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath even with traffic passing. I asked the driver if he was willing to perform voluntary SFSTs and he advised that he would. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed in lane 1 on the ramp from the Innerloop of I-495 towards southbound Georgia Ave. (pavement). The surface was dry, level and free from any debris. The weather was clear and light condition consisted of my flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. GEBRETEKLE appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. Prior to beginning the test, I asked GEBRETEKLE the following questions: Glasses or Contacts: None Medical Conditions: None Injuries: None  Medications: None *TEST #1 HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): 6/6 The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches, slightly above eye level. I instructed GEBRETEKLE to look straight ahead, keeping his head stationary while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. I asked GEBRETEKLE if he understood the test and he stated Yes. GEBRETEKLEs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. GEBRETEKLE was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Vertical Gaze Nystagmus: Present in both eyes.   *TEST #2 WALK AND TURN (WAT): 4/8 Prior to GEBRETEKLE performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. GEBRETEKLE was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe on the white solid line on the right shoulder. GEBRETEKLE was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin the test. GEBRETEKLE was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. GEBRETEKLE was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, GEBRETEKLE was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. GEBRETEKLE was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. GEBRETEKLE was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked GEBRETEKLE if he understood the test and he stated, Yes.    GEBRETEKLE began the test prior to being instructed to do so.   GEBRETEKLE stopped walking on his 9th step prior to doing the turn.   GEBRETEKLE missed heel-to-toe on his 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th step during his second set.   GEBRETEKLE did not complete the turn correctly.   *TEST #3 ONE LEG STAND (OLS): 1/4 Prior to GEBRETEKLE performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. GEBRETEKLE was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count aloud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. GEBRETEKLE was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes. GEBRETEKLE performed this test balanced on his right foot.    GEBRETEKLE put his foot down at the 3rd second mark.  I offered GEBRETEKLE a preliminary breath test and he advised that he would not take it.  PBT results: REFUSAL ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe GEBRETEKLE was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of an alcoholic beverage: * GEBRETEKLE was found asleep behind the wheel with the keys in the vehicle and the vehicle still running.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from GEBRETEKLEs breath. * Bloodshot and glassy eyes. * GEBRETEKLE admitting having consumed 2 old fashions 3-4 hours prior to driving.  Due to the number of observations, I had reason to believe GEBRETEKLE was driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and was unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0229 hours, I placed GEBRETEKLE under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol. A preliminary search of GEBRETEKLE was conducted on the scene, and it revealed that he had nothing on his person. GEBRETEKLE was seat belted into my unmarked MSP patrol vehicle N-19 and was transported to the MSP Rockville Barrack per departmental policy. While conducting the secondary search on GEBRETEKLE at the barrack, his oral cavity was checked and was clear and had nothing in his mouth. During the 20-minute observation period, GEBRETEKLE remained in my custody and did not introduce any foreign object in his mouth. The DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to GEBRETEKLE at 0255 hours. Upon completion of being read the DR-15, GEBRETEKLE agreed to submit to the intoximeter test.  INTOXIMETER RESULT  0.11 GRAMS OF ALCOHOL PER 210 LITERS OF BREATH GEBRETEKLE was given all pertinent paperwork and was released to Mohammad Ahmadkhani at 0332 hours.  Case status: closed by arrest. All events occurred in MontgomeryCounty, Maryland </NarrativeText>
