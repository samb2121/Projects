         <NarrativeText>  On 4/16/2023 at approximately 1541 hrs., S/Tpr Fairbanks and TFC DeMoss responded to the area of National Hwy (Rt 40) near Texas Grill House 1222 National Hwy Lavale, MD 21502 in reference to a road rage incident that turned into an assault. The third party caller, Olivia McCoy advised a white male got out of his vehicle and assaulted an older male that was inside his vehicle. While on the phone with 911, both the suspect and the victim left the scene. She described the suspect / agressors vehicle as a black Volkswagon Jetta with MD registration 5Z9753. She said the Jetta turned onto Vocke Rd toward I68 from Rt 40. She said the victims vehicle was an older Mercury SUV. The vicitm in this case was unable to be immediately identified.    S/Tpr Fairbanks continued on Winchester Rd towards Cresaptown and located a black Volkswagon Jetta with the same MD registration 5Z9753 and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle in front of Sheetz Cresaptown, MD on Rt 220. The driver was identified as Nathan Paul Cordial 2/18/93. Cordial advised S/Tpr Fairbanks that he had been involved in a confrontation with an unknown individual. He said that a vehicle pulled out in front of him on National Hwy (Rt 40) near Staples in Lavale, MD. He said the vehicle slammed on his brakes in front of Cordials vehicle, and gave him the middle finger. He said both vehicles stopped in the roadway. Cordial said he exited his vehicle and went directly to the other vehicle and grabbed hold of the individual who was still seated in his vehicle. Cordial did not report to troopers on scene that he had been assaulted.    On 4/18/2023 another similar incident occurred involving the same individual Nathan Cordial. During conversations with Cordials Fiance, she advised she was contacted by a Chrissy Kasekamp on Facebook Messenger indicating it was her father that was involved in the above described assault. I, Sgt. Langley, made telephone contact with Kasekamp, who directed me to her father, William Edward Gray. Gray advised he initially didnt want to deal with the legal process involved with obtaining charges, but has since heard of other incidents involving Nathan Cordial. Gray advised me he was driving a silver Mercury Mariner on Rt 40 when he noticed a vehicle behind him that was blowing his horn and making gestures at him. He stopped his vehicle to see what was wrong. He said he started to get out of the vehicle and out of nowhere he was pushed down in his seat by the suspect, who he later found out to be Nathan Cordial. He said that Cordial grabbed his neck and was on top of him inside his vehicle holding him down. He said he struggled momentarily and was able to get his left arm free to defend himself. He said he struck Nathan Cordial in the face in an attempt to get him off of him. He said Cordial returned to his vehicle and left the scene while screaming obscenities toward him.    Photos were taken of the victims injuries 3 days after the assault and forwarded to me by email. They were uploaded to Veripic.    On 4/20/2023 Nathan Cordial was arrested by TFC Demoss on 2 barrack arrest warrants for two separate similar incidents. TFC Demoss notified Cordial of his Miranda rights by reading them from a Miranda card from his pocket. Cordial advised that Gray pulled out in front of him and gestured that he had a gun with his hand out the window. He also gave him the middle finger before stopping in the roadway. Cordial said he got out of his car and approached Gray. Gray swung the door open and punched him in the face. Thats when he defended himself and grabbed Gray by the neck. After further questioning he continued to argue that Gray was able to punch Cordial while still seated in the vehicle. When Cordial was contacted by troopers and told them what happened, he stated that the driving altercation occurred, and then he walked up to the car and grabbed hold of him, meaning the driver. He didnt mention at that time that he had been assaulted. When asked why he didnt mention it, he said that he didnt remember at that time that he had been punched. Cordial was asked again that he said he was defending himself when he grabbed him, so why didnt he remember that he had been assaulted. He responded that he wasnt sure, and that he just screwed up. A DNA swab was completed on the suspect due to the qualifying crime.    On 4/20/23 I re-contacted the original complainant, Olivia McCoy for additional information. McCoy advised me that she was at the traffic light and observed a silver Mercury and a black Jetta stopped in the road. She could hear the driver of the black Jetta yelling to the other vehicle, You wont get out of the car mother fucker. She said the driver of the Jetta got out of his car and approached the drivers side of the silver Mercury. The driver of the Mercury opened his door, and the driver of the Jetta immediately grabbed the other driver by the neck and pushed him into his vehicle. She said he was leaning in the other drivers vehicle over top of him while holding him down by the neck. She estimated that lasted approximately 15-20 seconds while the driver of the Jetta yelled at the other driver. She said she never saw the driver of the Mercury assault the driver of the Jetta, and that the driver of the Jetta initiated the assault.  Based on the above facts, I request this case be closed by arrest. The victim was notified of the case status.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On 04/16/2023 at approximately 1539 hours, I was dispatched to the Texas Grill House located ta 1222 National Hwy, LaVale, MD for report of an assault in progress. While responding, I was advised by MSP Cumberland Barrack dispatch that the suspect/party involved left the scene in a black Volkswagen sedan. Additionally, I was advised that the suspect was seen traveling southbound on Winchester Rd. TFC Demoss continued to the Texas Grill House and I responded down to the area where the suspect was last seen. While traveling south on Winchester Rd, I caught up to the suspect vehicle (black Volkswagen sedan Displaying MD Reg 5Z9753) and conducted a traffic stop on US RT 220 at Warrior Dr.    I then made contact with the driver/suspect,Nathan Paul Cordial 2/18/93 (PH# 240-727-5515) and his passenger, Michalia Leigh Murphy W/F 07/28/1994. Nathan Cordial appeared to be immediately agitated upon the traffic stop. I then explained to Nathan Cordial the reason I was contacting him.Nathan Cordial admitted to being at the Texas Grill House and advised that he was in an altercation with another individual stemming from a road rage incident. Due to not having a victim at the time I contactedNathan Cordial, no further action was taken andNathan Cordial was released. Cordial/Murphy provided an address of 15819 McMullen Hwy Apt D2, Cumberland, MD. I request this case remain OPEN pending further investigation by SGT Langley. All events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.  CASE OPEN.   </NarrativeText>
