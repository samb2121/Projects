         <NarrativeText>TROOPER D. Walker- ID #7010 MARYLAND STATE POLICE  EASTON BARRACK I CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING: -NHTSA CERTIFIED TO CONDUCT STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFST) -CERTIFIED PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) OPERATOR - I attended and successfully completed A.R.I.D.E (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) training  March, 2022.  DESCRIPTION OF VIOLATION / INCIDENT / TRAFFIC STOP (VEHICLE IN MOTION)- On 09/14/2023 at approximately 2210 hours, I Trooper Walker, was dispatched to a single vehicle accident in the area of Dover Bridge Road and TJ Farms. While enroute to the scene, the caller advised the barrack that the driver was stuck in the marsh and was trying to get the vehicle out of the ditch by accelerating on the gas heavily. I then arrived on scene and activated my emergency lights, I identified the vehicle as a Black Jeep SUV (MD/3CM5367) INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEFENDANT (PERSONAL CONTACT)- As I approached the scene I made contact with the driver and soul occupant of the vehicle. I identified the driver as Kaneisha Lafaye Copper 1/F DOB (06/27/1994) who I identified by her Maryland Drivers license. In speaking with Copper I asked her what happened to cause her to go off the road, and in speaking with Copper I immediately detected a strong odor of and alcoholic beverage emitting from her person and breath and noticed her eyes to be bloodshot, watery and glassy. Copper stated I was cut off by someone who was driving in-front of me apparently I was driving to slow, they came in front of me and it freaked me out, so I drove into the marsh apparently. Copper stated she was coming from Baltimore and heading to her boyfriends house in Hurlock. I then asked Copper if she had anything to drink, Copper Stated Not alot. I then asked Copper what drink she had before she drove and she stated An Apple Ale I asked her when was her last drink and she advised noon. I asked Copper if she would be willing to perform in standardized field and sobriety test, Copper willingly agreed. Prior to taking the test, I asked Copper if she had any medical conditions that would interrupt her performance on the test, Copper advised she did not. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The first test I explained to Copper was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. Copper then stated she understood the test. As I began the test, I observed Coppers pupils were of equal size and her eyes tracked equally. During the test, I observed Copper lacked smooth pursuit in both her right and left eye. I then observed Copper had distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both her right and left eye. I also observed Copper had onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both her right and left eye.(Clues:6/6) Note: I advised Copper multiple times to follow my finger and not to move her head.  The next test I conducted with Copper was the Walk and Turn test. This test was conducted using the paved portion of the roadway that was level and clear of debris. For the instructional portion of the test, Copper was asked to stand with her right foot in front of her left in a straight line. After Copper was placed it the starting position placing her right foot in front of her left, I advised her not to move until I instructed her to start. Copper was having a difficult time remaining in the starting position of the test. Copper did not remain in the starting position and started too soon. On the first set of 9 steps Copper stepped off line and missed heal to toe. As Copper approached her final step she completed an improper turn. Copper took 10 steps when she was instructed to take 9 steps. On the second set of 9 steps Copper again missed heel to toe and stepped off line. Actual steps taken 9.(Clues 5/8)  Next I explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Copper. Upon completion of my demonstration, Copper advised she understood the test and began by raising her right foot. Copper began to sway, placed her foot down and raised her arms for balance as she counted. (Clues:3/4)   I then had my shift partner TFC. Griffin #6393 to retrieve his PBT from his patrol vehicle (I-44). I explained to Copper the reason for using a PBT. Copper submitted a breath sample of .198.  Copper was then taken into custody at 2230 hours. At that time, I placed Copper in my vehicle (I-46). Copper was then advised of her DR-15 Advice Of Rights by MVA recording and paper copy.  Copper then requested EMS to check her out due to her head hurting. EMS responded to the barrack and Copper refused EMS treatment.  After hearing the recording, Copper refused to submit to the breath test at 2237 hours. I then transported Copper to the MSP Easton barrack where she received all of her paper work. Copper was later released to a sober driver.  All events did occur in Caroline County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
