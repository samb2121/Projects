I made contact with the complainants, who were identified by their Maryland Drivers License as Justin James Barlow (W/M DOB 01/19/1981) and Amy Elizabeth Barlow (W/F DOB 10/26/1976). Justin and Amy both advised, on September 15, 2023 between 1545 and 1600 hours, their daughter got off a St. Marys County Public School Bus #610 with a bloody nose.

Justin and Amy advised since the incident occurred, Madyson has had trouble sleeping at night and has had nightmares about the incident.   Justin and Amy advised they have had multiple problems with this school bus driver during the last school year. They advised the school bus driver has yelled at the children before, threatening to duct tape the children to the seat. They advised on one occasion the school bus driver pulled over on the side of the road. The school bus driver opened the doors to the bus and threated to make the kids walk home. Justin and Amy made several complainants last year to Jeff Thompson, the Director of the Department of Transportation. Justin and Amy advised their complainants were dismissed by Thompson. Justin and Amy along with several other parents filed a complaint against the bus driver for the incident that occurred on September 15, 2023. Amy advised she received an email on September 18, 2023 from Vean Barr, Driver Trainer of the Department of Transportation, stating they are investigating the incident and will take corrective actions accordingly.   Justin and Amy advised they filed a request to view the video surveillance from the school bus. On September 25, 2023 they reviewed the video surveillance. They advised the footage shows that there is nothing in front of the school bus, while it is traveling down the road, which would cause the driver to slam on the brakes. They advised the footage shows the school bus driver yelling at the kids and suddenly brake checks the kids out of anger. They advised the video footage shows the school buses speed, which suddenly goes from 37mph to 27mph in a second. They advised the footage shows Madyson hitting her face on the seat in front of her.

         <NarrativeText> Narrative:   On 9/29/2023 at 1330 hours Sgt T. Newcomer # 6072 CED-Central-South and I responded to the Board of Education for St. Marys County, MD to meet with the Director of School Safety, Charles Eible.    Upon arriving, Mr. Eible escorted us to his office where he had the Buss cameras in a multi-cam view displayed on a television. Mr. Eible played the video multiple times with audio so I and Sgt. Newcomer could view it. While viewing the video, I observed the video started at 1606 hours and the bus appeared to be traveling on Pin Cushion Road, the cross street was not identified during the portion of the video I viewed.    At 1607 hours the driver applies the brakes, the buss speed drop from approximately 36 mph to 27 mph. As a result, of the abrupt application of the brakes, I did not observe any actions that would have caused any obvious injury to the students. Due to the childrens age, height/size some of the children are not fully visible on camera due to the height of the seat in front of them. I did not hear any screaming or crying and there was no obvious, audible/verbal mention of anyone being injured. After applying the brakes, the driver does not accelerate but continues to slowly come to a stop. At this time he was not at a specific stop to drop off children, he stopped so he could attempt to get the children to quiet down. You then heard the driver, yell for the children/students to sit down, be quiet. He then advised he would take the children back to school and they would not get home until 5 o clock. He also advised he would write or have the students written up. After speaking to the children, the driver accelerates, travels a short distance then stops to let a child off of the bus.   After viewing the video, Mr. Eible advised the driver is a contracted employee through the Department of Transportation and referred us to Mr. Jeff Thompson for any further inquiries regarding the driver/bus. Mr. Eible did advise the driver is no longer covering/driving that elementary route and he believes he was moved to a High School route. Mr. Eible advised the initial complaint was made by email to them on 9/15/2023.   On 10/4/2023 at 1300 hours I responded to the Circuit Court for St. Marys County to meet with ASA S. Proctor regarding this incident. Sgt. Newcomer and Cpl. Posey, CED-Central South were also in attendance during the meeting. ASA Proctor received numerous items relevant to this investigation as a result of a grand jury subpoena from the SMCPS. While in the office, all parties watched the bus surveillance video numerous times and through multiple camera views. After watching the video, ASA Proctor advised she would not recommend criminal charges at this time against the driver.  Case closed.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #2 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Below is a synopsis of interviews completed by CED Central South. These interviews copies are going to be obtained from Saint Marys Department of Child Services.  Interview #1: On 09/28/2023, I was present to observe the forensic interview of Sage Hong reference to case number 23-MSP-033832. During this incident, it was conveyed that Sage, who is 12 years old, was on Saint Marys County school bus 610 which was operated by John Wathen. While on the school bus on or about September 15th, 2023, Wathen is alleged to have brake checked the bus causing students to be thrown throughout the bus.  The interview was conducted by Brittany Morgan of the Saint Marys County Department of Social Services. Brittany began the interview at approximately 1040 hours. Present in the room for the interview was Morgan and Sage. Myself, Cpl. C. Ditoto and Lisa Sheehan of the Saint Marys County Department of Social Services were present in the viewing room. Sages parents, Brandi Michelle Hong (W/F DOB: 1/27/1979) and Joseph Michael Hong (W/M DOB: 07/21/1978) were present in the building during the interview.  Brittany began the interview with Sage in rapport building. Sage appeared comfortable speaking to Brittany. Sage stated on this particular day her bus was running late. She stated all the students boarded the bus in a normal fashion. The students boarded the bus at Benjamin Banneker elementary. Upon boarding the bus, students were acting in a normal fashion. However, no one appeared to be yelling or screaming. Sage stated Wathen yelled, Shut up Carter to one of the students before slamming on the brakes of the bus. Upon slamming on the brakes of the bus, multiple students suffered involuntary bodily movements due to the inertia of the vehicle. During this involuntary movement, Sages head came in contact with the seat directly in front of her seat. Sage described the seat as being a normal bus seat which she described as hollow in the middle outlined by a metal bar. Sages face came in contact with the metal bar. This contact caused Sages glasses to be pushed into her face. The end result was Sage suffering a bruise on her face, between her eyes, just above her nose. Sage also stated a little girl on the bus suffered a bloody nose. The interview concluded with no further investigative information being provided.  I made contact with Brandi and Joseph. Brandi and Joseph both described the injuries sustained by their daughter as concerning. However, it was apparent the parents were both extremely frustrated with the response of the school administration. Brandi and Joseph had not seen the video of the incident, however, were aware that a video was available. Brandi and Joseph were also told by other parents what was on the video and were concerned about this. Brandi and Joseph both stated this has been an ongoing issue with Wathen and the students. Although attempts have been made to notify the school, nothing has been done by the school to correct what the parents viewed as an ongoing issue. Brandi and Joseph were provided contact information for the State Police as well as reissued the case number.  This concludes my portion of the investigation.  All events occurred in Saint Marys County, MD.  Interview #2:  On September 28, 2023, at approximately 1300 hours a Forensic Interview was conducted at the St. Marys County Child Advocacy Center for one of the juvenile victims (Madisyn Barlow 7 year old). The interview was conducted by Brittany Morgan of Child Protective Services and TFC Ruggles and Cpl. C. DiToto were present and observed the interview.  In relation to this incident which occurred on September 15, 2023, the victim advised she was aboard the school bus which was to be transporting her home at the end of the school day. She stated the bus was driven by Mr.Wathen. The victim said, Mr.Wathenstopped the bus and let kids off and as he was accelerating from the stop he began to yell at other kids on the bus because everyone was being loud. The victim stated Mr.Wathenyelled at the juveniles on the bus to sit down and be quite and shortly thereafter the bus abruptly slowed speed causing several juveniles and their belongings to be thrown forward either into the seats in front of them or into the isle. The victim advised prior to the bus abruptly slowing speed she was itching the inside of her nose and there was no blood in her nose; however after the bus abruptly slowed its speed she itched the inside of her nose again and this time there was a small amount of blood in her nose. The victim said after she got off the bus she was picked up by her father, Justin James Barlow (W/M DOB: 01/19/1981) who she informed of the incident. The victim advised approximately two days later she was playing soccer and for no reason her nose started bleeding profusely, and she was unable to continue to play soccer as her nose would not stop bleeding. The victim made several other statements about previous issues of Mr.Wathenbeing rude and discourteous to juveniles on the bus.  TFC Ruggles, Cpl. C. DiToto, Lisa Sheehan (CPS/CAC) and Brittany Morgan spoke to the juveniles parents, Justin and Amy Elizabeth Barlow (W/F DOB: 10/26/1976). They voiced their concerns on how they did not feel the incident was handled appropriately by the St. Marys County Board of Education or the St. Marys County Sheriffs Office. Justin confirmed his daughter did have a small amount of blood coming from her nose upon exiting the school bus on 9/15/23. Justin further confirmed on 9/17/23 his daughter had a sudden and unexplained nose bleed while playing soccer, and it took several minutes and multiple tissues/paper towels in order to stop and clean the bleeding. Justin advised at this time he has not yet taken his daughter to the doctor to see if she has any sort of internal injury to her nose which may have been the cause for the nose bleed. Justin and Amy both advised of several other incidents of Mr.Wathenbeing rude, discourteous and otherwise unprofessional to the juveniles on the bus which they were aware of. Amy also provided investigators with a photograph of Mr.Wathento assist in his identification. Investigators explained to Justin and Amy, once all evidence is gathered it will be provided to the St. Marys County States Attorneys Office, and it will be up to them to determine if there is sufficient evidence to believe a crime occurred and charges should be pursued.  Interview #3  #4:   On 9/28/2023 at approximately 1430 hours, Cpl. Posey responded to the St. Marys County Child Advocacy center at 21783 North Coral Drive Lexington Park, MD 20653, for forensic interviews of two children. The youths were involved in an incident, on their School bus, where the bus driver was said to have slammed on the brakes due to disruptive activity on the bus. Cpl. Posey made contact with Mrs. Oleary who is the mother of the two boys to be interviewed. Cpl. Posey developed a rapport with Mrs. Oleary to help her feel more comfortable with her boys being interviewed outside her presence. Mrs. Oleary agreed to have the boys individually interviewed by Child Protective Services investigator Brittany Morgan.  The first interview conducted was with Kerrick Oleary. During the course of this interview the youth advised he was on the bus and the bus driver was yelling. The reason given for the bus drivers outburst was that a friend of his got in trouble. The youth advised the bus driver slammed on brakes and everybody on the bus went forward. The youth stated he hit his face on the seat in front of him and the right side of his head was hurt. The youth identified the bus driver as Mr. Wathen.   The second interview was conducted with Langston OLeary also by Brittany Morgan. During the course of this interview, the youth identified the bus driver as Mr. Wathen. The youth stated Carter was not in his seat and he was saying bad words. The youth stated the bus driver slammed on the brakes, Sage glasses got smushed, and Maddie got a bloody nose. The youth continued stating the bus driver said he was going to make all the kids walk home. The youth advised he did not sustain any injuries during this incident. The youth stated his only concern was that the bus driver would come back to work and do the same thing again.  These interviews were audibly and visually recorded by the Child advocacy center. This report is intended to summarize the interviews. Access to interview footage is available to authorized personnel.  Interview #5:   On 10/4/2023 at approximately 1000 hours, Cpl. Posey responded to the St. Marys County Child Advocacy center at 21783 North Coral Drive Lexington Park, MD 20653, for forensic interviews of two children. The youths were involved in an incident, on their School bus, where the bus driver was said to have slammed on the brakes due to disruptive activity on the bus. Cpl. Posey observed the interview of a child who was on the bus from the Schulz family, during the interview the following was observed,Schultz advised the Bus Drivers Name was Mr. Wathen,Schulz advised Wathen stopped the bus and stated if you dont be quiet youre going to walk home. Schulz heard kids laughing.Schulz stated his friend got her glasses broke and had a bloody nose. Schulz said kids were being loud and screaming.Schulz stated Mr. Wathen didnt really do anything, but he stomped on the brakes. That concluded this interview.   Interview #6  #7:  On 10/4/2023 at approximately 0850 hours, Sgt. Newcomer responded to the St. Marys child Advocacy center at 21783 North Coral Drive Lexington Park, MD 20653, for forensic interviews of two children. The two children were involved in an incident on their school bus where the brakes were applied causing rapid deceleration of the school bus. The two children were from the Ianeiro family, and they were transported to the facility by their mother, Laura Ianiero. The two children who were interviewed advised the bus driver hit the brakes causing other children to make contact with the seat in front of them. The children advised they didnt sustain any injuries, but they think other children on the bus did. A full interview report will be attached to this case file. After the interview Sgt. Newcomer made contact with Mrs. Ianiero, her main concern was that the bus driver be punished, and he is removed from driving their children to school. I advised to Mrs. Ianiero that as the Maryland State Police we only investigate if a crime occurred and her chief complaint would have to be taken to the Saint Marys County Board of Education and the Saint Marys County Department of Transportation. Mrs. Ianiero was receptive and I advised the St. Marys County States Attorneys Office would keep her up to date with the case as it progresses.  On 10/4/23 investigators with MSP CED Central South met with Saint Marys County Assistant States Attorney Sarah Proctor to review the case. Proctor sent a legal request to St. Marys County Public Schools to receive the footage of the bus incident and related documents. Proctor received the supplies on 10/3/23. Proctor watched the video of the bus incident along with investigators and determined this incident does contain substance for a criminal charge. Proctor advised she will have the alleged victims parents come into the St. Marys County ASA office and she will notify them of her findings. This case remains with the MSP Leonardtown Barrack, and this concludes CED Central Souths involvement in the matter.  Case Closed.       </NarrativeText>
