         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #2 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>FOCUS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:   This report documents my initial response in regard to the murder investigation of JaSiah SinCer Basnight- Johnson on 04/16/2023. The initial incident occurred in the Pizza City Parking lot, located at 301 E. Carroll Street, Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland 21804.    NARRATIVE:     On Sunday, 04/16/2023 at approximately 0118 hours, I was notified by Sgt. Stephen Hallman (Acting Detective Sergeant of the CED Homicide Unit Eastern Region) in reference to a shooting that had occurred outside the Pizza City restaurant where one male, later identified as JaSiah SinCer Basnight- Johnson, herein referred to as Johnson, had succumbed to his injuries. Sgt. Hallman advised that there was a second shooting victim, later identified as JaMere Capri Maynes, AA/M, DOB: 0610/2001, herein referred to as Maynes. I was directed to respond to TidalHealth Peninsula Medical Center, located at 100 E. Carroll Street, Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland in order to contact the victims as well as process any evidence.    Upon arrival at 0229 hours, I observed Cpl. Connor Willey of the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit already interviewing hospital staff regarding the victim(s) conditions.    CRIME SCENE PROCESSING HOSPITAL:  At 0229 hours, I arrived at Tidal Health and met with the SPD officers securing both hospital rooms. CST Melissa Harvey (Maryland State Police Crime Scene Technician), who was assigned crime scene technician for the investigation responded to Tidal Health Peninsula in order to process the hospital scene. CST Harvey was able to take photographs of Johnson inside the emergency room, as well as his injuries. Johnson had an apparent gunshot wound to his head as well as multiple gunshot wounds along his back and body. I assisted CST Harvey with collecting Johnsons property and clothing from his room. I noted that Johnsons clothing was removed by the hospital staff and placed into a brown paper bag for law enforcement. I noted that there were no weapons or cellular devices within Johnsons property or clothing. CST Harvey advised she would photograph the clothing at a separate date and time.    CST Harvey and I began processing the second hospital room where Maynes was being treated for his gunshot wounds. I noted Maynes was conscious and able to speak. While Cpl. Willey interviewed Maynes, I assisted CST Harvey with processing and collecting Maynes clothing and property from within the room. I noted that hospital staff had already removed Maynes clothing prior to our arrival and placed it in a pile within the room. CST Harvey was able to photograph Maynes injuries and advised she would photograph Maynes clothing more thoroughly at a later date and time.    While searching Maynes clothing, I located two-dollar bills US Currency, one yellow condom wrapper, and a white air pod container without the air pods. I collected those items and released them to Maynes mother in the hospital lobby that same day.    F.I. (Forensic Investigator) Charles C. Ward responded to the hospital scene. OCME Case No. 23-04832. F.I. Ward advised Johnson would be transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, Maryland for a full autopsy.    SPD investigator Barkley and I met with the next of kin, identified as Diere Horsy (sister) and Sharron Horsey (brother), in a separate hospital room near the lobby. I noted that both subjects were extremely distraught and emotional. Notification was made to the next of kin regarding Johnsons death. The family was unable to provide any information regarding the incident. Diere Horsy provided me with a telephone number of (443) 754-2159 for Johnson, who she identified as Jo.     CRIME SCENE PROCESSING (PIZZA CITY  E. CARROLL ST):   I responded to Pizza City parking lot and was briefed by Sgt. Hallman.
