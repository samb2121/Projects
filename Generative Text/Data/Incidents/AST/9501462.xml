         <NarrativeText>Case #: 23-MSP-040423     This event was recorded body-worn camera and all video requests can be emailed to Sgt. Twardowski at joseph.twardowski@maryland.gov.    Defendant: Claudine SINGLETARY  Date of Birth: 09/01/1956  Date of Incident: Nov 15, 2023  Time of Incident: 0713 hours  MD License #: S524119001681  Address: 3617 Fords Lane, #225 Baltimore MD, 21215  Phone number: 443-447-3017   Victim: Gloria Wiggam  Date of Birth: 09/19/1997  Date of Incident: Nov 15, 2023  Time of Incident: 0713 hours  MD License #: W250282368726   Narrative:  On 11/15/2023 at approximately 0750 hours, I Trooper Pezold ID 7512 with the Maryland State Police was dispatched to 1111 Reisterstown Road, Pikesville MD, Maryland State Police Headquarters, Licensing Division, to investigate a second degree assault against a Maryland State Police employee -Gloria Wiggam DOB 09/19/1997- that occurred at approximately 0713 hours in the overflow parking lot for Licensing Division.  I arrived at approximately 0820 hours and met with the duty officer Sgt.Barnes and was escorted to a conference room to meet with Wiggam. I identified myself and asked if Wiggam needed medical attention, at which time she declined needing medical assistance.  Wiggam stated that her Aunt Claudine SINGLETARY had been harassing her about her boyfriend via email and text message recently and that SINGLETARY stated she knew where Wiggam lived and worked and that Wiggam couldnt block or ignore her communications.  Wiggam arrived at the MSP parking lot at approximately 0710 hours and observed that SINGLETARY was parked across the street. At approximately 0713 hours Wiggam exited her vehicle and was approached by SINGLETARY, who was yelling and screaming at Wiggam. SINGLETARY crossed the street and closed the distance to Wiggam, continuing to yell and scream at Wiggam. SINGLETARY then used her right hand and made the shape of a gun with her right index finger and thumb, at which time SINGLETARY pressed this hand shaped gun with the right index finger to the forehead of Wiggam and applied enough continual force to push Wiggam backwards and pin Wigman to the driver side of her car. Wiggam made no attempt to fight back, and was able to break free of the pinning and walk into the Maryland State Police Licensing Division building. Wiggam stated that she wanted to press charges and have a Protective Order filed against SINGLETARY.  I escorted Wiggman to the Catonsville District Court at approximately 1000 hours so that she could file the Protective Order. A Protective Order was issued at approximately 1100 hours. I escorted Wiggam back to MSP Licensing.  At approximately 1436 hours I arrived at 3617 Fords Lane #215, Baltimore MD, which is a retirement community. I ran an MVA check on SINGLETARY and discovered that she owned a 2016 black Chevrolet Cruze with a registration plate of 2FH9244. I observed this vehicle parked out front in the community parking lot.  I made contact with the facility manager Ms. Aneita, and asked if she knew SINGLETARY. Aneita confirmed that she knew SINGLETARY and that she was the only resident in #215. Aneita stated that SINGLETARY had a habit of not answering the door when she got herself into trouble. Aneita stated that she knew SINGLETARY wouldnt answer the door.  I attempted contact with SINGLETARY by knocking continually on her door. After approximately 10 mins I heard movement inside the residence. I increased my volume through the door stating that I could hear SINGLETARY moving around. SINGLETARY eventually made short verbal contact through the door from inside the residence saying yeah, what do you want after I said her name and that I wasnt going anywhere. Afterwards SINGLETARY ceased additional verbal communication but continued to make small movements within the residence. I documented the failed contact attempt of the Protection Order and brought the documentation back to the Golden Ring Barracks. I was later informed by Wiggam that the family had spoken to SINGLETARY who stated that she was home when I was attempting service of the Protection Order at the residence and that SINGLETARY was not going to open or answer the door.  Upon arrival at the barrack I met with our Emergency Dispatcher to input the Protection Order into NCIC/METERS. It was discovered that the Baltimore County Police Department had been issued the Protection Order for service by the court and input the information into the system. I made contact with BCPD who did not have a copy of the Protection Order. I faxed them the copy provided to me by the court and they confirmed receipt.  I request this case remain open pending criminal charges.  All events occurred in Baltimore County MD.     </NarrativeText>
