         <NarrativeText>BWC AND IN-CAR CAMERA NOT OPERATIONAL, B-23  SCENE PROCESSING:I contacted the complainant via telephone and obtain his verbal statement of the incident. I requested the complainant to complete a MSP Written Statement (Form 76). The complainant advised he did not wish to complete the form, and did not want to testify to the alleged crime.  COMPLAINANT:William Wayne Beezal Jr. (W/M 12/10/1998)  ATTACHMENTS:MVA Printouts  NARRATIVE:    On 02/03/2023 at approximately 0916 hours, Maryland State Police (MSP) dispatched received a call about an altercation. MSP advised the complainant requested to be contacted via telephone. I then contacted the complainant,William Wayne Beezel Jr. (W/M 12/10/1998) via telephone.    I asked William what happened. William advised he was cut off by a black Honda 4-door passenger car bearing VA registration. William provided two possible VA registration numbers for the vehicle, TVE6640 and TVE6648. William advised after the vehicle cutt him off they became stationary in the intersection in-front of the Rutters gas station (MD 194, and Glade Blvd) Walkersville MD 21793. William advised the driver door opened to the other vehicle, and he then exited his vehicle. William advised a verbal argument then ensued between him and the other driver. William advised he observed the other driver holding a fix blade knife, approximately 7-10 inches in length. William advised the man was holding the knife down against his right leg in his right hand. William advised the subject stated, what the fuck you getting out of your truck for, I will stab you. William advised he wasnt yelling or swinging. William advised they both then got back into their vehicles. William advised the subject followed him for some time, but eventually traveled another direction. I asked William if the subject swung or pointed the knife at him, and he advised no.    William described the subject as a black male, approximately 30 years old, 170lbs, 508, and short black hair. William advised the vehicle was a 4-Door Honda passenger car, black wheels, and had a left taillight inoperable. William could not provide any further characteristics.  William then advised he did not want to pursue criminal charges, and he wanted to make police aware of the incident. I asked William if he would complete a written statement, and he refused. William advised he did not want to testify in court. I asked William several times if he wanted criminal charges pursued, and he advised no. William advised if he would come across the subject again he would then pursue charges. I advised William an Incident Report will be completed and provided him with the case number.    It should be noted the registered owners of the VA registration numbers provided by William do not match his description provided of the subject holding the knife.     I then screened the case with D/Sgt. Stein #3033.    CASE STATUS: This case is closed due to victim denying prosecution.  All events occurred in Frederick County MD. </NarrativeText>
