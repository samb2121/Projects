         <NarrativeText>Q-13 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN IN CAR CAMERA THE EVENT WAS AUDIBLY AND VISUALLY RECORDED Defendant: Caldwell, Tikia Marie (1/F, DOB: 08/06/1992) Date of Birth: 08/06/1992 Time of Arrest: 2355 hours DUI#: 23-116  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On May 17th, 2023, at approximately 2314 hours, I, Trooper Fleming #7439 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, was dispatched to a motor vehicle collision in the area of eastbound US Route 50 at Columbia Park Road, Capitol Heights, Prince Georges County, Maryland. I was in full uniform operating a marked patrol vehicle Q-13. The incident was audibly and visually recorded on my body worn camera. Prior to my arrival, I was informed that a driver was trying to flee the scene. Upon my arrival, I observed a white Nissan Rogue bearing the Maryland registration 2EV0543 approximately 20 feet off road with its drivers side against the left shoulder guardrail. There was a male standing next to the front passengers side corner of the vehicle. I exited my patrol vehicle and my contact with the individual. He informed me that he was inside the vehicle, but he had not been the driver. I asked him where the driver was. He pointed towards the ramp from eastbound US Route 50 to Columbia Park Road. The man appeared to be highly impaired. He was swaying as he stood in place, his speech was mumbled and slurred, his movements were slow and lethargic, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and there was a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and person. I asked the man to sit on the guardrail and wait for me to return. I went to the bottom of the ramp from eastbound US Route 50 to Columbia Park Road where Fireboard and EMS was stationed. I asked EMS personnel where the driver was. They pointed to a woman stumbling up the ramp with a purse in hand. There were two EMS personnel walking alongside her shouting at her. One EMS employee was walking ahead of the woman while holding out his right arm towards her and appeared to be trying to stop or slow her. I had the ambulance to drive me to the top of the ramp so that I could speak with the driver. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I informed the barrack that I would be making contact with an unknown African American female. Upon exiting the front passengers seat of the ambulance, the woman bent over with her hands on her knees and began to audibly cry. The woman apologized and stated that she just wants to go home. The woman stumbled backwards and had a seat on the right shoulder guardrail before slipping and sitting on the curb. The woman claimed that she was not driving. I asked the woman for her drivers license. The woman began to rummage through her purse. I noticed that the woman took a plastic card in placed it under the left strap of her bra. The drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Her movements were slow and lethargic. Her speech was mumbled. There was a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. The woman began to put items back inside her purse, stood up, and stated that she was going home and I put my right arm on her right shoulder to steady the driver as she stood up. The driver claimed that I did not have the right to keep her there. The driver began to argue further and attempted to walk past me. I again put my right arm on her right shoulder to stop her from walking forwards. The driver stumbled backwards. The driver continued to argue and insist that she could go home despite me telling her that she could not. The driver swayed towards me. I grabbed her left shoulder to keep her from falling over. The driver continued to argue and said Im leaving, goodbye. The driver walked past me up the ramp. I stepped in front of her, grabbed her right upper arm with my right arm and then her left arm with my left arm to stop the woman from fleeing. The woman pushed my right arm away from her. The woman said Why you doing this? Call em! and tapped my chest with her index finger. I grabbed the drivers right arm, put it behind her back, and grabbed her left arm. The driver took a couple steps forward and attempted to pull away from me before EMS personnel stopped her. I put handcuffs on the driver. The driver then shouted Wheres my bag? Get my shit!. I sat the woman back down on the curb. The woman began to insist that she was not driving and that her friend Brad was. I informed the barrack that I had the woman detained. The woman asked me if she could reach inside her bag to get something to smoke. She then said I dont even smoke. Im in DC and I dont even smoke. The woman didnt have any cigarettes inside her purse. The driver began ask me to tell the ambulance that she could not breathe. The driver stood up and I grabbed her left arm to secure her. One EMS employee grabbed the drivers purse. The woman shouted Grab all of my shit!. The purse was all that the driver was carrying with her. The driver stepped onto the first stair of the ambulance. The driver turned around and shouted Get the fuck off of me bitch! Get off of me!. An EMS employee on the ambulance shouted Maam! The driver shouted back Aint no Maam!. Another EMS employee asked Do you want help? The driver shouted No!. The driver refused to sit down in the ambulance. The driver walked towards me to exit the ambulance. The driver exited the ambulance of her own accord and sat down on the curb again. As the driver sat down, she started to fall backwards. The driver began to lean backwards and lay in the grass. The driver again began to argue with me and insist that she was not driving. The driver attempted to stand up. I grabbed the drivers shoulders and pushed her down with enough force so that she could not stand up. The driver said You know Im recording you, so why are you getting aggressive?. The driver did not have access to any recording devices. The driver attempted to stand up. I again grabbed the drivers shoulders and pushed her down with enough force so that she could not stand up. The driver continued to attempt to stand up, so I held her left shoulder down with my right arm. The driver said Get the fuck Give me a warrant! Give me a reason for arrest! Do not keep touching me! The driver rolled over to her knees and stood up. I grabbed her arm and waist to sit her back down. The driver turned towards me and stumbled backwards. The driver tripped over the curb and fell backwards. The driver again attempted to stand up. The driver continued to shout aggressively and pull away from me multiple times. The driver stumbled around. I had to grab the driver on several occasions to keep her from falling over. Another police unit arrived on scene. The other trooper grabbed the driver to secure her from fleeing. As he grabbed her, the driver shouted Youre still touching me. Why are you touching me! while looking directly at me. I was not touching the driver at the time. I then determined that the driver would be transported back to the scene of the collision via ambulance. The driver was restrained to a gurney for her own safety during transport. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) Caldwell to was not asked to perform field sobriety due to her aggressive and hostile demeanor. Caldwell appeared to be in good physical condition. Caldwell displayed some minor swelling to her forehead. HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (REFUSED) WALK AND TURN TEST (REFUSED) ONE-LEG STAND TEST (REFUSED)  ARREST Based on the totality of circumstances, I concluded Caldwell was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Caldwell confirmed that she had been inside a vehicle involved in a collision. Caldwell had slight swelling to her forehead and white powder from the deployed airbags on her legs due to being inside the vehicle during the collision. Three witnesses identified Caldwell as the driver of the white Nissan Rogue. The white Nissan Rogue is registered to Caldwell. Caldwell was unable to maintain designated lane directions. The strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Caldwells breath and person. Caldwells eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Caldwell swaying as she stood in place. Caldwells stumbling and lack of balance. Caldwells slow and lethargic movements. Caldwells mumbled speech. Caldwells aggressive and hostile nature. Caldwells forgetfulness and incoherent thought process. Caldwell was walking away from and was attempting to flee the scene of the collision. Caldwell refused to provide any identification or a name and date of birth despite having a Maryland Identification Card on her person. An empty glass bottle of white wine was located under the passengers seat of Caldwells vehicle. The glass bottle was within arms reach of Caldwell and her passenger. On May 17th, 2023, at approximately 2355 hours, I placed the driver under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I immediately notified the barrack. A search incident to arrest of Caldwells person was conducted. The search of Caldwells person was negative. I located a Maryland Identification Card inside the left side of the drivers bra. I identified the driver as Caldwell, Tikia Marie (1/F, DOB: 08/06/1992). Myself and other units on scene attempted to place Caldwell in the front passengers seat of my patrol vehicle. Caldwell refused to fully sit inside the vehicle and face her body to the front of the vehicle. Caldwell would also attempt to stand up and straighten her body to avoid being placed in the vehicle. Caldwell began to kick at myself and the other troopers. Caldwell would also hold down the seatbelt release in order to prevent the seatbelt from latching. While attempting to place the seatbelt on Caldwell, she bit the back of my neck and my right forearm. Caldwell attempted to bite another trooper and myself multiple times. Caldwell would claim that she was not resisting arrest while actively resisting. Caldwell also threatened myself and the other troopers on scene multiple times. I had another trooper sit directly behind Caldwell and restrain Caldwell for her own safety while transporting her. I transported Caldwell to the College Park Barrack. When placing Calwell inside a holding cell and removing the handcuffs, Caldwell attempted to kick me once again. Caldwell again threatened me. Caldwell was read the DR-15 Advice of Rights in English. Caldwell was not provided with a copy of the DR-15 to read along with due to her aggressive and hostile nature. At approximately 0136 hours, Caldwell refused to take an alcohol concentration test. Caldwells vehicle was towed by Gregs Towing. I processed Caldwell and released her to the custody of Upper Marlboro DOC at approximately 0920 hours. The front passenger in Caldwells vehicle was identified as Harris, Bradrick Jordan (1/M; DOB: 02/17/1987). A witness to the collision was identified as Surowicz, Christal Maria (2/F; DOB: 09/10/1963). Surowicz claimed that the white Nissan Rogue was driving recklessly and weaving in and out of traffic prior to the collision. A victim of the collision was identified as Henderson, Claude Andre via his Maryland Drivers License (1/M; DOB: 07/16/1960). Henderson stated that the white Nissan Rogue had sideswiped his vehicle before driving off road to the right and striking the guardrail and then travelling off road to the left and striking another guardrail face. All three witnesses were interviewed on scene by troopers. All three witnesses identified Caldwell as the driver of the white Nissan Rogue.

         <NarrativeText>On 05/17/2023 at approximately 2335 hours, I, Trooper Stallings #7589 was dispatched to assist Trooper Fleming with a two vehicle accident and DUI arrest on Eastbound John Hanson Highway at Columbia Park Rd, Cheverly, Prince Georges County, Maryland.   Upon my arrival at 2349 hours, I observed a white Nissan Rogue bearing Maryland registration 2EV0543 on the left shoulder of Eastbound John Hanson Highway prior to Columbia Park Rd up against the guardrail. Shortly after arriving on scene, I learned that the driver of the Nissan Rogue was attempting to flee the scene of the accident. The driver was later identified as Tikia Marie Caldwell (DOB 08/06/1992). Caldwell had fled up the ramp to Columbia Park Rd from Eastbound John Hanson Highway but Trooper Fleming made contact with Caldwell and detained her at approximately 2340 hours. This prompted me to go on foot and travel up the Columbia Park Rd ramp to assist Trooper Fleming. Upon making contact with Trooper Fleming and Caldwell, I observed Caldwell in handcuffs, actively resisting arrest. Caldwell was officially placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2355 hours. Caldwell was then placed on a stretcher by EMS personnel and escorted into the ambulance. Caldwell, Trooper Fleming, and myself were then transported by the ambulance back down to the original scene of the collision.   Upon placing Caldwell in the front passenger seat of Trooper Flemings patrol vehicle per MSP policy, Caldwell continued to actively resist arrest and refused to stay within the vehicle. Caldwell unrestrained her seatbelt many times in an attempt to exit the vehicle. In the process of securing Caldwell in the front seat, Caldwell attempted to bite Trooper Fleming and I. I sustained no injuries, however, Trooper Fleming was bit on the back of her neck and left forearm. I then attempted to restrain Caldwells legs with a strip of gauze that was provided to me by the ambulance personnel, however, these attempts were not successful. I then used open hand techniques to control Caldwells legs in order to safely secure them within the vehicle. I also placed my right foot in the door frame to prohibit Caldwell from kicking her legs outside the vehicle. After securing Caldwell in the front seat of Trooper Flemings patrol vehicle, I then rode in the rear seat of the vehicle as we safely transported Caldwell to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack for processing. Caldwell incurred no injuries from the encounter.   All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
