         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>this case was captured on Master Trooper Hagans Body Worn Camera.  On October 17th, 2023 at 2316 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police JFK Highway Barrack were dispatched a first degree assault with a firearm call for service at Martin Blvd and Route 40 Pulaski Highway.  Upon arrival, Troopers met with Baltimore County Police Officer Zappardino #6297 in regard to the assault. It was learned on October 17, 2023, at approximately 2220 hours, the Baltimore County Police received a 911 call for a individual who reported their vehicle was struck by gun fire on Interstate 95. Jonathan FRANKENBERGER advised he was on Interstate 95 when a vehicle approached his vehicle and he heard a loud pop consistent with gun fire. FRANKENBERGER also heard the sound of breaking plastic inside his vehicle. FRANKENBERGER observed the suspect vehicle and described it as a dark-colored Nissan Altima with a Nissan decal on the bottom of the doors. The suspect vehicle left the area after the shooting. FRANKENBERGER traveled to 8601 Honeygo Blvd, Whitemarsh Maryland and pulled into a convenience store. While at the store, FRANKENBERGER observed his rear drivers side door had what he described as a bullet hole in it. The trajectory of the projectile entering FRANKENBERGERs vehicle was in a direct path with a childs safety seat. There was no child in the seat the time of the firearm discharge. FRANKENBERGER subsequently notified law enforcement and Baltimore County Police dispatch sent out a BOLO for the suspect vehicle description.  Officer Zappardino advised K9-13 Officer Pierce #5441 of the Baltimore County Police Department was in the area of Bobs Auto located at 1101 Middle River Rd Essex, Maryland. Officer Pierce located a dark blue Nissan Altima with Nissan decals on the door displaying Maryland registration plates of A359389. Officer Pierce knew this vehicle matched the description of the BOLO given prior in regard to an individual firing a firearm at a victim located on I-95. The vehicle, now leaving Bobs Auto was followed by Officer Peirce until additional units were available to conduct a felony stop. Baltimore County Police performed a felony traffic stop on the vehicle in the area of Martin Blvd and Route 40 (Pulaski Highway), Essex Maryland. Officer Zappardino advised they detained the driver of the vehicle, Albadee Asim EDWARDS, a black male with a date of birth of September 25, 1991. There were no other occupants in the vehicle at the time of the felony stop. During a probable cause search of the vehicle, Baltimore County Officers did not locate any firearms but did locate firearm accessories. Officer Pierce returned to Bobs Auto and located two firearms under a vehicle in the parking lot. The firearms were described as a Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 caliber pistol with a serial number of KHL3141 and a High Point C9 9mm pistol with a serial number of P10087299. Both of these firearms had loaded magazines inserted into the firearm with no round in the chamber. The Smith and Wesson had an extended magazine which could hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. A cursory search of the Maryland Automated Firearms Services System (MAFSS) revealed both of these guns were purchased by and listed to EDWARDS.  Based on the description of the vehicle, the proximity in time and location, and the locating of firearms and firearm accessories connected to EDWARDS, EDWARDS was taken into custody by Baltimore County Police for the assault. While interviewing FRANKENBERGER, it was determined the shooting of his vehicle took place on Interstate 95 around the 81 mile marker which would place the incident occurring in Harford County, Maryland. Due to the jurisdictional issue, the Maryland State Police JFK Highway Barrack Trooper and Master Trooper Hagan of the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Northern Region responded and assumed the investigation.  EDWARDS was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for Processing. While there, EDWARDS was read his rights under Miranda and agreed to waive his rights and speak with Master Trooper Hagan. During this interview, EDWARDS admitted to being a mental health consumer suffering from bipolar and depression. EDWARDS advised he does not take the medication he is prescribed but self-medicates with illegal substances purchased on the street. EDWARDS advised he is a daily user of Percocet which he illegally purchases. EDWARDS stated he was driving on the highway all day long and his firearms were in the vehicle while he drove. EDWARDS was extremely paranoid and advised he has been followed for several days by some bad guys. EDWARDS stated he was tired of being followed. EDWARDS admitted to owning and possessing both the Hi Point and Smith and Wesson handguns in the vehicle as he was driving on October 17, 2023. When asked if his firearms had been discharged in the last 24 hours, EDWARDS advised they have. EDWARDS was adamite the High Point firearm has never been fired but he refused to admit the Smith and Wesson was fired today. EDWARDS admitted one of his firearms was used to shoot at another vehicle but refused to admit he did it. However; EDWARDS could not provide the identity of any other person in the vehicle. EDWARDS subsequently invoked his rights and requested to be done with the interview. EDWARDS was returned to his holding cell.  Investigation into EDWARDS and his status to carry a firearm in Maryland was conducted through the Maryland Gun Center. EDWARDS was deemed to not be prohibited from possessing firearms and did not have a Maryland issued handgun permit at the time of the incident.  Both FRANKENBERGER and EDWARDS vehicles were stored and transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for Processing.  EDWARDS was charged with Assault 1st degree, Reckless endangerment and various firearm related charges. EDWARDS was transported to the Harford County IPC and was released into their custody pending an initial appearance with a District Court Commissioner.  The firearms and other items of evidence seized in this investigation were packaged per agency policy and placed into the property room of the JFK Highway Barrack.  The Harford County States Attorneys Office was notified and briefed on this case.  On 10/18/2023, Master Trooper Hagan authored a search and seizure warrant for the suspect vehicle, a 2010 Nissan Altima. This warrant was reviewed and signed by Judge Ishak of Harford County.  On 10/18/2023, at approximately 0907 hours, this warrant was executed on the vehicle at the Golden Ring Barrack. While conducting a search of the vehicle, Master Trooper Hagan discovered a large quantity of illegal drugs and US currency. Master Trooper Hagan contacted Sgt. Hodgin of MSP Northern Narcotics. Sgt. Hodgin mobilized his team, assisted Master Trooper Hagan with completing the search warrant and assisted with the packaging of the drugs and money. Northern Narcotics opened a separate investigation into the suspect for possession with intent to distribute CDS based off the findings from this search warrant.  Crime scene techs from MSP FSD conducted a forensic exam of the victims vehicle. The CST ultimately determined the trajectory of the round entered the drivers side rear door, passed through the interior portion of the door and struck the child safety seat (Booster) striking one arm, traveling through it and terminating on the other arm. Had a child been in this seat, or any other person, they would have been struck by the projectile. This examination by CSTs was conducted via a consent search from the victim.  Master Trooper Hagan contacted the Harford County IPC and determined EDWARDS was held without bail.  Case Closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On October 17, 2023, at approximately 2316hours, I, Trooper Payne #7368 from the Maryland State Police assigned to the JFK Barrack, was dispatched to respond to 8601 Honeygo Blvd. make contact with the victim of a reported first degree assault. Upon my arrival, I made contact with assisting Baltimore County Police officers and the victim, Jonathan Frankenberger (W/M 07/29/1982), later identified by his Maryland drivers license. Frankenberger advised that he was not injured, however he noticed a bullet hole in the left rear passenger side of his vehicle, a black Audi A6 bearing MD registration T1513061. I asked Frankenberger to complete a written statement, which he agreed. Upon questioning, Frankenberger stated that while traveling southbound I-95, south of mile marker 85, he noticed a Nissan Altima pacing his vehicle for several miles. Frankenberger then stated that around southbound I-95 approaching mile marker 81, the driver of the Nissan Altima then changed from lanes 1 to 2, then shot at his vehicle while he was traveling in lane 3. Frankenberger mentioned that the suspect also shot at a white SUV. The white SUV took exit 80 after the encounter. Frankenberger continued to follow the suspects vehicle at a safe distance until the vehicle took exit 67. Frankenberger contacted the Baltimore County Police department then waited for an officer to meet him at a safe location.  I transported Frankenberger and followed his towed vehicle to the Golden Ring barrack for further processing. After the initial investigation concluded at the Golden Ring Barrack, I transported Frankenberger to his residence and provided him with the case number and a Maryland Crime Victims and Witness Pamphlet.
