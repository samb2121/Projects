         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report (For review by the MSPCrash Team)   SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION On Thursday, March 2, 2023, at approximately 2017 hours, the Montgomery County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) notified the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack for a reported motorcycle collision involving an occupant that sustained suspected life-threatening injuries. It was reported that the collision occurred on the ramp from the northbound side of Dwight D. Eisenhower Highway (I-270) to West Montgomery Avenue (MD 28). I, Trooper First Class (TFC) Wen Shu #6755, a Collision Reconstruction Specialist (CRS) assigned to the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack, was requested to be the lead investigator for the collision reconstruction. I arrived on the scene at approximately 2024 hours.  Upon my arrival, I made contact with TFC Jason Reid #7215 who was on thescene to assist with the investigation. Members of the State Highway Administration Coordinated Highways Action Response Team (CHART)were on the scene assisting with lane closures. The entire ramp was closed for investigation purposes.  After conducting a brief investigation, it was determined that the collision involved following vehicle and occupant:   A Black 2009 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide Ultra Classic motorcycle being operated by Ramil Vembu (DOB: 7/18/1964)  Ramil Vembu was transported to Suburban Hospital for life-threatening injuries by Ambulance 703 as a priority 1 patient.  The investigation will address various elements that causedand/or contributed to the collision.   SECTION 2: SCENE DESCRIPTION PRIMARY ROADWAY: Dwight D. Eisenhower Highway (I-270) is a State of Maryland Department of Transportation maintained roadway that is constructed of asphalt. Dwight D. Eisenhower Highway (I-270) was a divided highway that traveled in a north/south direction in the area of the collision. The northbound lane of the ramp from Dwight D. Eisenhower Highway (I-270) to W. Montgomery Ave (MD 28) consisted of a single travel lane in this area and was approximately 900 feet south of the W. Montgomery Ave (MD 28). It also consisted of a fully paved right shoulder and a fully paved narrow left shoulder.  The right edge of the roadway was marked by a single, solid white lane line and aligned with a concrete traffic barrier. The left edge of the roadway was marked with a single, solid white lane line and aligned with guardrails. There was gore area with guardrails and tree brushes in between the northbound local lanes of I-270 and the ramp lane. In the area where the collision occurred, the ramp of Dwight D. Eisenhower Highway (I-270) was essentially curving right and level. The posted speed limit was 55 miles-per-hour. There were no sight limitation or view obstruction in the area which may have contributed to the collision.At the time of the collision, traffic was medium in volume as it was around 8 pm. The roadway was dry.  SECONDARY ROADWAY:  There was no secondary roadway involving in the collision.  TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICE:  There were painted roadway markings.  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS:  On March 2nd, 2023, at approximately 2017 hours, the collision occurred during evening hours and the weather consisted of a cloudy sky with a surface temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to the time of day and the cloudy sky,it was not believed that sun glare could have contributed to this collision.  SECTION 3: SCENE EVIDENCE  The black Harley-Davidson Electra Glide Ultra Classic motorcycle stopped approximately 180 feet north of initial impact point facing northeast. The Harley-Davidson Classic sustained minor damages mostly on its left side. I observed visible scratch damages on the left side front pillar and rear muffler. The left side peddle was covered with grass and dirt. Dirt could also be found at the bottom of the motorcycle. Pre-impact skid marks were hardly visible on the asphalt surface. However, I was able to discover tire tread marks imprinted on the grassy surface off the roadway to the left. I noticed suspected blood stains appeared approximately 50 feet north of the initial impact point on the left shoulder as well as on one of the support pillars of the guardrail off the left shoulder. There was a good amount of dirt, grass and several personal items including a black shirt scattered between the suspected blood stains and the initial impact point.   The scene was documented with digital photographs and hand measurements.  SECTION 4: VEHICLE(S) INVOLVED  VEHICLE 1:  Registration:25733Y - Maryland Vehicle Identification Number: 1HD1FC4149Y635744 Registration Status: Valid Make: Harley-Davidson Model: Electra Glide Ultra Classic Year: 2009 Examination: The black Harley-Davidson Electra Glide ultra Classic displayed minor damages on left side and bottom of the motorcycle.    SECTION 5: PERSON(S) INVOLVED  DECEASED (OPERATOR OF VEHICLE 1): Name:Ramil Vembu Date of Birth:07/18/1964 Operator License Number: V510730805567 (MD) License Status: Licensed Address: 702 Azalea Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 Phone Number: None Injury Severity: Fatal EMS Run Number: 2300027172 Impairment: None detected   SECTION 6: FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION  R Adam Cowley Shock Trauma Center contacted Rockville Barrack on 3/6 at 1359 hours advising that the operator of vehicle 1 passed away under emergency care.   SECTION 7: REVIEW OF REPORTS FILED BY OTHER AGENCIES / INVESTIGATORS None   SECTION 8: ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULES The black Harley-Davidson Electra Glide Ultra Classic motorcycle was installed with an electronic control module (ECM) that was not supported by Bosch Crash Data Retrieval software.    SECTION 9: SPEED ANALYSIS  The speed analysis was not conducted due to insufficient evidence associated with the crash.   SECTION 10: CRASH DYNAMICS  The black Harley-Davidson Electra Glide Ultra Classic motorcycle was traveling north on the ramp from the northbound side of IS-270 to West Montgomery Avenue (MD 28) in lane number 1. The Harley-Davidson traveled off the left shoulder onto the grassy area for approximately 10 feet and struck the guardrail with its front left side forks. The Harley-Davidson began to fall toward its left side at which time the driver was partially ejected toward the guardrail off the left shoulder. Once the driver was fully ejected, he landed between the grassy area and left shoulder asphalt surface, and soon struck one of the guardrail support pillars with his neck. The driver continued sliding north along the white lane line and came to his final rest position approximately 50 feet away from the initial impact point between the motorcycle and the guardrail. The left side peddle of the Harley-Davidson struck the ground causing the motorcycle to recover from its tilting position. The Harley-Davidson kept traveling northeast on the ramp while being driver-less and struck the concrete traffic barrier on the left shoulder with its front left side forks roughly 128 feet north of its initial impact point. The Harley-Davidson then veered toward its right and traveled across the entire ramp. The Harley-Davidson came to its uncontrollable final rest position on right shoulder curb standing straight up facing northeast.
