Distinguished graduate of the University of Maryland DUI Institute Session XV in June, 2023.  Certified as Intoximeter EC/IR II operator in July, 2023.   NARRATIVE:  On October 8, 2023 at approximately 0451 hours, I was on duty and in uniform operating marked MSP vehicle DUI-5. I was on routine patrol in the area of the Outer Loop I-695 at Security Boulevard, Baltimore County, Maryland, when I first observed the suspect vehicle.  At the time of the incident, I was assisting with traffic control for a separate unrelated crash. As a result of the other crash, there was a major backup in traffic. After the initial crash was cleaned up, we began to open the roadway and allow cars in the backup to begin moving past the crash scene. After the vehicles began clearing, I observed several vehicles were stopped in lane 4 behind the suspect vehicle, which was the lead vehicle in the line of stopped cars. I began to approach the stopped vehicles and began clearing them one-by-one until I made my way to the suspect vehicle, which was a black Nissan Maxima bearing Maryland registration 9DY7101.  PHASE 1: VEHICLE IN MOTION  Due to the nature of the incident, I did not observe the vehicle in motion.  PHASE 2: PERSONAL CONTACT  I first made a passenger side approach to the vehicle to make contact with the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle. When I approached the vehicle, I observed the driver was sitting upright in the driver seat with his head down and eyes closed, appearing to be in a deep sleep. The vehicle was on and running in park, with the drivers foot on the brake. I also observed there were several open and empty Modelo beer cans in plain view that were scattered around the passenger compartment of the vehicle. As I began to knock on the passenger side window, the driver was not responding and continued sleeping. I also attempted to open the door to the vehicle, but observed they were locked.   After making my initial observations, I made my way to the driver side of the vehicle and began knocking on the window to get the drivers attention. After knocking for several seconds, I was eventually able to wake the driver. When the driver woke up, he looked towards me and appeared groggy, confused, and disoriented while looking towards me with a blank stare. As the driver was staring at me, I began shouting at him to turn his vehicle off while attempting to open his door. As I was shouting to the driver to turn his vehicle off, he began making lethargic movements towards the ignition button, but then put his foot on the brake and shifted his vehicle into drive. As I began to yell louder at the driver and banged on his window, he then rolled the window down and stated, OK, before then staring forward. As I continued to order the driver to turn the vehicle off, he began to ignore my requests which forced me to reach inside the vehicle and turn it off out of safety concerns.   As I was reaching into the passenger compartment of the vehicle, I detected the overbearingly heavy odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. As I attempted to speak with the driver, I noticed his speech was slow and slurred, and he also had a Hispanic accent. When I asked the driver why he was stopped in the road, he mentioned the previous crash but the traffic had been cleared for several minutes at that point. When I asked the driver about how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that night, he stated, Im home.   When I asked the driver for his license, he began making slow movements towards his back wallet to retrieve his wallet. When he removed his wallet, he began to slowly look through the pockets before stating, I dont know. The driver further stated that he did not have any other identifying documents or the registration card for the vehicle with him.   As I spoke with the driver, I detected the heavy odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath as he spoke. I further observed his eyes were bloodshot and glossy, his speech was heavily slurred, he was drowsy with droopy eyelids, and he was disoriented and lethargic. Based on my observations, I asked the driver to exit the vehicle and speak with me further. When I approached the vehicle the second time to ask the driver to exit, he was then holding a cell phone out of the window with the screen facing me to record me. I explained to the driver that he could continue to record me while he exited the vehicle, which he did. As the driver began to exit the vehicle, he used his hand on the B-pillar of the vehicle to push himself out of the vehicle and towards me while also dropping his wallet on the ground. As the driver moved towards me, he moved the phone closer towards my face while asking for my name after I had already provided it to him. The driver also did not realize he dropped his wallet and I put it back into the car.   After the driver stepped onto the shoulder, I asked again what his name was. The driver provided the name of Filemon Blanco. When I asked the driver for his date of birth, he stated that he did not know how to say it in English. At that point, I began using the Google Translate app on my phone in an attempt to better communicate with the driver. Using the app to ask the driver again for his birthday, he first only gave me a year. After asking a second time for his whole birthday, he then only provided the day. Finally, after asking a third time, the driver provided a month. The driver self-identified as Filemon Blanco (H/M DOB: 11/22/1984). The drivers identity was later confirmed to be Filemon Blanco Espinoza (H/M DOB: 11/22/1984) using the MVA Browse function of METERS/NCIC. Filemon Blanco was not forthcoming about his full name, and refused to provide any of the information I requested to confirm his identity. Filemon Blancos license was also later confirmed to be suspended, and he had an active Baltimore County Circuit Court warrant for child support violations. Filemon Blanco also had a prior DUI arrest. When I asked Filemon Blanco how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that night, he stated, three. When I asked Filemon Blanco if that included the three that were in the vehicle, he stated, yeah, and then started talking on his phone. When I asked Filemon Blanco where he was coming from that night, he first stated he was at his house but then stated that he was visiting his baby.  PHASE 3: PRE-ARREST SCREENING  Based on my observations and conversations with Filemon Blanco, I asked him to perform standardized field sobriety tests to confirm he could safely operate a motor vehicle. Filemon Blanco initially agreed to submit to the tests but appeared hesitant and was asking the person he was on the phone with to pick him up. The weather at the time was clear and approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The tests were performed on the right shoulder where the ground was level and free from debris. Filemon Blanco was wearing a tank top shirt, jeans, and laced sneakers at the time. Filemon Blanco stated that he did not wear contacts or glasses, did not have injuries or impairments that affected his balance, did not take any medications, and did not have any recent head injuries. STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS Instructions: The subject is told to stand with their feet together and their arms down at their side. A stimulus (ink pen) is held approximately twelve to fifteen inches from the subjects face, and they are asked to follow the stimulus with their eyes only and not to move their head. Prior to beginning the test, I ask the subject if they understand the instructions. I initially check for equal pupil size, resting nystagmus, and equal tracking. I next check for lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. Finally, I check for vertical nystagmus. Both eyes are checked twice for each clue. Results: 6/6. Filemon Blanco had brown eyes that were bloodshot and glossy. Filemon Blanco initially refused to look at my stimulus and was staring directly at me. Filemon Blanco also attempted to move his head several times, even after being corrected. All clues present and distinct. Vertical gaze nystagmus was not present. Filemon Blanco also displayed an approximate 2-inch circular sway.  WALK AND TURN Instructions: The subject is told to stand with their right foot in front of their left foot in a heel to toe manner. They are told to stay in that position and keep their arms at their side until being told to begin the test. I ask to make sure they understand and then begin explaining and demonstrating the test. The subject is instructed to take nine heel-to-toe steps on a straight, imaginary line. On the ninth step, they are instructed to leave their lead foot planted and take a series of small steps to turn 180 degrees. They are then told to take an additional nine heel-to-toe steps back down the same imaginary line. They are told to watch their feet, count their steps out loud, keep their hands at their side, touch heel-to-toe on every step, and to not stop walking until the test is completed. I then ask if they understand the instructions before having them begin the test. Results:    Cannot Keep Balance:Filemon Blanco stepped out of the starting position several times.  Starts Too Soon: Filemon Blanco attempted to begin the test twice as I was still attempting to explain and demonstrate the test.   Other:As I was attempting to place Filemon Blanco in the instructional position, he demonstrated poor balance and poor coordination. Filemon Blanco struggled to stand in the instructional position for more than a few seconds at a time before he lost his balance and stumbled out of the starting position. This continued several times until Filemon Blanco, No, its OK, and then placed his hands out in front of him as if he knew he was going to be arrested. Filemon Blanco confirmed that he was refusing to complete the remaining tests.   Total Clues: 2/8 ARREST  Based on my observations, as well as my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and Drug Recognition Expert, I placed Filemon Blanco under arrest for driving under the influence at approximately 0456 hours. Filemon Blanco continuously argued that there was an accident, which was why he had stopped. Filemon Blanco also claimed that he believed he was OK to be driving. Filemon Blanco was secured in my vehicle to be transported to the Baltimore County Towson Precinct. Filemon Blancos vehicle was secured on the right shoulder, and his personal belongings were removed from the vehicle to be transported to the precinct with him. As I was securing the vehicle, I observed four empty Modelo beer cans in plain view of the vehicle. Two cans were in the center console cup holder, one can was on the passenger seat in a black plastic bag, and one can was on the front passenger floorboard.  Filemon Blanco was hostile during my entire interaction with him, and often called me a racist. Filemon Blanco was mostly quiet while on the way to the precinct, but did start talking as we got closer to the precinct. Filemon Blanco continued to call me a racist and claim that he did not do anything wrong. The heavy odor of an alcoholic beverage continued emitting from his breath and person as he spoke. We arrived at the Towson precinct at approximately 0524 hours.  After arriving at the Towson precinct, Filemon Blanco was escorted to the DUI processing room and provided a copy of his DR-15 Advice of Rights to follow along as the Spanish recording of the form from the Motor Vehicle Administration Website was played for him. A copy of the Spanish side of the form was placed face up on the table to the left of Filemon Blanco. When I started playing the recording, Filemon Blanco refused to answer if he could hear the form so I played it at maximum volume. While the recording was playing, Filemon Blanco was not looking at the form and did not appear to be following along. After the recoding when I asked Filemon Blanco if he understood the form, he stated that he did not. When I asked Filemon Blanco what he did not understand, he refused to answer. As I continued to ask, Filemon Blanco continued to argue being arrested. After explaining to Filemon Blanco the reasons he was arrested again, he then stated that he understood the form and did not have any questions. Filemon Blanco refused to submit to the alcohol concentration test at approximately 0600 hours. At the time, a certified intoximeter operator was on duty and available at the precinct.  DISPOSITION  Filemon Blanco was transported to the Baltimore County Detention Center for service of his warrant. Filemon Blanco was released to the detention center after being charged accordingly and being provided copies of all appropriate paperwork.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
