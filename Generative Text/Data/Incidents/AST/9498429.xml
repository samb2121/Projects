         <NarrativeText>BODY CAM INITIAL:https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=84731b12b1794238a32bb57273ec3be9partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1 BODY CAM INTERVIEW:https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=92c134729d914e909a484a71fe76e933partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  On 07/18/2023 at approximately 1329 hours, I, TFC Todd 6929, was dispatched to 405 Naylor Mill Road which is the Juvenile Detention Center for a reported overdose. I arrived, and observed a hispanic male later identified as Anthony Israel Mendez Cabrera (01/24/2006 5/M) being loaded into an ambulance. He was awake and alert and EMS stated that Narcan was used and that he was being transported but was otherwise uninjured. I then went inside and made contact with several of the Staff at Lower Shore. They advised me that just prior to them calling 911, Cabrera was found unresponsive from an apparent overdose. They came to this conclusion due to a small bag of eight (8) round blue pills being found under the left foot of Cabrera. I then took possession of the blue pills from an M. Mills who is the case manager at approximately 0156 hours. I took possession of the pills and responded to the barrack for processing. All appropriate paperwork for the CDS has been uploaded to this report and the pills themselves will be sent to the lab for testing.  On 07/19/2023, I responded back to Lower Shore and made contact with Kathy Worth who is the security supervisor. She firstly advised that Cabrera was fine and that he was back at the facility. She then explained to me that she believes his sister, Yasiris Mendez (08/14/2004 5/F) brought the contraband to him the day prior during an art show that family is allowed to visit. She came to this conclusion by a security video that she was beginning to show me. The video has been attached to this report, and after review I observed the following:  The video starts with Cabrera, his sister Mendez, his mother and another sister walking to a table to sit down together in a gymnasium. Mendez left hand is partially closed at the :23 second mark. At the :36 second mark, Cabrera gets up from his seat to retrieve two bags of chips. At this time Mendezs left hand cannot be seen on video. At the :45 second mark, Mendezs left hand is on the table still partially closed. At the 1:15 mark, Cabrera returns to the table with a blue bag of chips for himself and an orange bag for his other sister, and at the 1:27 mark he is opening the sealed bag of chips himself. During this 12-second period, he appears nervous and is looking around him frequently. At the 1:53 mark, Mendez can be seen reaching over to the blue bag of chips, placing her left hand inside and grabbing a single chip. After grabbing the chip, it appears that she looked inside the bag, then slid the bag back to Cabrera. Cabrera eats several more chips from the blue bag, then at the 2:53 mark he reaches inside the bag and takes out something small and white that is clearly not a chip from the bag and appears to inspect the item. At the 2:57 mark he can then be seen dropping the item into his left hand that was placed in his lap. At the 3:09 mark, Cabrera grabs the bag of chips with his left hand and his hand is closed, similarly to how Mendezs was earlier. At the 3:20 mark, Mendez brings his left hand down, and instead of releasing his hand, he makes a complete fist and bring down to his lap under the table. At the 4:07 mark, Cabrera stands up and walks away from Worth. As he walks away, he blades his body away from her unnaturally and places his left clenched hand into his pants pocket. At 4:37 mark, Cabrera can be seen walking back into frame with his left hand un clenched. Throughout the video clip, no other person touched the open blue chip bag other than Cabrera and Mendez. The format of the video is not compatible with RMS, due to this I have burned it onto a CD.  I asked Worth to speak with Cabrera which she allowed, and I met with Cabrera in a private area with Worth in the room. I explained to him that any questions I ask are for information and that I cannot charge him for the possession of the CDS since EMS was called. I asked him how many pills were in the bag, and he stated that there was 10. I asked him what he thought they were, and he said Fent or fentanyl and that he knew what he was doing. I asked him where he found it, and he said the bathroom. He had nothing else to say in regard to the found CDS.  Based on the video evidence, I will be forwarding the case to the States Attorneys Office for recommendations on charges for Mendez if any. I request this case remain open.
