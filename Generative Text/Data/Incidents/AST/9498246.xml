         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING:  A copy of the domestic violence supplement was emailed to the Cecil County Domestic Violence Coordinator. A copy of the supplement, statement of probable cause, statement of charges, and photographs of injuries can be found in Attachments.    I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217), am equipped with a body-worn camera. Interviews with the suspect and victim were recorded audibly and visually via my body-worn camera.  NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK:   Considering the circumstances, a neighborhood check was not conducted.  SUSPECT:    NAME: CAROLYN ELAINE WRIGHT (W/F)   DATE OF BIRTH: AUGUST 23, 1965   MAILING ADDRESS: 408 TASKER LANE P.O. BOX 404, CHARLESTOWN, MD 21914   TELEPHONE: 484-716-7797   MD SOUNDEX: W-623-108-201-658   DATE/TIME OF ARREST: FEBRUARY 7, 2023 @ APPROX. 1815 HOURS  VICTIM:    NAME: STEVEN HAROLD WRIGHT (W/M) DATE OF BIRTH: MARCH 25, 1962 MAILING ADDRESS: 408 TASKER LANE P.O. BOX 404, CHARLESTOWN, MD 21914 TELEPHONE: 484-716-7746  NARRATIVE:  On February 7, 2023 at approximately 1732 hours, I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217) of the Maryland State Police, was advised to make contact with two walk-in subjects at the Maryland State Police North East Barrack in regards to a domestic dispute/second degree assault. I made contact with both subjects at approximately this time. These individuals were identified as Steven Harold Wright (see Victim) and Carolyn Elaine Wright (see Suspect). Steven and Carolyn were separated from one another. I also interviewed them separately.      In the North East Barrack lobby, I made contact with Steven Wright. Steven advised me of the following:     - He and Carolyn are married. The day of this incident is their anniversary.     - He and Carolyn were parked in their vehicle at 75 North East Plaza, North East, Maryland 21901. He was in the drivers seat and she was in the passenger seat. - Steven and Carolyn were arguing, with at least a portion of the argument involving Carolyn accusing Steven of infidelity.     - Steven was telling Carolyn to be quiet, and was pointing his finger at her as he spoke to her.     - Steven said Carolyn then punched him in the right eye.     - Steven drove himself and Carolyn to the Maryland State Police North East Barrack to report the incident/de-escalate the dispute.     While talking to Steven, I observed his right eye was obviously irritated. It was heavily bloodshot and watering. Based on my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, this appeared consistent with someone who suffered a minor eye injury. Steven declined medical treatment when I offered it for his eye.    I then interviewed Carolyn in the North East Barrack conference room. I gathered the following speaking to Carolyn:  - Carolyn and Steven are married. The day of this incident is their anniversary.     - Carolyn and Steven were arguing. Steven was poking at Carolyn.     - Carolyn and Steven were sitting in their vehicle, parked at 75 North East Plaza, North East, Maryland 21901.     - Carolyn put her hands up to get Steven to stop poking her. Steven became more upset.     - Steven attempted to slap Carolyn. Carolyn tried to deflect the slap, which grazed her cheek. She inadvertently poked him in the eye with her cellular phone while attempting to deflect the slap.     - Steven drove himself and Carolyn to the Maryland State Police North East Barrack.     I observed Carolyn had a faint red mark near her left cheek-bone.  I then re-interviewed Steven. Steven told me he may have swung his hand in reaction to Carolyn striking him, but he did not seem to recall if he truly did so or not.    When I re-interviewed Carolyn, she started to seem less sure that Steven actually tried to slap her (she started to describe it as being possible as opposed to a definite fact). She also then said she is unsure if he tried to slap her or if he was just poking at her.     I gathered Steven and Carolyn are still married and are living together at 408 Tasker Lane, Charlestown, Maryland 21914.    I would also note that the injury to Stevens eye is considerably more noticeable/irritated than the faint mark on Carolyns cheek (i.e. Stevens injury appears more severe than hers).    At approximately 1815 hours, I placed Carolyn under arrest at the North East Barrack. I did this for the following reasons:  - Steven and Carolyn both advised they were having an argument.     - Steven accused Carolyn of hitting him in the eye.     - Stevens right eye was noticeably bloodshot and watering, leading me to believe he was hit.     - Carolyn initially accused Steven of attempting to slap her, but on subsequent interview, was unable to confirm if this was actually the case.     - As a result of the dispute/injury to his eye, Steven drove himself and Carolyn to the North East Barrack. If Steven had been the aggressor in this situation, he more likely would not have driven himself to the police.     - Steven and Carolyn are currently married and living together. This incident occurred leading into their walk-in at the North East Barrack.    Based on the totality of the above circumstances, there is probable cause to believe Carolyn assaulted Steven in the second degree. Considering their married status and living arrangement, this is an incident of domestic violence.    I offered Steven the opportunity to complete a domestic violence screening. He declined to be screened. Steven also declined to make a telephone call to a domestic violence counselor when offered.    During processing, two pill bottles were found in Carolyns purse. An attempt was made to identify the pills in said containers. I was unable to identify these pills as being controlled substances not prescribed to Carolyn.    Carolyn was transported to the Cecil County Commissioners Office after processing. The Cecil County Commissioners Office granted probable cause for the charge of second degree assault. A secured bond was set at $3,500.00/100%. Carolyn posted her bond in full and was subsequently released. She was advised to avoid contact with Steven.    I advised both Steven and Carolyn to apply for protection orders. I also told Carolyn she can apply for her own charges at the Cecil County Commissioners Office. I also advised her she can speak to a domestic violence counselor considering what I was able to gather about her and Stevens history. From what I could gather, this was not their first instance of domestic abuse between the two of them,    Case cleared by arrest.    All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
