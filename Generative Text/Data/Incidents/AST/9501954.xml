At 1304 hours, I was dispatched. At 1309 hours, I arrived on scene. Upon arrival on scene, I made contact with the parties involved. Verbal statements gathered on scene. Juvenile suspect charged on scene on MSP Form 53, and released to custody of mother at 1443 hours. I then cleared the scene at approximately 1450 hours.  NARRATIVE: On 10/27/2023, at 1304 hours, I (S/Tpr Blumenauer #6357) of the Maryland State Police was on duty when I was dispatched to the Heritage Farm Park located at 9224 Devilbiss Bridge Road in Walkersville, Frederick County, Maryland in reference to an assault in progress. The 911 caller (Felecia, #240-405-7047) was advising she was at the park and observed a couple actively fighting, a male and a female party. The 911 caller advised the active assault was occurring in the soccer field, with a male beating a female. The 911 caller then advised the couple was moving towards the batting cages inside of the park.   At 1309 hours, I arrived on scene. Upon arrival on scene, I made contact with the 911 caller/complainant/witness involved, who was located to the rear of the batting cages in the rear end of the park. The 911 caller/witness was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Felicia Marie Warfield (DOB 03/06/1993). While speaking with Warfield, she advised she was walking in the park with her husband and infant child when observed two (2) younger parties, a male and a female, who were walking in the soccer field. Warfield advised she saw hand swinging from a distance, and saw a young boy with a dog in close proximity. Warfield advised the mother of one of the parties involved was next to the playground, and pointed to her location. Warfield advised she told her husband to stand by, and then she observed the male juvenile party involved push the female involved. Warfield advised the two parties involved were now in the rear of the field, a 15-year-old male, and a 17-year-old female. I asked Warfield where the parties went, and Warfield advised the male party took off running because he saw the police (Myself, in the marked MSP police vehicle). Warfield advised she observed the male party strike the female party two (2) times with a closed fist in the face, and strike her one (1) time with a closed fist in the stomach. Warfield also the females mother was here on scene with us, and both parties involved were down near the train tracks on the exterior of the park. Warfield advised the mother of the female juvenile was seated in her vehicle when the altercation occurred.  I then made contact with the mother of the female juvenile involved, who was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Tabitha Lynn Crummitt (DOB 04/13/1984). Crummitt advised the male juvenile party had been living with her family. Crummitt advised she was going to call the mother of the male juvenile involved. Crummitt advised her daughter involved was Isabelle Julianne Lucas (DOB 07/07/2006). While speaking with Crummitt, who was also on the phone with the male parties mother, I was able to identify the male party involved as Jason Ryan Sweeney Jr (DOB 01/20/2008). It should be noted, while speaking with Crummitt, it was provided that Lucas (victim) was currently two (2) months pregnant.  At approximately 1317 hours, DFC Bowne #612 of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office arrived on scene to assist. I advised DFC Bowne of the location of the juvenile parties, and asked if he could assist with contacting the parties involved. DFC Bowne the responded to the wood line area behind the soccer field, and made contact with the juveniles involved.   While continuing to speak with Crummitt, I asked her if she witnessed the altercation between Lucas and Sweeney. Crummitt advised she parked her car, and Lucas and Sweeney took their dog to the baseball field area to walk the dog. Crummitt advised Lucas and Sweeney were accompanied with her other two (2) children of hers while walking. Crummitt did advise that Lucas and Sweeney will get into spats, but she has never seen Sweeney strike Lucas. I asked Crummitt how long Lucas and Sweeney had been dating, and Crummitt advised approximately 10 months. Crummitt also confirmed Lucas was currently two (2) months pregnant, and Sweeney was the father of the unborn child. I asked Crummitt if she brought both Lucas and Sweeney to the park on todays date, and she advised she did. I inquired with Crummitt if she observed the altercation, and she advised she did not. I asked Crummitt if she heard Lucas and Sweeney arguing, and she advised she did. I asked Crummitt what Lucas and Sweeney were arguing about, and she advised it could have been related to Lucass job, money, or even pregnancy. Crummitt advised Lucas and Sweeney intentional got pregnant together because it would be a way they could stay together as a couple. At 1321 hours, TFC Rickard #6942 arrived on scene to assist.   At approximately 1323 hours, I was advised by the Frederick County Sheriffs Office (DFC Bowne) that the parties were walking back to the scene. I then made contact with Warfield a second time to gather further details regarding the alleged assault. Warfield was advising she saw two parties walking in the soccer field, later identified as Lucas and Sweeney. Warfield advised she observed Lucas and Sweeney walking further away in the soccer field, and the she observed His (Sweeneys) hands swinging from a distance. Warfield then advised she told her husband to stop a second while walking, because she believed something did not feel right. Warfield then advised she observed Sweeney assault Lucas. Warfield advised I looked, and he (Sweeney) right hook, left hook, and then in her stomach (right hand again). Warfield described the punching motion with her hands while speaking with me. Warfield advised she then began to yell at Sweeney Stop hitting her, stop hitting her! while she was on the phone with the 911 dispatcher. Warfield advised she told the 911 dispatcher to have police sent someone faster, and then she observed Lucas push Sweeney off of her. At approximately 1326 hours, DFC Bowne responded back to my location with Lucas and Sweeney. I then inquired with DFC Bowne if either Lucas or Sweeney made any statements to him regarding the alleged assault. DFC Bowne advised that Lucas and Sweeney both confirmed they got into a verbal argument. DFC Bowne then advised Lucas and Sweeney advised the Lucas struck Sweeney first, and then Sweeney pushed Lucas and stated Im not doing this and then were able to calm down. DFC Bowne then advised either Lucas or Sweeney made a statement of People are trippin, and need to mind their own business. DFC Bowne advised that Lucas did confirm that she was pregnant. DFC Bowne also advised that Sweeney denied ever hitting Lucas during the altercation.    At 1336 hours, I requested EMS to respond to the scene to check on Lucas due to the alleged assault and the fact she was pregnant. At 1345 hours, EMS personnel arrived on scene (Ambulance 248, EMS Run #F23033678). At 1353 hours, Lucas refused EMS treatment, with the approval of her mother, Crummitt. It should be noted, there were no visible injuries to Lucass person. I observed a small scratch on the left outer forearm area of Sweeneys left arm. At approximately 1405 hours, Lucas was released to the custody of her mother, Crummitt on scene.   At approximately 1430 hours, the mother of Sweeney arrived on scene. The mother of Sweeney was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Emily Ramsay Lord (DOB 01/09/1988). At 1432 hours, Sweeney was released to the custody of his mother, Lord on the MSP Form 53 Juvenile Release Form related to the alleged incident.   I advised both legal guardians of the parties involved of the option to file a peace/protective order with the District Court Commissioners Office in Frederick at a future date if they so desired. Both parties involved and their legal guardians were provided my contact information, and case number for the incident.  The MVA records, and MSP Form 53 Juvenile Release Form were added to the attachments section of this report.  All of these events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  CHARGES:    Assault-Sec Degree, CJIS *1_1415*, CR 3-203   CASE STATUS:    I respectfully request this case to be closed by juvenile arrest.   </NarrativeText>
