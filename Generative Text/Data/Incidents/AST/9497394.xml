         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-007654  Incident: CR 3-203: Assault: 2nd degree  Date/ Time: 03/01/2023, 0055 hours  Location of Offense: 1035 Washington Rd, Westminster, Carroll County, MD 21157.  Initial incident was not recorded. My investigation was captured on AXON digital body camera assigned to me.  Attachments:  -MVA information for all parties involved -Statement of Charges  Probable Cause  Training  Qualifications:  -MSP Academy, June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007  C.I.T.: Crisis Intervention Team (Carroll County), (Carroll County Public Safety Training Center, 11/05-11/09/2018)  Victim/ Complainant:  GARY STEVEN RADFORD  GARY RADFORD advised he is the father of the defendant, GARY RADFORD Jr. The victim admitted that his wife, son and he had been drinking in the residence when an argument broke out. The victim stated he was attacked by his son, GARY RADFORD Jr. In the course of the fight, the victim was bitten on the little finger of his left hand by the defendant. The victim got the defendant out of the residence. The defendant then got into his vehicle, damaged the front lawn of the victim by spinning tires, splattering the victim with mud.  Defendant:  GARY STEVEN RADFORD JR  GARY STEVEN RADFORD, Jr, admitted to getting into an argument with his father, admitted to getting into a physical altercation with his father, where he claims he was attacked by his father. The defendant denied any injuries from the incident, and did not know how the victims finger was bit.  Witness:  KAREN SUE RADFORD  The witness, who was present during the incident, refused to cooperate or make any statement regarding what occurred when I asked her. The witness smelled strongly of an alcoholic beverage, displayed watery and bloodshot eyes, slurred her speech, and admitted to consuming  of a bottle of wine.  Scene Processing:  The victims injuries were captured on AXON BWC assigned to me. No injuries were observed on the defendant, and the defendant advised he was not injured from this incident. The defendant admitted to consuming only 2 beers, smelled strongly of an alcoholic beverage, displayed glassy eyes, and was extremely uncooperative and agitated during the investigation.  Inside the residence, a broken window above the kitchen sink was observed, claimed to have either been caused by a thrown cell phone during this incident, or occurred weeks prior. I observed blood drops on the floor of the residence, and blood marks on the interior wall to the left of the door.  Outside the residence, I observed tire marks in the front yard, where the victim stated the defendant drove off, tearing up the front lawn, and a broken clear drinking glass, which smelled strongly of an alcoholic beverage.  Neighborhood Check:  None conducted due to the nature of the incident.  De-Escalation:  The defendant was no longer on scene upon my arrival. I tried to keep the victim and the witness separated, but they were both extremely intoxicated by alcohol. The witness was uncooperative, and the victim was as well.  Narrative:  On 03/01/2023 at approximately 0055 hours, I was on duty, in uniform, operating a marked MSP patrol vehicle: G-39. I responded to the residence of 1035 Washington Rd, Westminster, Carroll County, MD, for a report of an assault in progress.  Upon my arrival, I observed a white female subject outside the residence. This subject was subsequently identified as the witness, KAREN SUE RADFORD. The witness refused to make a statement, advising I need to go inside and talk to her husband, the victim. The witness appeared to be heavily intoxicated: the witness smelled strongly of an alcoholic beverage, displayed watery and bloodshot eyes, slurred her speech, and subsequently admitted to consuming  of a bottle of wine.  A white male came out of the residence and began yelling. This subject was subsequently identified GARY STEVEN RADFORD, the victim. I escorted the victim inside his residence, and obtained his above listed statement. I made my observation of the scene, including capturing the victims injury on my BWC. The victim advised the defendant, GARY STEVEN RADFORD Jr (the victims son), fled the scene and provided a vehicle description as well as the area to which he was heading.  TFC Nield located the vehicle and stopped the defendant in the area of Piney Ridge Parkway and Martz Rd, Eldersburg, Carroll County, MD. I was advised by TFC Nield that the defendant admitted to getting into an argument with his father, admitted to getting into a physical altercation with his father, where he claims he was attacked by his father. The defendant denied any injuries from the incident, and did not know how the victims finger was bit. TFC Nield stated to me the defendant was agitated and uncooperative at all times, and did not complain of any injuries from this incident.  Based on the statement provided by the victim, my observations of the scene, the fact that the victim and defendant are part of a family unit (father and son), the defendants MVA address is the same as the victims, and the victim/s injury, I made the decision to have the defendant arrested for Assault: 2nd degree (domestic). The victim was provided the report number and the victim/ witness rights pamphlet.  TFC Nield transported the defendant (GARY STEVEN RADFORD Jr) to Carroll County Central Booking, where he was charged with the following:  CR 3-203 Assault: 2nd degree (domestic), *1_1415*  All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.  Case closed on arrest.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>.23-MSP-007654  Nature of Incident: Supplemental Report CR 3-203 Assault Second Degree (Domestic Violence Related)  Scene Processing: The traffic stop and subsequent prisoner transport were recorded. Marked MSP patrol car G-23 is equipped with both external and internal MVR. I am equipped with a Body-Worn Camera.  Defendant: Gary Steven Radford Jr. W/MDOB: 01/17/1991  Narrative:   On 3/1/2023 at approximately 0055 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack were dispatched to 1035 Washington Road for an assault. Prior to their arrival, the alleged suspect,Gary Steven Radford Jr., left the scene. The victims advised that Radford Jr. left the scene in a white Ford F-250 and was headed towards Sykesville, Maryland. A BOLO was issued via the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack electronic communications, and I began to actively patrol known routes of travel from Westminster to Sykesville. While on patrol of W/B MD-26 in the area of Piney Ridge Parkway, I observed a white Ford F-250 bearing Maryland registration 2FD2121 traveling in the eastbound lanes. I then conducted a U-turn to investigate the F-250 further, at which time the Ford immediately made an abrupt right turn onto Piney Ridge Parkway. I followed the Ford onto Piney Ridge Parkway and activated my emergency equipment to conduct an investigatory traffic stop on the Ford. The Ford then stopped near the intersection of Martz Road.    I madecontact with the operator of the Ford at the drivers side window. I explained the reason for the traffic stop, explained that the traffic stop was being audibly and visually recorded, and asked the driver for his drivers license. I was able to positively identify the driver as the suspect from the assault by his Maryland drivers licenseGary Steven Radford Jr. (W/MDOB: 01/17/1991). During the traffic stop, I was informed by M/T Fair #5334 that he had established probable cause on scene of the assault to conduct a warrantless arrest of Radford Jr for Second Degree Assault - Domestic Violence. Radford Jr was then placed under arrest without incident and transported to the Carroll County Detention Center where custody was transferred to M/T Fair. During transport, Radford Jr stated that he and his father had gotten into an argument, but did not admit to biting his fathers finger.  All events occurred in Carroll County. Maryland.  This concludes my involvement in this case.</NarrativeText>
