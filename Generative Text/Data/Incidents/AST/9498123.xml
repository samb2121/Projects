         <NarrativeText>AUDIO VISUAL RECORDING:  Captured on body worn camera.   ATTACHMENTS:  -MSP Form 246 (Lethality Screening) - MSP Form 076 (Written statement) - Photographs of victims face. -Photographs of suspects legs.  VICTIM: Wilson Jordan Quiroga (Hispanic/Male DOB 11/19/1988  SUSPECT: Jennifer Gabriela Chavarria-Flores (Hispanic/Female DOB 12/17/2003)  WITNESS: None  LOCATION OF CRIME: Northbound I-270 main lanes prior to Falls Road, Montgomery County, Maryland  CASE NUMBER: 23-MSP-003648  CRIME(S):  CR 3-203 *1_1415* ** Assault  Second Degree**  CRIME SCENE PROCESSING: Chavarria-Flores and Quiroga were interviewed. Chavarria-Flores completed a written statement on scene. A lethality screening was attempted to be completed with Quiroga. Photographs of Quiroga and and Chavarria-Flores were taken.   NARRATIVE:  On January 29, 2023 at approximately 0550 hours, I, Trooper First Class Emerick #6888, was dispatched to northbound I-270 prior to Falls Road in Rockville, Montgomery County, Maryland for a possible domestic assault in progress. I arrived on scene and observed a gray Honda Civic bearing Maryland registration T1158073 that was stopped on the right shoulder of the main lanes with its four way flashers activated and passenger side front door was open. I first made contact with a female who was walking northbound from south of the vehicle. The female was crying and stated that she and her boyfriend got into an argument and he took her phone and keys. The female was identified by her name and date of birth as Jennifer Gabriela Chavarria-Flores (Hispanic/Female DOB 12/17/2003). While I was speaking with Chavarria-Flores, TFC Capezuto #6694 made contact with the male party. I observed that Chavarria-Flores did not have any shoes on. I asked Chavarria-Flores if he put his hands on her and she stated yeah, but I mean it was, I put my hands on him too. So not gonna lie ya know. I asked Chavarria-Flores and she stated not that I can think of. I did not observe any signs of physical injury on Chavarria-Flores at this time. TFC Capezuto identified the male by his name and date of birth as Wilson Jordan Quiroga (Hispanic/M DOB 11/19/1988). Quiroga advised TFC Capezuto that Chavarria-Flores had been out partying, and while on their way to work they got into a verbal argument. Quiroga stated that the verbal argument turned physical when Chavarria-Flores began punching him in the face. Quiroga stated that Chavarria-Flores then began kicking him in the head and face.  I then made contact with Quiroga and he advised me that Chavarria-Flores had been out partying, and they were now on their way to work. Quiroga stated they began arguing about who Chavarria-Flores was texting. Quiroga then called Chavarria-Flores a lying ass hoe. Quiroga then stated that Chavarria-Flores began punching him, and he told her to stop punching him. Quiroga stated that she was straight up hammer fisting him in his face, and his head, everywhere.Chavarria-Flores was using the bottom of a closed fist to strike Quiroga. Quiroga stated he then went from the passenger seat of the vehicle to the backseat to get away from Chavarria-Flores punches. When he went to the back seat Chavarria-Flores threw a cup of soda on him. Quiroga said that Chavarria-Flores called her mom and he told her that he would get a ride home, or call him an Uber and he would leave the car but he wasnt going to be left on the side of the highway. Quiroga stated that he got back in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. At this time he stated that Chavarria-Flores got in the back seat and started kicking him in his face. Quiroga advised that he was able to dodge most of the kicks but seven or eight kicks made contact with his face and head area. In an act of self defense Quiroga bit Chavarria-Flores foot and told her to stop kicking him. Quiroga advised that after he bit her foot she stopped kicking him, and then went at it again. Quiroga then stated that Chavarria-Flores was threatening him with a knife and started chasing him down the highway with a knife.  I observed Quiroga to have blood under his septum, blood on the inside of his lower lip, numerous scratches on his forehead as well as a bump on the right side of his forehead. Trooper John #7358 took photographs of Quirogas injuries with his agency issued camera. There was no knife recovered at the scene. Quiroga advised me that Chavarria-Flores is his girlfriend and that they have been living together for two years. Quiroga advised me that he did not want to place any charges on Chavarria-Flores.  TFC Capezuto and Trooper John attempted to do a lethality screening and written statement with Quiroga. Quiroga declined to answer lethality screening questions, or provide a written statement. As they were speaking with Quiroga, I obtained a written statement from Chavarria-Flores. I then took photographs of two bite marks on Chavarria-Flores legs. Through my investigation I determined Chavarria-Flores to be the primary aggressor in the assault. The Honda was secured, tagged, and left on the right shoulder for 24 hours until the vehicle could be picked up.  Chavarria-Flores was placed under arrest and transported to Montgomery County Central Processing Unit.  All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
