At this time, while monitoring the radio, I heard Baltimore City Aviation unit F (Foxtrot) state that they were chasing a vehicle/subject related to a shooting that occurred. The Suspect vehicle was a black Chevy Impala that was heading west on O/L 695 towards Harford Road. The Baltimore City Aviation unit was requesting units in the area to assist in this matter. At this time, I contacted the Maryland State Golden Ring Barrack and advised the Emergency Dispatcher that I would be assisting in this matter.  Baltimore City aviation advised some of the following facts: The suspect is armed and dangerous. The suspect vehicle is traveling west on O/L 695 past exit 32B. The suspect took exit 31 and bailed out of his vehicle at the Carroll Fuel gas station on Harford Road. The suspect was attempting to carjack a tan or champagne color Nissan Murano at gun point. The suspect subsequently pistol whipped the operator of the Nissan Murano in the back of the head. The suspect immediately left the scene in the black Chevrolet sedan. **It should be noted that at this time, I was nowhere near the vehicle. I was attempting to catch up to the vehicle to help assist in the matter. The suspect vehicle re-entered 695 O/l heading west towards Loch Raven Boulevard. The suspect again got off O/L 695 at exit 29 and carjacked a red/maroon sedan, later found out to be an Acura Sedan at Loch Raven and Joppa Road. ** At this time, I did get off exit 29, however, I did not see nor get close to the suspect vehicle and returned to I-695 O/L. The maroon suspect vehicle proceeded towards I-695 again. ** At this time, the Duty Officer of the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack advised that Pursuing the Suspect is not authorized; we are to only assist in the matter. Simultaneously, I de-activated my emergency equipment. It should be noted that at no time did I have eyes nor was I near the suspect vehicle at this point. The suspect vehicle re-entered I-695 O/L towards Dulaney Valley Road. The suspect vehicle was traveling south towards Fairmount Ave then east on Goucher Boulevard. The suspect vehicle stopped on Goucher Boulevard prior to Lachlan Circle. According to Aviation F Unit the suspect bailed out of his vehicle and advanced to the wood line at the above stated location wearing a purple hoodie and jeans and was armed. ** It should be noted that I was not the first law enforcement officer on scene. There were numerous Baltimore County Units on scene.  During this time, I parked my vehicle closer to the intersection of Goucher Boulevard and Coulbury Road. I then exited my patrol vehicle and approached the wood line area. While approaching the Wood line the Duty Officer of Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack advised the suspect shot himself. Baltimore County units advised the suspect shot himself in his head with the pistol he had in his possession. It should be noted that I did not see or hear any gun shots nor the suspect at this time. While approaching the area of the suspects location, I observed him to be in a supine position on rocks closest to the stream. There were multiple Baltimore County Units on scene around the suspect who started life-saving measures. The suspect was wearing jeans and a purple hoodie. The suspect was later identified as Jonathan Arnel Williams DOB: 08/03/1993 B/M. The Baltimore County units on scene transported Williams from the rocks to a flat grassy area behind Towson Town Apartments behind apartment building 6909. At this time the scene was secure and Emergency personnel arrived and took over the life-saving measures at approximately 1442 hours. Williams was subsequently transported to Shock Trauma at 1451 hours. At this time, I remained on scene until I was advised my assistance was no longer needed. There was no direct action or contact made by me in this matter.  It was later discovered that Williams succumbed due to his self-inflicted gun shot wound.  At approximately 1615 hours, I cleared the scene and responded to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring R Barrack to complete an initial report for this assist other police matter.  I request this case CLOSED due to no further police action taken by me.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Unmarked unit R21 and I, TFC Wilson #6512, am equipped with Axon cameras. My involvement with this incident was not recorded.    On 1/24/2023 I, TFC Wilson #6512, responded to southbound Goucher Blvd prior to Colbury Rd in reference to an incident in which Troopers from the Maryland State Police assisted Baltimore County and Baltimore City Police with a carjacking involving a gun. I arrived at scene at approximately 1446hrs. I located patrol vehicle R-42 and R-9 and ensured they were locked and secured. Additionally, I assisted with securing the perimeter of the crime scene. I later attended a briefing with Baltimore County Police and Baltimore City Police which clarified the series of events, locations, jurisdictions, and agencies involved. It was advised the Maryland Attorney General Independent Investigations Division would not be responding. The MSP case number was provided to one of the primary officers investigating the incident by Tpr Thoren.   All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.   </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>I, Sgt. Taylor #5867, was the day-shift Duty Office at the Golden Ring Barrack on January 24, 2022. At approximately 1419 hours, Baltimore County Dispatch contacted the Golden Ring Barrack regarding a stolen vehicle that was traveling on westbound 695 near Exit 32(Belair Road). The vehicle was described as a black Chevrolet, bearing Pennsylvania registration LZR2660. Baltimore County dispatch was unable to provide any information regarding the occupants, but did state that the occupant was armed. Nearly simultaneously, Troopers began relaying information over the Golden Ring Barrack Channel regarding this vehicle. The Golden Ring Barrack additionally began monitoring the Baltimore County Police Parkville radio channel, where Aviation was providing information on the vehicle. I informed all units over the radio that we would not be pursuing this vehicle due to the presence of Aviation. The operator, who was eventually on foot traveled into a wood line with a stream near 6909 Lachlan Circle, and Aviation advised there was an MSP unit in the area. I advised this over our radio channel, and Tpr. Thoren #7131 acknowledged. I advised that he had a firearm and to use caution. The subject shot himself with the firearm in the wood line, not in her presence. Police personnel on scene eventually approached the individual, who was transported to the Hospital where he succumbed to his injury. I later learned that this vehicle was actually involved in a shooting in Baltimore City.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Video Recording Information:  Maryland State Police patrol vehicle R-33 is equipped with an in-car camera system as well as I am equipped with a body worn camera. The following incident was audibly and visually recorded.  Narrative:  On January 24, 2023, at approximately 1421 hours, I, Trooper Ericksen, assigned to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring barrack operating marked patrol vehicle R-33, was monitoring Baltimore County Police Departments White Marsh radio channel when Baltimore City Aviation Unit Foxtrot advised that they were following a vehicle, a black Chevy sedan, wanted in connection to a shooting in Baltimore City.   Foxtrot advised that the vehicle was in the area of the Outer-Loop I-695 passing Bel Air Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I entered the Outer-Loop I-695 from White Marsh Boulevard and continued to monitor the vehicles location from Foxtrot. Foxtrot advised that the vehicle had exited I-695 to Northbound Harford Road and entered a Carroll Gas Station, 9200 Harford Road. Foxtrot then advised that the suspect exited the Chevy and was actively attempting to carjack a female with a firearm at the Carroll gas station. The suspect then returned to the Chevy and fled the scene. While taking the Outer-Loop I-695 exit to Northbound Harford Road, I observed a black male in a purple hooded sweatshirt operating a black Chevy sedan, leave the Carroll gas station and take the Harford Road ramp to Outer-Loop I-695. The vehicle entered the Outer-Loop I-695, entered the right shoulder at a high rate of speed then crossed all lanes of travel to the left shoulder at a high rate of speed then began weaving in and out of traffic across all lanes. I did not pursue the vehicle and none of my emergency equipment was activated.  Foxtrot then advised that the vehicle was continuing on the Outer-Loop I-695 towards Loch Raven Boulevard. Foxtrot advised the vehicle then exited on Loch Raven Boulevard heading towards Joppa Road. Foxtrot advised that the suspect was again actively attempting to carjack another individual in a maroon Acura sedan. The suspect successfully carjacked the individual and took control of the Acura in the area of Loch Raven Boulevard and Joppa Road. The suspect then fled the scene in the Acura towards I-695. The vehicle then entered the Outer-Loop of I-695 towards Towson.  Foxtrot advised that the Acura had taken the exit for Dulaney Valley Road and continued on Hampton Lane. The Acura traveled on Hampton Lane to Southbound Providence Road. Foxtrot advised the Acura took the Southbound Providence Road ramp to the Outer Loop of I-695.  The Acura continued on the Outer-Loop of I-695 to Dulaney Valley Road. The Acura exited I-695 to Southbound Dulaney Valley Road towards Towson Town Center. The Acura took Eastbound Fairmount Avenue from Southbound Dulaney Valley Road. The Acura continued on Goucher Boulevard eventually becoming disabled in lane 2 prior to Colbury Road. It should be noted that I was never actively involved with the pursuit of the suspect vehicle at any point.  Foxtrot advised suspect exited the Acura and fled into the wooded area between Goucher Boulevard and Lachlan Circle. Foxtrot then advised that the suspect had shot himself.  I arrived on scene with multiple other units. Once it was determined that the scene was safe, I relocated to behind the apartment building located at 6911 Lachlan Circle. I met with TFC Howard #7278 and assisted with enforcing a perimeter around the scene. After observing sufficient Baltimore County Police units, I cleared from the scene.   All above events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On Tuesday, January 24, 2023, I Trooper First Class Howard #7278 of the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack was on routine patrol in full uniform, operating my marked Ford Police vehicle R-42. While scanning Baltimore County Police radio frequency, I learned the Baltimore City Police Department had an Aviation unit following a suspect wanted for a shooting on I-695 Baltimore Beltway approaching Philadelphia Road MD-7, which initially occurred in Baltimore City. Moments later, our Police communications operator began relaying information to Troopers from Baltimore Countys police dispatch. The vehicle the suspect was operating was a black Chevrolet passenger car, bearing a Pennsylvania registration of LZR2660. I began traveling to the last known location of the suspect to assist. We were informed the suspect was armed with a firearm.Another update was broadcasted stating the suspect attempted to carjack a motorist but was unsuccessful. The suspect was then successful in carjacking another motorist. He was now in possession of a maroon Honda passenger car and fled to Goucher Boulevard off Taylor Avenue in the Towson area, where the vehicle became disabled. The suspect exited his vehicle and fled down an embankment into a creek. I arrived on scene moments after. Officers eventually closed in after being notified the suspect was suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officers carried the suspect to a level ground and began administering aid. Emergency medical personnel of Baltimore County Fire Rescue arrived on scene and transported the victim to a nearby Trauma center where he ultimately succumbed from his injuries.</NarrativeText>
