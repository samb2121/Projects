         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Crime:       Assault 2nd Degree ( Domestic Related )  Location:        12413 Shadoe Hollow Rd Cumberland MD / Private Residence  Scene Processing:                All domestic related forms completed on scene.  Narrative:         On 05/16/2023 at approximately 1836 hrs, Cpl. Brinkman and I were dispatched by the Cumberland Barrack to respond to 12413 Shadoe Hollow Rd, Cumberland, for a report of a domestic assault. The barrack advised they obtained a 3rd party call stating that a male was beating up a female at that location.   Upon our arrival we made contact with both a male and female at that address. The female was identified as Gwyneth Elaine Nixon, W/F, DOB 02/14/2002 and the male was identified as Tyler Eric Bennett, W/M, DOB 03/07/2003. Upon entering the home we did not observe any obvious signs of a struggle or an assault. At that time I asked the Gwyneth to speak with me in private, so we went to a rear bedroom of the home. Gwyneth was holding a baby that she identified as her daughter in common with Tyler. The babys name was Hallie Mae Bennett, 10/15/2022. I asked Gwyneth what was going on and she advised she and Tyler were having issues and were trying to work their issues out. She advised approximately 2 weeks ago, the police were also at their home for the same reason, them arguing. She stated Tylers grandfather had just passed away, and she was feeling bad for him so was attempting to mend their relationship. She stated approximately 1 week ago, Tyler left the home and was staying somewhere else, however today they got together trying to fix things. Gwyneth advised at some point while they were eating dinner they began to argue about the status of their relationship. She stated during the argument Tyler took a bottle of Ranch dressing and squirt it all over her, including her face. She said he then ended up hitting her with a pillow. Gwyneth advised that he cleaned up most the mess before we got there, however I could still observe what she identified as Ranch dressing in her right ear.   I then asked if she had any visible injuries or if she was hurt in any particular area on her body and she advised no. I then began to ask about their relationship, and she advised they were just dating, and are currently leasing the home we were at together, that both their names are on the lease. She stated they do have a daughter in common, Hallie.   I then began to explain options to Gwyneth, one being filing for a protective order. She stated she understood all her options, that it was also explained to her a couple of weeks ago when the police were at their home for the same reason. I then went to the kitchen to speak with Tyler. While doing that Cpl. Brinkman began to go over the MSP 246 form with Gwyneth.   Once in the kitchen I asked Tyler what had happened. Tyler stated the same as Gwyneth that they are dating and were having some problems in their relationship. He stated he did squirt Ranch dressing all over Gwyneth, however it was by accident. He stated he was just joking around and was pretending like he was going to spray it, however when he opened it and squeezed the bottle he didnt realize there was pressure built up in the bottle, and it sprayed. Tyler advised they have been arguing the last few weeks, and he did stay with a friend for a week or so, however he could no longer stay at that location, so as of now he has nowhere else to stay. Tyler advised he was not struck or hit during this particular altercation that it was just an argument.   After the above I again contacted Gwyneth who was completing the MSP 246 with Cpl. Brinkman. I advised Gwyneth if she wished to pursue charges against Tyler for squirting her with Ranch dressing and hitting her with a pillow, she could do so through the District Court Commissioner, and she advised she understood, however was not sure if she was going to pursue charges. She did state she thinks she is going to apply for a protective order.   I then advised Gwyneth that Tyler stated he had no place else to stay at the time being, and I could not make him leave. I asked her if she waned to leave for the night, and she advised she would. Gwyneth advised she was going to stay with her grandparents for the evening, who lived in the same neighborhood. Gwyneth then gathered items she and her daughter would need for the night and went to her grandmothers home. She was provided with my information and asked to call or email me when and if she decided to apply for any charges.   Cpl Brinkman completed the MSP 246 and Gwyneth did not screen in according to protocol and did not wish to speak with a hotline advocate at that time.   Due to the above facts I am requesting this case remain open pending Gwyneth decision on applying for charges.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Domestic Follow-up</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>NARRATIVE: In order to complete the required domestic violence follow-up, on March 18 and 24th, I (Sgt. Divelbiss) attempted to call Gweyneth Nixon (301-268-6050) to speak with her about this incident. Nixon did not answer my call on the 18th and her the phone was not in service on the 24th. I am familiar with Ms. Nixon as I spoke with her two weeks prior for a similar incident involving her and Tyler Bennett. During that incident she elected not to purse charges or a protective order. I prepared a letter to include pamphlets for FCRC and District Court providing instructions on how to obtain criminal charges, a protective order, as well as my contact information.  A search of the Maryland judiciary website was completed, which revealed Nixon applied and was issued a protective order (D-121-FM-23-000062) on 5/16, however, the order was dismissed on 5/18 Petitioner Requested Dismissal. I did not locate and criminal charges on the website. Due to this, the investigation into this incident will be closed due to the lack of prosecution by both parties. The lethality screening completed for this incident was sent to the FCRC. All events occurred in Allegany Co, MD.</NarrativeText>
