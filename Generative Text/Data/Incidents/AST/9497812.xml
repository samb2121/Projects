         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-208 R BODENSCHATZ ID: 23-MSP-013475 Defendant: Harley Lynn Bodenschatz TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On April 16, 2023 at approximately 0220 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Kingston Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a silver Chevrolet Trax failing to drive within a single lane. The Chevrolet was bearing Maryland registration 1EC9598.    The Chevrolet made a wide left turn from Kingston Road onto Eastern Boulevard. The Chevrolet crossed the dashed white lane line to the right with the Chevrolets passenger side tires then reentered lane two.  Right over dotted white lane line with half the Chevrolets width.  Drove on solid white fog line with passenger side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with driver side tires, swerved right back into lane two.  Drove on solid white fog line with passenger side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  The Chevrolet continued on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Maryland 702. The Baltimore County Police Department was conducting a traffic stop in the same location and was stopped in lane one. As the Chevrolet approached the Baltimore County Police Departments traffic stop, the Chevrolet crossed left over the dotted white lane line with half of the Chevrolets width.  Right over solid white fog line with passenger side tires.  Drove on solid white fog line with passenger side tires.  Left over dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Glenwood Road. The Chevrolet was in lane two when my emergency lights were activated. The Chevrolet changed lanes twice to the left and entered the left turn lane with a solid red turn signal. The Chevrolet then continued through the red traffic signal without stopping and turned left into a T-Mobile parking lot while the Chevrolets right turn signal was activated.   The traffic signal to continue straight on Eastern Boulevard was green and there was an open parking lot entrance to the right that would not have required running a solid red traffic signal.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Chevrolet on the driver side and made contact with the female operator of the vehicle, who was the sole occupant. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested her drivers license and vehicle registration. The driver failed to locate her vehicles registration. She was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Harley Lynn Bodenschatz. While speaking with Bodenschatz, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Chevrolet and requested Bodenschatz to exit her vehicle. She complied and exited her vehicle. Bodenschatz removed her shoes upon stepping out of her vehicle. While speaking to Bodenschatz outside of her vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. When asked about her consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Bodenschatz stated she had two Sutter Home wines. When asked where she was coming from, Bodenschatz stated she was at a party at her cousins house and was driving home. I informed Bodenschatz that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which she agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed in the T-Mobile parking lot on the sidewalk. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. She appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. She was wearing a black shirt, black shorts, and sandals but Bodenschatz did not wear any footwear during the tests.  I asked Bodenschatz the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None. Physical Injuries  None. Medication  None. Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.    Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.     Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Bodenschatz stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Broke the instructional position to the left and right once each.  Began the test before being instructed.  Walking Stage (1stNine):    Used arms to maintain balance on steps 3-9.  Stepped completely offline on steps 6 and 8.

PBT #70005012 with a result of .16 BrAC.   ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Bodenschatz was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0247 hours, I placed Bodenschatz under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. She was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for further processing.  Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Bodenschatz with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Bodenschatz was advised of her DR-15 Advice of Rights. At 0314 hours, Bodenschatz agreed to take a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Bodenschatz beginning at 0247 hours. A search revealed that she had nothing in her mouth. Bodenschatz was observed from that time until the time she submitted to the test and she did not put anything in her mouth. The test was conducted by Cpl. Wilson of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Bodenschatz had a result of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0330 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****.14 grams of alcohol*****  Bodenschatz was loud, vulgar, and belligerent throughout the interaction. She was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
