         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>DIGITAL EVIDENCE:  This interaction was recorded on my Axon III Body Worn Camera. Pictures were not taken due to the absence of injuries.  SCENE PROCESSING:  A MSP form 246 (Domestic Violence Supplemental Report) was completed by Elmo Joseph Leger. Leger did not screen at high risk.       NARRATIVE: On November 19, 2023, at approximately 0109 hours, I, Trooper Barrientos #7396 with the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Prince Frederick Barrack, responded to 204 West Avenue, Prince Frederick, MD 20678 for the report of a domestic dispute.  I made contact with the complainant who was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Sherrie Amine Blankenship (W/F DOB: 10/30/1970), and who advised that her fianc, Joseph Elmo Leger (W/M DOB: 08/06/1970), returned home from drinking with his friends. Blankenship stated hes had too much to drink, and when he drinks, he gets nasty, and Im not doing it. Blankenship stated that Leger becomes irrational when he consumes alcohol, and stated that Leger was irrational and argumentative when he returned home. I asked Blankenship if there was any physical confrontation between her and Leger, to which she nodded her head no. I asked Blankenship if there was an argument between her and Leger, and she replied its not rational. When interviewing Leger, he advised that he had returned from a friends thanksgiving party and was unloading some kitchen pots from his vehicle into the kitchen when Blankenship became upset and aggressive towards him. Leger stated that he did not know why Blankenship was upset. Leger advised that he was located in the kitchen of the residence when Blankenship became confrontational and slapped him on the right side of his face. Leger stated that he was startled, and pushed Blankenship back while saying No!    Leger stated that Blankenship tripped on a wooden board that was located on the floor of the kitchen and fell backwards. Leger advised that Blankenship then stood back up and slapped him again on the right side of his face. Leger stated that this is when Blankenship exited the kitchen and called the police. I did not observe any physical signs of injury on Leger. When I asked Blankenship to explain the sequence of events, she replied What I want you all to do, is to give him a breathalyzer test, please. Blankenship then advised that she entered the kitchen when Leger got home and began asking him about his day. Blankenship stated that Leger was irrational and told her to go away. Blankenship then advised that there was an exchange of words between the two. I asked Blankenship if she had slapped Leger, she stated I may have slapped him. When someone is yelling and cussing at you I am a smacker.  I asked Blankenship to describe the interaction when the slap occurred, and she replied I dont want to. When asked about any physical injuries, Blankenship displayed red skin irritation on her right tricep, and stated it was the shelves, I cant blame him at all for that, but he did push me. I asked Blankenship how many times she smacked Leger, and she stated If I slapped him, and Im going to say if because I dont recall, it was once at best. I asked Blankenship if she smacked Leger before or after Leger pushed her, to which she stated I have no idea it all happened so quick. Blankenship stated that she did not want to pursue charges against Leger for assault, and stated I wanted you all to be here to stop this nonsense, so I appreciate you guys coming out.  Based on the statements above, Blankenship was determined to be the primary aggressor. It appeared that Legers acts were in self-defense. Blankenship advised that they have been together for 10 years, and that confrontations similar to this situation dont happen often. Leger and Blankenship agreed to stay separated within the residence to avoid further altercation, and peace and protective orders were advised. Leger completed the MSP Form 246 (Domestic Violence Supplemental Report) and declined to consult with a counselor.  On November 20, 2023, an application for statement of charges was completed against Blankenship for Second degree Assault, and is pending review by the Calvert County District Court Commissioner.  Case open pending charges.  All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Narrative:    On 11-22-2023 at approximately 1340 hours, I called Mr. Leger as a follow-up to this investigation. Leger advised that he did not get a peace/protective order for Blankenship and that he does not have any more injuries from that night. I went over a safety plan with him, and he advised that everything is okay and that they are still living together. He advised that he doesnt need any resources when asked and didnt seem to be concerned with any similar incidents occurring between him and Blankenship.  This concludes my part of the investigation.</NarrativeText>
