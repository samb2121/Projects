         <NarrativeText>The following incident was captured on a body-worn camera. Q-17 is not equipped with an MVR.  CASE NUMBER: 23-MSP-004514  NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK: Due to the location of the incident, a neighborhood check was not conducted.  SCENE PROCESSING: Photographs of the vehicle and cell phone were taken at the scene. Witness statement forms were filled out by all involved parties.  SUSPECT: Gurpreet Singh DOB: 11/19/1990 (347)-837-4304 16503C Governor Bridge Road Apartment 107 Bowie, Maryland 20716  VICTIM: Taijuan Xavier Augburn DOB: 11/02/2002 (202)-841-2627 6312 Savannah Drive Brandywine, Maryland 20613  OTHER INVOLVED PARTIES: Rikayla Michelle Miles DOB: 11/11/2002 (240)-887-7390 8405 Laura Lane District Heights, Maryland 20747  Izaiah Dajuan Hair DOB: 12/30/2002 (240)-346-0290 2420 Gerard Court Bryans Road, Maryland 20616  State of Maryland Trooper Harris #7179 (301)-345-3101 10100 Rhode Island Avenue, College Park, Maryland 20740  CHARGES: CR 3-203 - Assault in the Second Degree CR 6-301 - Malicious Destruction of Property Value Less Than $1000  NARRATIVE: On February 5th, 2023 at approximately 0405 hours, I, Trooper Harris #7179, was en route to a dispute involving a tow truck driver and a vehicle he was assisting. The caller alleged lug nuts belonging to his vehicle were removed as a result of no payment to the tow truck driver.  Upon my arrival at 0417 hours, I observed 4 vehicles parked on the right shoulder, a blue Chevrolet Impala displaying Maryland registration 6FD9372, a red Ford Escape displaying Maryland registration 2FA7593, a blue Hyundai Elantra displaying Maryland registration 1FA4516, and a white tow truck. The Impala is owned by Izaiah Dajuan Hair (DOB: 12/30/2002), the Escape is owned by Gupreet Singh (DOB: 11/19/1990), the Elantra is owned by Taijuan Xavier Augburn (DOB: 11/02/2002) and the white tow truck was an uninvolved party, assisting Hair.  I made contact with Hair, Augburn, and Rikayla Michelle Miles (11/11/2002). Initial statements from the 3 individuals revealed that the Impala had a flat passenger side rear tire. Miles and Augburn responded to assist Hair in changing the flat tire with a spare that was in the trunk of the Impala. While doing so, they requested assistance from a tow truck company. The assistance call to the tow truck companies requested a tow and a flat tire change. Singh responded to the scene with his Escape. While Singh was attempting to change the flat tire, it was discovered that the spare tire in the Impala was rusted to the trunk and was unable to be removed. With this discovery, Singh attempted to charge Hair $100.00 for the service. Hair declined to pay and decided to call for a tow truck to pick up his vehicle. After refusing to pay, Singh removed the lug nuts off of both of the driver side tires as well as the passenger side rear tire that was flat. While Singh was removing the lug nuts, Miles and Augburn began to record Signhs actions with their cell phones. From that point, it was alleged that Singh called Miles and Augburn names to include bitch as well as threatening to smack Miles. It was also alleged that Singh smacked Augburns phone out of his hand, striking Augburns arms. I did not identify any visible injuries to Augburn. However, I did notice Augburns phone camera was cracked.  After interviewing Miles, Augburn and Hair, I interviewed Singh. Singh stated that he responded to the Impala for a tire change. After realizing that he cannot change the tire due to the rust, he charged Hair $100 for the service. Hair refused to pay and Singh took the lug nuts off of the Impala. Singh also denied striking Augburn during the incident.  After my interview with Singh, I spoke with the tow truck that was on scene. The tow truck driver stated that he did not witness the incident and that he arrived a few minutes prior to my arrival.  I returned to my patrol car to conduct routine checks on the involved parties. While doing so, Singh walked up to my patrol vehicle and stated he attempted to charge Hair $50 for the service since he removed the lug nuts off of the Impala. I advised Singh that he cannot charge Hair for a service he did not provide since he did not change the tire and provide a tow truck as requested by Hair.  I exited my patrol vehicle and took pictures of the scene as well as collecting witness statement forms from all of the involved parties. I provided Augburn information on how to get in contact with a Prince Georges County Commissioner as well as a Crime Victims and Witnesses pamphlet. I also provided Hair, Miles and Singh a Crime Victims and Witnesses as well as a case number and my information. I advised Singh to pursue this matter in Civil Court if he wishes to get compensation from Hair. I also retrieved video footage of the incident as well as pictures of the offenders vehicle, provided to me from Miles. Video footage revealed Singh removing the lug nuts off of the Impala but did not reveal an assault or damage to a cell phone.  I request this case to remain open pending Augburns follow up with a Prince Georges County Court Commissioner.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On March 1st, 2023, I utilized the Maryland Judiciary Case Search website to inquire if Augburn filed any charges against Singh with negative results. I had also attempted to contact Augburn with his cell phone number and I was unable to reach out to Augburn.  On the same date, I contacted the Prince Georges County Court Commissioners office located at Hyattsville, Maryland via telephone to inquire about any charges that might have been filed involving either party. I provided Augburn and Singhs information and I was advised that there were no results with either party.  I request this case to be closed due to lack of victim cooperation.  </NarrativeText>
