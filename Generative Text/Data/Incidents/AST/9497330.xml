         <NarrativeText>MVR Statement:  My investigation was not recorded on body-worn mobile video recording equipment due to being inside a hospital room in accordance with Maryland State Police Administration Directive 20.02(C)(9)(b).  Scene Processing:  No visible physical injuries were observed.  Attachments:  N/A  Charges:    CR 3-203 Assault - Second Degree (2 Counts)  CR 3-308(B)(1) Sex Offense 4th Degree - Sex Contact   Suspect:  Kavon Tyree Alston, DOB 03/06/1998, B/M  6655 Sykesville Rd, Sykesville, MD 21784  Suspect Statement:  Alston was interviewed at the scene. Alston stated, Firstly, I, I walked up to her. I walked up to move passed her. And when I rub, rub passed her, on her butt. I repeated what Alston stated to confirm what I heard, and Alston stated, I rub passed her. I asked Alston if he said he walked past her, and Alston said, I rub passed her. I asked Alston if it was intentional, and Alston stated, It was, it was uh, it was intentional. I walked up on her and tried to uh, feel, feel on her jiggly ass. I confirmed with Alston that he touched Rosslynne Porter (DOB 08/09/1993 B/F), on her butt, and he stated, Yeah. I asked Alston to attempt to reenact what he did, and he said, I cant, I cant reenact. I asked Alston what hand he used, and Alston stated, I did the left, then I did the left again. I confirmed Alston stated his left hand, and Alston stated, Yeah. I asked Alston what happened with the other young lady, Takea Fuller (DOB 05/17/1989 B/F), and if what he previously stated to Officer Brunson was accurate. He stated, Takea? I said I rub, rubbed past her. I asked him to clarify what he meant and what happened, and he then stated, Yeah, touched bodies. Nah, we aint touch bodies; I touched her body. I asked Alston what part of his body touched Fuller, and he stated, My left arm. I asked Alston if he was walking down the hallway when this occurred, and he stated, Yeah. And the third woman, ugh, I grabbed on, I grabbed all over. It was confirmed the third woman Alston mentioned was from a different incident that was previously reported on March 20, 2023, in which a report was taken by TFC Bandy #6263 (Case # 23MSP010024). I asked when these incidents occurred, and he said, Eight oclock yesterday. I confirmed it was in the evening. I asked Alston what his intent was when touching these females, and Alston stated, Feel good. I confirmed what Alston stated by repeating it to him, and he stated, Yeah. I asked Alston if he remembered where in the hallway he was, and he stated, I was just by, uh, the nurses station. I asked Alston if there was anything else he wanted to tell me, to help me understand, while I was there. Alston stated, You can tell the judge I wanna go home.  Victim # 1:  Rosslynne Marie Porter, DOB 08/09/1993, B/F  6655 Sykesville Rd, Sykesville, MD 21784  Victim # 1 Statement:  Porter was interviewed at the scene. Porter advised Alston had touched her right buttocks outside of her clothing. He came from behind her and touched her buttock for approximately three (3) seconds. Porter advised she noticed Alston was touching her buttocks when she looked at him after he touched her, and he was swaying. Porter advised the incident occurred on March 23rd, 2023, at approximately 2000 hours, in front of the nurses station. While speaking with Porter, I observed her speech to be slurred and mumbled at times.  Victim # 2:  Takea Lavay Fuller, DOB 05/17/1989, B/F  6655 Sykesville Rd, Sykesville, MD 21784  Victim # 2 Statement:  Fuller was interviewed at the scene. Officer Brunson advised Fuller that I was there to take a report about the incident involving Alston. He advised her to tell me what happened between her and Alston. Alston stated, Oh, I was told to be taking my meds. Uh, because if not. And then he just, well, we both passed each other, and he just went about his way to tough me purposefully. Like we was walking past each other, and he talked about touching me, and Im like He always try talk to me, and I ignored him. But I assume he want some type of attention, so I just ignore him. That was when he just touch me, and I was like, Please dont touch me. I asked Fuller where Alston touched her, and she stated, Right on my body, on my bottom, like I had a coat on and everything. So like he, he literally, step, step closer to me to touch me. I didnt know he was gon do that, so, as hes doing that, Im tryna move away, but I guess I didnt walk off. I just walk past him, so thats why he did, and then he touch me. Well, like, he touch my coat, and but what he was aiming at, thats why I got mad, and I said something. And Im like, I dont wanna be his friend, I dont wanna talk to him, I dont want him. And he just sit there, and hell look at me, and he sitting next to each other, and Im like I dont wanna talk to him, I dont want him look at me, I dont want any none of that. I asked Fuller to confirm where Alston touched her, and Fuller stated, I mean, it wasnt under my coat; it was on top of my coat. I confirmed with Fuller she was wearing her coat and what she felt, and Fuller stated, Yeah, I mean, it wasnt he swipe my coat, he went like this, then like that. Like the pressure on me, so thats why I know it; thats why I got mad and said something. Like I said, its different if we was walking past each other and my coat was open, which it wasnt, cause I had my arms in my coat, and it cant do that. I asked Fuller to clarify what she thought Alstons intent may have been, and she stated, I guess to be funny, I dont know. I mean he had outbursts they talk to him about, like talk to people and stuff like that. He spoke to me, but I didnt speak back, so I dont know if that made him mad. I thanked Fuller for her statement and assured her she was clear and easy to understand. I informed her that if she had any further questions for me or was in need of further assistance, the staff at the hospital could help get in contact with me.   Narrative  On March 24, 2023, at approximately 1313 hours, I, Trooper First Class Mills #6784, currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack, was on duty, in uniform, operating marked MSP patrol vehicle: G-40. I responded to the Solomons Building located at 6655 Sykesville Road, Sykesville, Carroll County, MD 21784 (Springfield Hospital Center), for a report of a sexual assault between patients.  Once I arrived on scene, I met Officer Brunson outside. Officer Brunson escorted me inside the facility to a conference room. Once in the conference room, Officer Brunson brought the first victim, Rosslynne Porter (DOB 08/09/1993 B/F), into the conference room to speak with me so that there would not be a disruption in the facility due to mentally ill patients being treated. While speaking with Porter, she provided the above statement.  Officer Brunson then escorted the male suspect into the conference room, who was identified as Kavon Alston (DOB 03/06/1998 B/M). I obtained the above statement. While speaking with Alston, I noted that his ability to concentrate decreased when I was not asking questions, but when someone talked, he was able to communicate effectively.  Officer Brunson then escorted the second victim, Takea Fuller (DOB 05/17/1989), into the conference room. I was able to obtain the above statement from Fuller.  I did not ask the subjects involved for written statements due to the nature of the location of the incident and the purpose of the subjects being treated at the facility, in which a pen could have been used as a weapon in a confined space.  Fuller and Porter were given a Victim Witness pamphlet and both were referred to the Commissioner. Officer Brunson also advised that social worker Kelsey Higgs would assist the victims in getting to the Commissioners Office.  Due to the victims need to stay in the facility, I submitted an Application for Statement of Charges to the Carroll County District Court Commissioner on March 26, 2023, and subsequently, a summons was issued the same day.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
