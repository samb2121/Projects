         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-434 R RUIZ FLORES ID: 23-MSP-029160 Defendant: Luis Mauricio Ruiz Flores TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On August 18, 2023 at approximately 0330 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on the Outer Loop of I-695 in the area of Stevenson Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a grey Honda Accord failing to drive within a single lane. The Honda was bearing Maryland registration OT0014.    Drove on dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.

Right over dotted white lane line with approximately the full width of the Honda.  Left over solid white fog line with the driver side tires.  Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Outer Loop of I-695 ramp to Maryland 795.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Honda on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the sole occupant. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Luis Mauricio Ruiz Flores. While speaking with Ruiz Flores, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Honda and requested Ruiz Flores to exit his vehicle. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking to Ruiz Flores outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Ruiz Flores stated he had two High Noons (Alcoholic Seltzer). I informed Ruiz Flores that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of I-695. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a shirt, shorts, and shoes. I had Ruiz Flores remove the gum from his mouth.  I asked Ruiz Flores the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None. Physical Injuries  None. Medication  None. Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.

Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual.

I again asked Ruiz Flores about his alcohol consumption and he now stated he consumed three High Noons (Alcoholic Seltzer).  ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Ruiz Flores was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0353 hours, I placed Ruiz Flores under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. As I was placing handcuffs on Ruiz Flores, he asked, You cant help me out? Im Fire Department. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Baltimore County Police Department  Towson Precinct for further processing.  Upon arrival at the Towson Precinct, I provided Ruiz Flores with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Ruiz Flores was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights. At 0435 hours, Ruiz Flores agreed to take a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Ruiz Flores beginning at 0406 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Ruiz Flores was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Officer Pugh of the Baltimore County Police Department on a certified instrument. Ruiz Flores had a result of .12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0444 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****.12 grams of alcohol*****  Ruiz Flores was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.
