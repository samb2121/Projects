         <NarrativeText>Incident was recorded on my assigned BWC, Officer Umanzor, Officer Kim, and Sgt. Peck.  I, Trooper Yarbrough #7291, was investigating a hit and run collision that occurred on the Capital Beltway 495 at River Road. I made contact with the suspected driver of the vehicle that fled the scene. I identified him as Andres Alexander Magana by his Maryland Drivers license M-250-076-044-422. He stated he was at a BP gas station at 1907 Veirs Mill road in Rockville Maryland and someone stole his vehicle while he was inside getting a drink. I advised him to wait there and I would meet him at the gas station.  Upon my arrival at the gas station there was multiple Rockville City Officers out with Mr. Magana. The Rockville City Officers advised me that he called them to report his vehicle had been stolen. I made contact with Mr. Magana and asked him what happened. He stated his vehicle was stolen while he was inside the gas station. I asked him multiple times about the hit and run accident that occurred earlier and he refused to answer if he was driving or not. I could not place Mr. Magana behind the wheel of the vehicle. While talking to Mr. Magana he became very irate with one of the Rockville City Officers (Sgt. Peck #5578). I attempted to deescalate the situation by taking Mr. Maganas attention away from Sgt. Peck. Mr. Magana walked up towards Sgt. Peck in an aggressive manner and got up in his face hitting his forehead off Sgt. Pecks chin. Sgt. Peck than pushed Mr. Magana to the ground and attempted to arrest him for Assault on a police officer. Mr. Magana started to resist arrest by tightening up his arms and not rolling on his stomach. I assisted Sgt. Peck with trying to handcuff Mr. Magana who was locking his arms up and refusing to put his hands behind his back. While trying to handcuff Mr. Magana I gave verbal commands for him to stop resisting and put his hands behind his back. Mr. Magana refused to listen to commands and continued to resist. Officer Umanzor #5658 and Officer Kim #5665 assisted in handcuffing Mr. Magana. While attempting to handcuff Mr. Magana I used soft empty had techniques to grab his right leg and pin it down to the ground to stop him from rolling over. Once I got his leg pinned I assisted the Rockville City Officers in pulling his arms behind his back by grabbing his wrists. Once he was handcuffed all my use of force ceased.  Mr. Magana sustained minor abrasions to his forehead and right elbow. I sustained minor abrasions to my right hand. Pictures were taken of all the injuries sustained. An ambulance was called for Mr. Magana for his injuries.  All events occurred in Montgomery County, MD.</NarrativeText>
