         <NarrativeText>CRIME - 2nd Degree Assault  SUSPECT - Donald Richard Henry          B/M DOB 06/29/1993  VICTIM - Kristina Marie Joiner        W/F DOB 03/20/1993  NARRATIVE - On June 3, 2023 at approximately 1515 hours I, S/T Nickerson #5702 of the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack was dispatched to 6336 Church Hill Road Chestertown Maryland 21620 for a reported dispute between boyfriend and girlfriend. Prior to my arrival deputies from the Queen Annes County Sheriffs Office arrived at scene. Once I arrived one scene, I spoke with the complainant Kristina Marie Joiner, W/F DOB 03/20/1983.  Joiner advised that she and her boyfriend, Donald Richard Henry, B/M DOB 06/29/1993, had been beefing for days and that he was trying to leave to residence. Joiner stated that she did not care that Henry was leaving, she has wanted him gone for a while, but the issue was he was taking things that did not belong to him. I told Joiner that since they were in a relationship the property dispute is a civil matter not criminal. Joiner then stated that Henry had pushed her down earlier in the day when they were fighting over a PlayStation 5 gaming console. Joiner stated that this occurred in the office, and it should be on camera. Joiner also stated that days prior to this incident, Henry had shut a door on her foot and her left big toe was now black. Joiner stated that her and Henry were arguing, and she was running after him, Henry was going in a room and slammed the door on her, which injured her foot. Joiner stated that the police have responded multiple times for arguments, and she did not have any marks on her. Joiner stated I have marks today, I want him (Henry) arrested.  Joiner was unable to operate the camera system in the office. Joiner advised the computer mouse was missing and Henry hid it to hide evidence. Joiner did not have any marks or injuries from allegedly being pushing during the altercation over the PlayStation 5.  I then spoke with Henry. Henry confirmed that he and Joiner had been arguing for a few days, and he was trying to leave. Henry stated that earlier in the day he was packing his things in order to vacate the residence and Joiner became upset that he was leaving. Henry stated that while he was attempting to pack his belongings, Joiner became upset and was blocking him from gathering his belongings. Henry stated that he and Joiner were arguing over the PlayStation 5 and that Joiner my have fallen when Henry snatched the gaming console from her. Henry advised he did not intentionally push her nor did he hit her in any way. I asked Henry about Joiners foot. Henry stated Joiner was sitting in her vehicle and then started chasing Henry into the residence, Henry stated that once he shut the door to the room, Joiner crashed into it. Henry advised that he was going to Room 123 for the night until his ride could come.  I spoke with Joiner again and advised her she could respond to the Queen Annes County Commissioners Office to file for charges and a protective order. Joiner did not agree and stated she wanted Henry arrested right now. I advised Joiner I was not arresting Henry on scene due to lack of evidence. Joiner eventually agreed. Joiner also completed the Domestic Violence Supplemental Report.I advised Joiner that Henry was going to stay in Room 123 for the night and to not bother him. Joiner became upset again and advised he was not allowed to stay per her boss. I advised Joiner that if her boos did not want Henry to stay then he would have to respond to the scene to express this.  Joiner did respond to the Queen Annes County Commissioner. Per the commissioner she started filling out the proper paperwork, and then she left and never came back.  On 6/26/2023 I contacted Joiner and checked Maryland Judiciary Case Search. Joiner stated she did not go to file for charges or obtain a protective order. Joiner stated that she did not follow through with any charges.  I request this case to be closed.  All of the above stated events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.    </NarrativeText>
