         <NarrativeText>This incident was audibly and visually recorded using the Axon digital body camera worn by Trooper Tenney #7465.  Scene Processing: Three (3) Maryland State Police Written Statement Forms (MSP 076) were completed by Gardner, Carlin, and Dobrodey (copies are attached to this report).  I photographed the scene and vehicles.  Narrative: On September 17, 2023, at approximately 1628 hours, I was on uniformed patrol in my marked Maryland State Police patrol vehicle, S-36. I responded to Maryland Route 18, in the area of Didonato Drive, Chester, Queen Annes County, Maryland, 21619, for a reported motor vehicle collision. While I was responding, the complainant advised the drivers of both vehicles had exited their vehicles and began to physically assault each other. The complainant advised the driver of a silver 2023 Ford F150, displaying Maryland registration 4FL5757, re-entered his vehicle and fled the scene of the collision.  I arrived on scene and made contact with the complainant, who was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Anne Marie Gardner, W/F, 01/08/1969. Gardner advised the driver of the Ford, who she identified as the registered owner of the Ford as Gidon Zahar David Carlin, W/M, 09/08/1981, had been involved in a road rage incident with the driver of a green 2011 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, displaying Maryland registration 3AC4611. The driver of the Chevrolet was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Joseph Tychon Dobrodey, W/M, 12/06/1961. Gardner advisedDobrodey and Carlin were traveling westbound on Maryland Route 18, in the area of Didonato Drive. Gardner advised she was traveling behind bothDobrodey and Carlin. Gardner advisedDobrodey attempted to pass Carlin on two (2) separate occasions. Gardner advised she observed Carlin cut Dobrodey off on both occasions. Gardner advised Dobrodey passed Carlin in the westbound lane, while Carlin was still in the eastbound lane. Gardner advised Carlin, using his Ford, struck the drivers side ofDobrodeys vehicle. Gardner advised Carlin, using his Ford, droveDobrodey off the roadway and onto the shoulder. Gardner advised whenDobrodey and Carlin both came to a complete stop, Dobrodey and Carlin exited their vehicles and began to physically assault each other. Gardner advised she began to verbally scream at bothDobrodey and Carlin to stop fighting. Gardner advised Carlin re-entered his Ford and fled the scene of the collision.  I made contact with Dobrodey.Dobrodey advised Carlin was traveling westbound on Maryland Route 18 at a slow rate of speed.Dobrodey advised he attempted to pass Carlin in the dotted yellow passing zone on Maryland Route 18.Dobrodey advised Carlin, using his Ford, moved over to the eastbound lane and blockedDobrodey from passing him.Dobrodey advised he re-entered the westbound lane and passed Carlin.Dobrodey advised Carlin remained in the eastbound lane and, using his Ford, attempted to ramDobrodey off of the roadway.Dobrodey advised Carlin struck the drivers side of his Chevrolet.Dobrodey advised he was able to get in front of Carlin before coming to a stop in lane 1.Dobrodey advised he exited his vehicle to capture pictures of Carlin and his license plate number.Dobrodey advised Carlin exited his vehicle and began to physically assault him. Dobrodey advised Carlin threw him to the ground and continued to assault him. Dobrodey advised he detected the distinct odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Carlins breath. Dobrodey advised Carlin got back into his Ford and left the scene.  It should be noted that I did not get to speak withDobrodey on scene, due to him being transported by EMS to the Emergency Center Queen Annes, located at 115 Shoreway Drive, Queenstown, Queen Annes County, Maryland, 21658.  On September 18, 2023, at approximately 1200 hours, I traveled to Carlins residence, located at 167 Ridgeway Circle, Arnold, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 21012, to serve him with the appropriate citations for fleeing the scene of a motor vehicle collision. Carlin advised Dobrodey was traveling westbound on Maryland Route 18 approximately three (3) to four (4) vehicles behind him. Carlin advised Dobrodey was weaving in and out of traffic, obviously upset at the traffic situation. Carlin advised Dobrodey came up behind him and was following very closely for some time. Carlin advised he was traveling the posted speed limit of 40mph. Carlin advised Dobrodey attempted to pass him on a solid double yellow line. Carlin advised he, using his Ford, blocked Dobrodey from passing him. Carlin advised Dobrodey slammed in the back of his Ford. Carlin advised Dobrodey re-entered the westbound lane and crossed the solid white shoulder line and passed Carlin, clipping his Ford in the process. Carlin advised once in front of him, Dobrodey slammed on his brakes, forcing Carlin to stop. Carlin advised he andDobrodey exited their vehicles. Carlin advised Dobrodey started rushing him and began to swing his fists at Carlin. Carlin advised he defended himself and threw Dobrodey to the ground. Carlin advised due to the volatile nature of Dobrodey, and he had a juvenile in his vehicle, felt threatened byDobrodey and left the scene for his sons protection.  I issued Carlin the citations for incident, and referred him andDobrodey to the Queen Annes County Commissioners Office, if they wished to pursue any charges.  On September 21, 2023, at approximately 1920 hours, I made contact with Dobrodey via his cell phone. Dobrodey advised on September 19, 2023, at approximately 1030 hours, he filed for charges against Carlin through the Queen Annes County Commissioners Office, located at 120 Broadway, Centreville, Queen Annes County, Maryland, 21619, however, the charges were not granted.  Carlin advised he did not wish to pursue any charges.  Case closed.  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, and Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
