         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING: I attempted to call several numbers with Ms. Hunter while on scene and spoke with various representatives of Comcast Xfinity.  My interaction with Hunter was recorded on Axon Body Cam 00017420.  NEIGHBORHOOD CHECKS: None.  NARRATIVE:  On 3/15/2023 at approximately 1405 hours, I, Senior Trooper S. Marshall was dispatched to respond to 11930 Sherree Lane, Princess Anne, Somerset County, Maryland reference a scam that results in a theft of money.    Upon arrival to the scene, I met with the complainant, Kathleen Ruth Hunter. Hunter advised that she received a text message yesterday, 3/14/2023, on her phone to call a number and get half price off her Comcast Xfinity bill. Hunter advised that she was told to get a $450 dollar Target gift card and call the number back with the gift card number, and she would be all set for the discounts for her account. Hunter advised the person she spoke with knew how much money she even owed on her Comcast bill.Hunter advised the person on the phone told her she would pay $99 a month for the next two years. Hunter advised that she got the gift card from Food Lion. Hunter advised the number that text her was 908-837-3756.  Hunter stated that she received a call today and the person on the phone told her to go and purchase another Target gift card because the first one did not work. Hunter advised the phone number she called was 1-800-748-6231 and she advised the manager was a Kevin Thomas with a Manager number of KT917C. Hunter advised the person on the phone stated that she would get $50 on a gift card for the inconvenience of the first Target gift card.  Hunter and I then called the 1-800-748-6231 together.Hunter advised we waited a long time on the phone before someone answered us and also advised that when you call Comcast XFinity it would have you listen to deals rather than music. Hunter and I then spoke with a Ricardo Summit reference this situation. Ricardo advised this was Xfinity, and they were in Philadelphia. Ricardo advised me he did not understand the situation and advised that you can easily pay with a target credit card. Ricardo was rude and advised he would give us a number to the Philippine Department. Ricardo advised that we could speak Kevin Thomas. Ricardo advised that certain classes of people could benefit from these and Hunter could get her money back from Food Lion. We then spoke with Kevin Thomas. Thomas advised that Hunter would not be able to get her money back, and he did not understand her calls. Thomas advised to Hunter why would she get her money back from scammers.  Hunter provided me with other phone numbers. Those phone numbers were 866-275-5691, 855-231-9233, and 855-447-7950. Hunter advised that one of the numbers even said scam when she called. I then put 866-275-5691 into google and sites came up advising this was a scam number. I then did the same for 855-231-9233 and that number come back to a Skynetty company. The last number of 855-447-7950 came back to a scam number website.  At approximately 2015 hours, I called 800-943-6489 and spoke with Brie (#1195). Brie gave me the proper phone number for Comcast Xfinity. The number was 866-316-1619. I attempted to speak with a representative but was on hold for an extended period of time.  I advised Hunter while I was on scene that I would do an incident report for this incident in case other incidents like this started to be called in.  I advised Hunter to not give anymore information or money to any text messages or scam phone numbers.  I request this case be closed. </NarrativeText>
