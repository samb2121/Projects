         <NarrativeTitle>Police Information (Smith)</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 10/22/23 an email was sent to the Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack Duty Officer. The email was from a man identified as Callum Scott from the United Kingdom; Scott advised a man from Calvert County was verbally abusive towards him over Instagram messages. Scott advised the man sent him a link (https://foxbaltimore.com/amp/news/local/24-year-old-shot-at-party-in-calvert-county-on-halloween)of a murder that occurred in Calvert County, Maryland and a message followed from the man that stated, this is what i do to ppl in real life. The email contained attachments of the Instagram exchange between the Scott and the unidentified male along with screenshots of the Instagram user account the messages came from (the attachments will be uploaded to this case file).   The email and its contents were sent to CED Central South Investigators on 10/23/23 for a follow up investigation. Sgt. Newcomer assumed the case and reached out to Scott via email on 10/25/23 to set up a phone interview with Scott. Scott responded to the email from Sgt. Newcomer and advised calls from the United Kingdom to the United States cost 3.50 a minute, and how it will quickly add up to a large amount. Is there any way we would be able to organize a call through a platform like WhatsApp or something similar?. Sgt. Newcomer advised Scott we could do a video call on Google on 10/26/23. Scott responded Actually it appears Google Call still uses my network, so charges still apply. It really needs to be an internet-based service. Sgt. Newcomer advised Scott we could do a Zoom call on 10/27/23 at 1000 hours United States EST time. Scott responded Sadly Im not available at all today, we would have to reschedule for next week. Is there any information I can give you in the meanwhile that will help you?. On 10/27/23, Sgt. Newcomer advised Scott that since he reported this incident to the Maryland State Police a short interview with him would need to be conducted with him as he is alleging threats being made. Scott has not responded to Sgt. Newcomer since 10/27/23.   On 10/27/23 investigators researched the link sent to Scott via Instagram messenger. It was determined that this incident was NOT a murder however it was a shooting that occurred in Calvert County, Maryland that occurred on 10/31/2020. This case was investigated by CED Central South case number 20-MSP-040656. Investigators spoke with the case manager for his case, and it was closed by arrest due to the victim identifying the suspect via a photo lineup. The case manager advised no one else was suspected to have committed the shooting and the suspect was arrested and charged accordingly. Investigators were able to identify the unidentified man who sent the Instagram messages to Scott as Richard Williaum-Smith, B/M, 7/6/2002.   On 11/9/2023 at approximately 1000 hours, investigators made contact with Smith at his residence located at 3742 8th Street, North Beach, Maryland 20714. Investigators showed Smith a printout of the Instagram messages sent from his account and asked him what he meant by sending these messages. Smith advised he got into a silly argument with a guy he didnt even know on Instagram and the guy said things about nothing going on in Calvert County, so he sent the message to show him that crimes do happen in Calvert County. Smith advised he was not present during the shooting in 2020 and only knows about it because it was everywhere on the news. Smith advised he meant no ill will or intended any harm to Scott and was just engaged in an immature conversation that was not his best judgment. Investigators advised Smith to make sure he takes these conversations seriously and not engage or contact Scott in further conversations. Smith advised he understands and doesnt even know Scott and his account has been blocked for some time.      Due to the above factors this case will be closed administratively.  </NarrativeText>
