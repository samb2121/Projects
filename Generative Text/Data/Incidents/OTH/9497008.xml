Narrative:   On 3/18/23, I, M/Tpr. A. Edwards, was dispatched to 1508 Old Ocean City Road, Salisbury, MD for a report of a lost firearm. When I arrived on scene, I made contact with the complainant, Dannie Morris [hereinafter referred to as Morris] who advised he had not seen his handgun in approximately one week. Below is a synopsis of the statements that Morris made to me and is not a transcript, therefore some paraphrasing may be used:   He has a concealed carry permit to carry a handgun and has had it for approximately two years.  He obtained ther permit because he is a business owner and also does work as an Uber driver.  He purchased a gun approximately two years ago, however, he has been unable to locate it since approximately 3/11/23.  He last saw his gun in the large storage compartment in the center console of his Chevrolet Suburban while he was at his business in Cambridge, MD.  He has driven to numerous places since last Saturday and has removed numerous items from his vehicle since then and does not know where the gun could be located.  He checked under the seats in the vehicle as well as his Chevrolet Malibu that he owns and has been unable to locate the handgun.  He did not see any damage to his vehicle to indicate that someone would have entered his vehicle to steal the handgun.  He does know of anyone that knows he has the handgun and would want to steal the handgun.    Morris provided the box for the gun and I was able to locate the serial number on it. The gun was identified as a Taurus, model G2c, semiautomatic 9mm handgun black in color, S/N 1C012994. He provided paperwork from Kendall Firearms an which showed a purchase date of 3/22/2021 for the gun and several accessories. Morris also provided two concealed carry permits:    Maryland permitnumber: 21HGP-021846     No issue date listed   Expiration date: 4/30/24      Arizona Department of Public Safety permit number: 11548241     Issued 5/22/20   No expiration date listed        Morris does not believe the gun was stolen from his vehicle and believed he lost it while exiting his vehicle at some point during the last week.    Morris was provided a case number and advised to call the barrack if he located his firearm at any time in the future.    The gun was entered into METERS/NCIC. NIC number: G555885811.  Case closed.  </NarrativeText>
