         <NarrativeText>Date: Friday, June 30th, 2023   Crime: Motor Vehicle/Unlawful Taking Location: 5403 MT Holly Rd East New Market, MD 21631   Suspect: Stanley Terry Weeks DOB: 01/26/1971 6316 Cabin Creek Rd Hurlock, MD 21643   Victim: U-Haul  Scene Processing:   Audibly and Visually recorded BWC.  Application of Charges   Criminal Summons                                                                                                                             Narrative:   On Friday, June 30th, 2023, I, TFC Angeli #6827 responded to the U-Haul at 5403 Mt Holly Rd East New Market, MD 21631 for a report of theft of a motor vehicle. I made contact with the U-Haul employee at the front desk. A male subject by the name of (Stanley Terry Weeks) rented out a 20 foot U-Haul box truck unit # (TT6277E) on June 16th, 2023. Weeks was authorized to rent the vehicle for a period of only 24 hours.   After the 24-hour period, Weeks failed to return the U-Haul box truck rental back to U-Haul. Employees attempted to get into contact with Weeks via telephone and he refused to return it telling them that it was lost. I was able to locate an updated address for Weeks of 6316 Cabin Creek Rd Hurlock, MD 21643. I responded up to that location in attempt to locate Weeks and the U-Haul truck.   Upon my arrival, I located the U-Haul truck parked in the grass off to the right side of the residence. I was able to confirm that it was the U-Haul truck that was missing unit # (TT6277E). The doors to the U-Haul truck were locked and keys were not with the truck. As we waited for U-Haul to send an employee to pick the truck up, Weeks walked out to us from behind the residence with shaving cream on his face. Weeks stated that he just found the truck last night in Cambridge. He stated that it was rented under his name and that he couldnt find it and found it last night and had to return it this morning. Weeks advised that he rented the truck for some people that he knew, and advised that they took it and he didnt know where it was.   Weeks advised that he wasnt able to answer U-Hauls phone calls because half the time his phone doesnt work showing me that he has a small crack on top corner of his phone. He stated that he was getting ready to take the truck back now with whatever was in it. Weeks advised he gave the U-Haul truck to some friends he knew but doesnt know their full names. I asked Week what he rented the truck for, and he stated to help move their stuff. Weeks stated that they had a house that they wanted to move out of but couldnt tell me where the house was. I asked him how long he was looking for the U-Haul truck, and he advised the whole day yesterday. He stated that he found the truck at the Cambridge Inn.   Weeks stated okay Im going to level with you guys stating that he got caught in a shitty situation. Weeks stated that he rented the truck for some friends of his to move some stuff out the house. He stated that he gave them the truck, and they didnt have it back on time. Weeks stated that he dropped it off and after the weekend he came back. Weeks advised that he was only supposed to have the truck for two days. He stated that the first name of the person he gave it too is Dwayne. He couldnt give me a last name. Weeks stated that he dropped the truck off at the corner of Academy St and Bunker St.   Weeks stated again that he rented the truck for them. Weeks thought they were renting it because they (his friends) paid for it, and he was just going to be the driver. Weeks stated that it was supposed to be there for two days and it just kept dragging on and on. Weeks thought a couple more days wouldnt hurt and that hell just pay the extra money. Weeks stated that he had to go back to work, and he thought that truck would be dropped back off, but they didnt drop it off to U-Haul. A U-Haul employee responded to 6316 Cabin Creek Rd to pick up the U-Haul truck and return it back to U-Haul.  I request this case to remain opening pending application of charges.  All events did occur in Dorchester County, MD.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>    On Wednesday, July 26th, 2023, I submitted an application of charges to the Dorchester County Commissioners Office. The Commissioner issued a Criminal Summons for Weeks. I responded to Weeks residence of 6316 Cabin Creek Rd Hurlock, MD 21643 in attempt to serve the summons but there was no answer. I then responded to his place of employment Amick Farms and was able to make contact with him. Weeks was served with the Criminal Summons and provided copy at 1330 hours.  I request this case to be closed.</NarrativeText>
