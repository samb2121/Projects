         <NarrativeText>Unmarked A-5 is equipped with an in-car camera, and I am equipped with a Body Worn Camera (BWC). The assault is considered to be domestic in nature, but was not captured on cameras. Interview with the victim was captured on camera.  SCENE PROCESSING: Photographs were taken of Medleys reported injured areas and hands.  NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK: A neighborhood check could not be conducted due to the incident occurring on the highway.  VICTIM:  Aaron Jovan Rayshawn Medley DOB: 5/4/1988 #1/M (boyfriend) 37 Robins Egg Court Columbia, SC 29229 (803) 979 0741  SUSPECT: Nikira Nashonda Henry DOB:11/18/1984 #1/F (girlfriend) 117 Churchland Drive Columbia, SC 29229  OTHER NAMES:   Myra Medley DOB: 5/16/2014 #1/F   Zania Medley DOB: 7/01/2017 #1/F   margin-left:8px"&gt;Josh Medley DOB: 1/14/2018 #1/M  All children listed above are not children of Henry. They are Medleys children from a previous relationship. The children were not injured in the assault that was reported.  NARRATIVE: On 11/23/2023 at approximately 2127 hours, I was dispatched by the Maryland State Police, Waterloo Barrack, to respond to the north-bound Interstate 95 (I-95) Welcome Center for a report of an assault that occurred. Prior to my arrival, I was advised there were children on scene, and one of the parties involved was reported to be intoxicated.  I arrived on scene and spoke to one of the parties involved, Aaron Jovan Rayshawn Medley, DOB: 5/4/1988, as confirmed by his South Carolina drivers license. Medley had his three children with him, Myra, Zania, and Josh. Their information is listed above. Medley was initially abrupt about providing any personal information regarding identities. I informed Medley that if an assault occurred, that at the very least, the parties could be documented. This information was relayed later, informing Medley that if there was an assault that occurred in South Carolina, he would have this incident as a reference point for any previous history. Medley then provided his drivers license and information regarding his girlfriend. Medley stated his girlfriend, Nakira Henry, DOB: 11/18/1984, was driving the twelve of them (Henry, Medley, Medleys three children, and 8 additional children belonging to Henry) to New York for a trip. Medley stated during the travel, he believed Henry to be impaired by alcohol, due to her erratic driving. Medley continued, stating an argument ensued, and Henry began striking Medley in the face and neck area. This was confirmed by speaking with Medleys children. Medley pointed out where he was struck, on the neck, left cheek, and bottom lip. Medleys bottom lip showed some discoloration. Photographs were taken of the parts of the body Medley stated he was struck, as well as his hands. I asked Medley if his kids, or he would like to be medically evaluated or needed a hospital, and he refused medical attention, stating he was fine. Medleys demeanor was apologetic, scared, and did not want to get Henry in trouble. He stated a few times he was scared she was Going to get him and had people in the area she could drop pings to, but also stated they were not from the area and did not know anyone in the area. Medley stated he did not want charges pressed, and reiterated it on multiple occasions during the interview. I informed him he did not have too, but a report would be conducted in case he would like to file any charges at a later time. I informed Medley if he did not like to press charges, Peace/Protective orders could be a viable option. I asked Medley if he was romantically involved with Henry, to which he stated, Yes. Medley stated they have been dating for a little over a year, do not have any children together, and live separately most nights. Medley stated Henry left the scene, after forcing him and his children out of the vehicle, to which he complied for safety reasons. Medley stated Henry was in a black BMW X7, and had her 8 other children still in the vehicle. Due to safety concerns for the children, we attempted to locate Henry, using pings and phone calls, but were unsuccessful. I requested the assistance of Howard County Police to search the area around I-95 for Henry, but they were unsuccessful. Henry was unable to be located at any time.  I requested Medley if we could continue the interview at the Waterloo Barrack, so we could get them out of the cold temperatures, to which Medley complied. Sr/Tpr. Dugue #5832, of the Waterloo Barrack, transported Medley, while I transported his three children. Sr/Tpr. Dugue provided Medley with a MSP 246 form, Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report. In the screening conducted by Sr/Tpr. Dugue, Medleys questionnaire did not result in a High Danger Assessment.  At the barrack, Medley provided a written statement while waiting for an Uber to take him and his children to his fathers house in Trenton, NJ. I provided Medley with all appropriate information, including my email and case number. Due to Medleys inability to meet again, I requested he provide additional pictures to my email in the next few days if injuries develop, to which he agreed. I provided Medley with information regarding Peace and Protective orders, as well as advising him of filing his own charges at the Commissioners Office, if he chose to do that option.  I completed for an Application for Statement of Charges against Henry for CR 3-203, Assault in the Second Degree.  I request this case to remain open, pending receiving additional photos from Medley. All events occurred in Howard County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> On 11/23/2023 at approximately 2127 hours, I was dispatched to assist TFC Shiveler #6683 of the Maryland State Police Waterloo Barrack with a possible assault, which occurred on northbound Interstate 95 in the area of the I-95 Rest Area (Welcome Center).Upon my arrival, I observed an African American male and three young children standing outside the restrooms in the Rest Area (Welcome Center). The African American male was identified as Aaron Jovan Rayshawn Medley, DOB: 5/4/1988. Medley was having a conversation with TFC. Shiveler. Medley advised while he was traveling on the highway, along with his girlfriend, his children and other passengers in the vehicle, he believed his girlfriend, the driver of the vehicle, whom he identified as Nakira Henry, DOB: 11/18/1984, was intoxicated. Medley stated that Henry starting to drive at a high rate of speed. Medley then expressed his concerns about Henrys erratic driving behavior. Medley advised he and Henry got into a verbal argument and Henry became upset and struck him in the face and neck with her hand.I completed the MSP form #246, (Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report) on Medley inside my patrol vehicle. Medleys questionnaire did not result in a High Danger Assessment.Shortly after the assessment, I transported Medley to the Maryland State Police Waterloo Barrack for further processing.  Please see TFC. Shivelers report.  All events occurred in Howard County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On November 27, 2023 at approximately 1255 hours, I, D/Sgt Updegraff #5372 contacted the victim, Aaron Medley, via telephone. I explained to Medley that I was conducting a follow-up investigation related to this case. Meldey advised that he was back home in South Carolina. I asked Medley if there had been any other issues or contact with the suspect, Nikira Henry, since the date of the incident (11/23/23) to which he stated no. Medley stated that he has cut all contact with Henry since that date, and they are no longer friends. I asked Medley if he had filed for charges or a peace / protection order on Henry, to which he stated no. I asked Medley if there was any other information hed like to advise me related to this case which he stated no, only that he was extremely grateful and appreciative of the troopers on scene that night and that they went above and beyond to take care of him and his children. I advised Medley if there are any further issues that arise, he has any other information, or has any questions in the future, to contact the investigating trooper / the Waterloo Barrack.
