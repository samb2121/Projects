         <NarrativeText>  This incident was captured by the Axon body worn camera (X60A64694) of Cpl. Diehl #5745. Two previous incidents, occurring on July 11, 2023, were also captured on the body worn camera of Cpl. Diehl. Other incidents may have been captured by additional body cameras of other law enforcement.    The Maryland State Police Cumberland Barrack and the Allegany County Sheriffs Office have responded to this location multiple times for similar incidents beginning June 5, 2023. A list of dates and incident numbers is attached to this report. Two addresses have been given for calls for service at the Health Center. The addresses are 17202 and 17204 McMullen Highway, Cumberland (Rawlings), Maryland 21502. The alleged violation for most of these calls is violation of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Maryland does not currently have a charge for this and any violation would have to be charged federally.    A national protest to abortion is currently occurring. This organized event is called 40 Days for Life. There is a website, www.40daysforlife.com, that is active and provides information in reference to this protest.    The Womens Health Center of Maryland is currently open and accepting patients. The hours of operation are 0800 to 1715 hours Monday through Thursday and 0800 to 1300 hours on Friday. ------------    On September 28, 2023 at approximately 1449 hrs, I was dispatched to the Womens Health Center of Maryland at 17202 McMullen Highway in reference to an alleged violation of the Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act). The complainant was Lyz.    Upon my arrival to the address, I made contact with the lone protester in front of the health center. The protestor was identified as Michele OBrien. OBriens vehicle was parked across McMullen Highway in a vacant lot. It was previously verified that the protestors have permission to park in this vacant lot. OBrien was cooperative and stated that she had not been at that location before to protest. I informed her of the areas where she could protest to ensure she was aware. She was informed that she could not block the entrances to the health center and could not go onto the health center property while protesting. OBrien stated that she had not done either. OBrien stated that she could not stand in one place for an extended period of time, so she was slowly walking back and forth in front of the health center on the shoulder of McMullen Highway.    I then made contact with Alyssa Lyz Moore-Frey. Moore-Frey had exited the building and was standing near the entrance to the building. She advised that the protester currently out front was the only protester that had been there that day. Moore-Frey advised that the protestor, OBrien, had blocked the entrance to the health center three times in violation of the FACE Act. A different employee had informed OBrien that she could not block the entrance during the first instance, Moore-Frey advised OBrien on the second instance, and Moore-Frey called the Maryland State Police at the third instance. Moore-Frey advised that the health center had security cameras which captured the alleged violation. Moore-Frey showed me still images on her cell phone that were taken from the security cameras. The still pictures showed OBrien in front of the entrance to the health center. Due to the image being a still picture taken from a video, I was unable to determine if OBrien was standing in the entrance or walking across in front of the entrance. No vehicles tried to enter the parking lot while OBrien was in front of the entrance. OBriens actions did not impact any patients.    It is important to note that this health center has two entrances / exits. Both are wide enough for a car to enter while another car exits the parking lot. It would be impossible for one individual to prevent access to both entrances of the parking lot. It would also be very difficult for one individual to prevent access to a single entrance unless they were actively moving to intentionally stay in front of a vehicle trying to enter.    Moore-Frey was adamant that she wanted OBrien charged with violation of the FACE Act. I informed Moore-Frey that I would complete a report documenting the incident, but there would not be any charges from this incident. Moore-Frey stated she had also contacted someone from the FBI while I was on scene to report the incident. I provided Moore-Frey with the case number.    Moore-Frey informed me that she has been in contact with the Governors Office, Lt. Colonel Keyser of MSP, Captain Corbin of MSP, Lt. Stonebreaker of MSP, and an FBI agent in reference to these incidents. She also stated that Sergeant Hartsock of MSP had recently visited the facility at their request to establish a plan of action if the health center is attacked.    OBrien was allowed to remain at the location to continue her protest.    All of the above events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
