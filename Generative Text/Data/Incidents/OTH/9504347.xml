         <NarrativeText>MSP Unmarked Vehicle, D-08: In-Car/Body Camera Operational  Case # : 23-MSP-021034 DUI # : 23-153  Arrestee Information:      Defendant: Pencook JR, Paul Anthony      Date of Birth: 09/14/1977      Date of Arrest: June 12, 2023      Time of Arrest: 1103 hours     CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING      Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      Certified in A.R.I.D.E(Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) to enhance skills to observe, identify, and articulate the signs of impairment related to drugs, alcohol, or a combination of both      A distinguished graduate of Marylands DUI Institute, a rigorous 40-hour program that provides specialized training on enforcing laws related to driving under the influence.     VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On June 12, 2023, at approximately 1034 hours, I was on patrol on N/B MD-24 and Singer Road. I was operating an unmarked MSP vehicle, D-08 when I observed a white Ford Mustang with Maryland registration, 1A78873. I noticed the Mustang was driving slower than the normal traffic flow as I watched the three to four cars behind the Mustang in congestion.  As I continued to approach the Mustang from the left lane, I observed the Mustang cross the shoulder line once, both of the passengers side tires crossing over. As I passed the Mustang, I had a clear view of the operator whose physical appearance seemed weary, his eyes appearing heavy. I continued to pass, and the Mustang continued to struggle to maintain its lane and hold up traffic. We came to the intersection of N/B MD 24 and Wheel Road, and once the light came green the Mustang pushed forward, and I again observed the Mustang cross over the shoulder line, again half of the vehicles tires going fully over.  I activated my emergency equipment to initiate a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle came to a complete stop on the shoulder of N/B MD-24 just prior to Bel Air S Pkwy.    PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I made contact with the operator of the vehicle via the drivers side window. I introduced myself, informing him he was being audible and visually recorded and the reason for the traffic stop. I expressed concern for Pencooks driving behavior, explaining that he was holding up traffic and struggling to maintain his lane. Pencook explained that he was working at the junkyard and was on his way home. I asked if Pencook had any drinks of alcoholic beverages, and he denied it. I asked if Pencook had consumed any drugs prior to operating the vehicle, and he denied it again. Pencook provided me with his information and I returned to my patrol vehicle to check it with the MVA.  I returned to Pencooks vehicle, I observed Pencooks physical appearance as if he was weary  tired, his eyelids were low and he spoke slowly. I asked if Pencook would be willing to submit to field sobriety testing, and he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was completed on the right shoulder. The surface was dry, level, and free from any visible debris. The weather was clear and approximately 75 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of natural sunlight.  I asked Pencook the following questions before proceeding with Standard Field Sobriety Testing:  Resting Nystagmus - No.  Medical Conditions/Medications  Suboxone, Depression, and Anxiety.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (2/6 CLUES OBSERVED WHICH INDICATE IMPAIRMENT)  The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained to Pencook before he had begun the test. I asked Pencook if she understood the tests, and he agreed. The following clues and observations were made during this test.      Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Not present in both eyes      The onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Not present in both eyes     *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not present in both eyes  NOTE - Pencook struggled to follow instructions, moving his head which disrupted testing.  WALK AND TURN (3/8 CLUES OBSERVED WHICH INDICATE IMPAIRMENT)  The walk and turn test was explained to Pencook before she had begun the test. II asked Pencook if she understood the tests, and he agreed. The following clues were observed:  Instructional Stage:   Unable to maintain balance  Walking Stage (1st Nine Steps):   Raised arms for balance  Walking Stage (2nd Nine Steps): NOTHING TO NOTE  Turn:   Completed unsatisfactory  ONE LEG STAND (0/4 CLUES OBSERVED WHICH INDICATE IMPAIRMENT)  The one-leg stand test was explained to Pencook before she had begun the test. I asked Pencook if she understood the tests and he agreed. The following clues were observed.  Balance  Count Stage -  Seconds 0-10: N/A  Seconds 11-20: N/A  Seconds 21-30: N/A  ARREST:  Based on the following, I had probable cause to arrest Pencook for driving while impaired:   My observed signs of impairment as Pencook performed field sobriety tests   My observed signs of impairment as Pencook operated the motor vehicle   Admittance to consuming prescribed Suboxone prior to operating the vehicle   Pencook was placed under arrest at 1103 hours. A search of Pencooks person was conducted in front of my patrol vehicle, and nothing of evidentiary value was found.  Pencook was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and was transported to Bel Air Barrack for further processing.  Once at the barrack, I read the DR15 form at 1130 hours and Pencook agreed to submit to a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:  Nothing to report.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: .00  INTOXIMETER TEST ADMINISTERED BY Sergeant Dudek #5037  Pencook refused a DRE evaluation and was released from custody then picked up by his family friend.  I request the case be closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
