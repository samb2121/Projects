         <NarrativeText>Attachments -Screenshots of messages between Suspect(s) and Victim  Victim William Armiger 2/M DOB: 08/31/2004 300 Ponfield Rd W, Forest Hill, MD 21050  Written Statement from Victim I was being blackmailed by two individuals posing as Leslie and Zoe. Each individual was using different explicitly nude pictures I sent to them willingly. The interaction with Leslie started January 2nd late at night where after I was assured she was 18 we had both agreed to exchange nude pictures. These pictures were exchanged in the early morning of January 3rd. Mid-day January 3rd Leslie revealed herself to be not who she said she was and sent me screenshots of my nude photos and the usernames of everyone that follows me. After this, the person demanded money in order to not send my nude pictures to the Instagrams of family and friends. The amount demanded started at 500 dollars and was brought down to a 100-dollar amazon gift card which was purchased in cash at my local Walgreens. After the gift card was sent the person claimed the card was used and continue to demand money, so an additional 46 dollars was sent over to Venmo. During the time of the transactions, my nude photos were sent to an Instagram group chat made by Leslie and she claims to have sent the photos to numerous other Instagram accounts. In total this person received $146 dollars. The second individual claiming to be Zoe initiated a Snapchat message chain with me around midday on January 3rd again assuring me she was 18 and asking for an exchange of nude pictures. After about an hour Zoe then reveals that she too screenshotted the pictures and demanded money to not send them to my Instagram followers which include friends and family. Initially asking for 500 dollars in exchange for not sending out my photos. In an effort to pay off this person, I sent them 100 dollars in a Venmo payment and 200 dollars worth of two separate apple gift cards worth 100 each. As far as I know, Zoe only sent a shirtless picture featuring pants to one group chat. Both individuals stopped messaging me at around 5 pm January 3rd. Screenshots will be attached in labeled files.  Narrative On 1/9/2023, Cpl. Wildman #6591 was assigned to investigate a complaint of sextortion. Cpl. Wildman made telephone contact with the complainant and learned that he sent nude photographs to individuals that he believed that he was an adult female. The complainant was subsequently extorted. The victim authored a written statatement, incorporated above as reference. The victim provided chat screenshots that are uploaded as reference.  This case will be updated upon receipt of responsive information pursuant to subpoenas for suspect account identifiers to electronic service providers.  Case Status OPEN / PENDING  Investigative Time CPL WILDMAN - 4 HOURS</NarrativeText>
