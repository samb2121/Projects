         <NarrativeText>List of Exhibits:  1. Emails from the Office of the Governor.  Person of Interest:  Donte Markiel Jones DOB 10/16/1987 202-855-9865 5750 Castlebridge Road Apartment 201 Fredericksburg, VA 22407  Narrative:  On 10/11/2023 Mr. Frank, Deputy Chief of Staff, from the Office of the Governor, contacted the Maryland Department of State Police (MDSP) Criminal Enforcement Division (CED) regarding an individual that has called Shameka Little Office of Constituent Services. The caller used the telephone number 202-855-9865 and has called over 45 times. The caller identifies himself as Donte Markiel Jones (DOB 10/16/1987) from 5750 Castlebridge Road Apartment 201 Fredericksburg, VA 22407. The last message left by the caller is listed below.  I will be disrespectful. But I had to think about it just that quick move. Dog this Dante Markel Jones 10:16-87. You know who f*** this is 5750 castlebridge Road, Fredericksburg, Virginia. 22407 Mo like apartment 201 bro. Like what the f*** is you doing bro? Like, why does this machine is still operating, bro? Like dog you need to turn this m*********** off bro. Like Im really losing it, bro. Like real s***, bro. Your mother f****** aint delaying this mother f****** message. Im going to be at your mother f****** building. And Im going to and Im going to call the phone and Im going to make sure. Who leave that Im going to come to you? plan You better send that m************ message. Cuz I come to your mother f****** office. Im going to ask whos the latest message. You dont know who I am. and Im going Mother f*****, you better call my mother f****** phone.  In email correspondence between personnel at the Office of the Governor, there was some concern that the caller mentioned coming to the office. Due to this, contact was made with the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center (MCAC). They conducted a workup on the above person of interest. They were not able to confirm the identity of the caller nor link the phone number to the name given by the caller. When running the phone number, it comes back to a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) company.  On 10/12/23 I made contact with the Spotsylvania County Sheriffs Office in Virginia about this incident. They ran the associated address and advised that there was an eviction there on 10/11/23. They did not have a name associated with the eviction. They did not have any relevant information about Jones.  Further investigation revealed that Jones has ties to the Maryland and Washington DC area. There is the belief that his childs mother lives in Prince Georges County.  Additionally, on 10/12/23 contact was made with Ms. Little regarding this incident. She advised that this caller has been calling for some time and that he calls the Governors main phone number which is 410-974-3901. She further advised that the messages he typically leaves have statements such as I promise I will get better by my birthday.  Based on the totality of the situation, MCAC will create and distribute a situational awareness bulletin. This bulletin will be distributed to the MDSP Executive Protection Unit and Legislative Services Section along with the Department of General Services Police to include members of the Office of the Governor.  At this point, no one has told Jones to stop calling, so no crime has been committed. It was recommended to Ms. Little to work with DOiT to have the phone number blocked. This case is closed administratively. </NarrativeText>
