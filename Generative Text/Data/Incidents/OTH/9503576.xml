         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-009615  Incident: TA 21-904 C1: Attempt by drive to elude police in official police veh by failing to stop  Date/ Time: 03/17/2023, 0012 hours  Location of Offense: E/B MD 140 at Baltimore/ Carroll County line, Finksburg, Carroll County, MD.  Incident recorded on AXON digital recording system assigned to G-39 and AXON body camera assigned to me.  Attachments:  -copy of MVA records  Training  Qualifications:  -MSP Academy, June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007  -I am trained and certified to operate a Kustom Golden Eagle II RADAR, set G-39. All records are kept on file at the MSP Electronic Services Division and Westminster Barrack, the unit was found to be in working order prior to and following the stop, and was used in accordance to MSP policy, my training, and the manufacturers guidelines. My certification is non-expiring.  Driver/ Defendant:  MD DL C-324-478-522-121 KREG LINZEY CUTSAIL 2836 CEDARHURST RD FINKSBURG, MD 21048 2/M, DOB 02/15/1989 240-522-9921  Neighborhood Check:  The area was saturated and checked without success.  Scene Processing:  None completed due to the nature of the incident.  Narrative:  On 03/17/2023 at approximately 0013 hours, I was on duty, in uniform, operating a marked MSP patrol vehicle: G-39. I was also utilizing a Kustom Golden Eagle II RADAR unit (which I am trained and certified to operate through the Maryland State Police, all records are kept on file at the MSP Electronic Services Division and Westminster Barrack, the unit was found to be in working order prior to and following the stop, and was used in accordance to MSP policy, my training, and the manufacturers guidelines). I was traveling W/B MD 140 entering Carroll County from Baltimore County, MD. I observed a single vehicle traveling E/B MD 140 at what appeared to be above the posted speed limit of 50 mph. I had the RADAR unit activated in opposite direction moving mode, and obtained a speed reading of 70 mph in the posted 50 mph. The vehicle was the only vehicle in the field of influence for the RADAR unit. The vehicle is described as a gray 2003 Buick passenger vehicle, displaying Virginia registration TTP8081. I was able to get behind the vehicle and initiate a traffic stop. The vehicle came to a stop in the parking lot of the Full Moon Bar  Grille, located at 1100 Westminster Pike, Reisterstown, Baltimore County, MD. I was able to observe the vehicle had two occupants: white male driver and white female front passenger.  As I approached the vehicle, the vehicle then took off from the stop, screeching tires, and traveled down Glenn Falls Rd, inside Baltimore County, MD, at a high rate of speed. The vehicle was not followed/ pursued.  An extensive check of the area was made to attempt to locate the vehicle both in Carroll and Baltimore Counties. The vehicle was not able to be located. The driver is described as a white male, appeared to be of larger/ taller build, short brown hair, and goatee. MVA photo comparisons made with subjects known to have been previously operating the vehicle for traffic stops, led me to be able to identify the driver as KREG LINZEY CUTSAIL, a white male with a date of birth of 02/15/1989, as the operator of the vehicle on 03/17/2023 at 0012 hours. I was able to positively identity the driver as CUTSAIL through MVA photo comparison and previous police contacts. The areas initially checked for the vehicle included CUTSAILs address of 2836 Cedarhurst Rd, Finksburg, Carroll County, MD, Westminster, MD, as well as the address to which the vehicle was registered:2 Park Mills Ct, Reisterstown, Baltimore County, MD 21136. The vehicle was not located at this time.  On 04/23/2023 at approximately 0800 hours, I attempted to make contact with CUTSAIL at his address of 2836 Cedarhurst Rd, Finksburg, Carroll County, MD. The vehicle (VA registrationTTP8081) was present at that location at this time. The instant CUTSAIL was made aware of my presence and while I was inside the residence, he ran out the rear of the residence through an exterior access basement door. I immediately ran outside and was not able to observe CUTSAIL in any direction. CUTSAIL was called by several family members and advised I was there to give him a copy of the traffic citations for the incident of 03/17/2023 at 0012 hours. CUTSAIL refused to return to the residence. CUTSAILs mother advised me that her son,KREG LINZEY CUTSAIL,got the vehicle from a friend, was the only person in the residence known to operate that vehicle, and the only person in the residence with the keys to the vehicle. I placed the traffic citations LJJ0DJH-LJP0DJH, the Notice to Right of Counsel, and Notice to Appear under the passenger side windshield wiper of the Buick passenger vehicle.  I request the case be considered closed on citations.  The original traffic violations occurred in Carroll County, MD. </NarrativeText>
