         <NarrativeText>Alcohol Influence :   On 02/05/2023 at approximately 1532 hrs, M/T Lechliter and I were dispatched by the Cumberland Barrack to respond to Rt 36 and Iron Rail Street, Mt Savage, for a report of a motor vehicle collision. While en route to the collision the barrack advised they had obtained information that the collision was serious in nature and there were multiple injuries.   Upon my arrival I observed 2 vehicles in the roadway, both with severe front end damage. One vehicle was a Ford Taurus and the other a Kia Forte. Due to numerous injuries, 5 between the two vehicles, there were numerous emergency responders on the scene treating all victims.   M/T Lechliter, who arrived prior to myself, was able to briefly speak with the operator of one of the vehicles, the Ford Taurus, Mikayla Filer, who advised M/T Lechliter that the other vehicle had came into her lane and struck her vehicle head on. It was discovered that the Ford Taurus was also occupied by 2 children that were in the rear seat of the vehicle. All occupants in that vehicles were being treated for injuries and were all taken by ambulance to UPMC Western Maryland.   I attempted to get as much information as possible from the 2nd vehicle, Kia Forte, however the operator of that vehicle appeared to have serious injuries and was being attended to by several medics. I was not able to get close to the operator at that time. It was discovered that the vehicle was also occupied by a child that was in the rear seat, who also appeared to have a serious injury and was being treated by medics. I was able to identify the operator as Dylan Tanner Roy, W/M, DOB 08/18/1997 and the child as his son, Jase.   Due to the above facts I was not able to talk to or even get close to occupants. ( See ACRS report for additional information regarding the collision )    After the above I was told that both the driver and passenger in the Kia Forte were being transported up the road to a landing zone, that both were being flown out by MSP Medevac helicopters Trooper 5 and Trooper 3, and both were being taken to Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, WV.   After the above and due to the serious injuries in the collision, a re-constructionist from MSP was requested. Cpl. D. Diehl responded for the reconstruction.   At some point during the investigation, I was advised that the operator of the Kia Forte, Dylan Tanner Roy, who was determined to also be the at fault, advised one of the medics on the scene that he had been drinking. At the time I could not verify that.   Due to the above facts, a subpoena is being prepared to send to Ruby Memorial Hospital requesting medical records for Mr. Dylan Roy.   On Feburary 6, 2023 the barrack obtained information from Maryland Child Protective Services. The information obtained was the agency had been contacted by Ruby Memorial Hospital in regard to a child neglect complainant as result of this collision.The complaint stated that Dylan Tanner Roy had a blood alcohol content of .15, therefore the complainant stemmed from him transporting his son, who was the rear seat passenger, in that condition.   Due to the above facts I am requesting this case remain open, pending service and results of the subpoena being sent to Ruby. Once that information is obtained, the States Attorney will be consulted as to what charges to pursue.      </NarrativeText>

The Ford was traveling South at the same location. The passenger side of the Kia struck the concrete wall along the edge of the roadway. The front right portion of the Kia then struck the corner of a stone wall along the side of the roadway. The impact with the stone wall caused the Kia to travel into the southbound lane directly in front of the Ford. The front of the Kia struck the front of the Ford. The impact caused the Kia to travel back into the northbound lane where it came to final rest. The Ford came to final rest in the southbound lane.  The driver, Dylan Roy, and passenger, Jase Roy, of the Kia were Flown to Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia. Dylan Roy was not wearing his seat belt at the time of this collision.
