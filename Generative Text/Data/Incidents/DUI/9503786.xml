         <NarrativeText>J-07 equipped with a mobile recording device, this stop was recorded. This stop was also recorded on body worn camera.  Defendant: Joseph Robert Sullivan Date of Birth: 10/10/1986 Date of Arrest: 01/14/2023 Time of Arrest: 0058 hours MD SDX: MD-10272423453 DUI #: 23-003  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Apprehended more than 155 impaired drivers during my career with the Maryland State Police to date. *ARIDE (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement)    VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On Friday January 14, 2023 at approximately 0045 hours, I, TFC. Lowe #6739, was in uniform of the day, operating unmarked MSP vehicle, J-07. At that time, I was in the area of Rowe Blvd and Taylor Ave, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, MD 21401, conducting stationary laser speed enforcement. While monitoring traffic, I observed a vehicle abruptly change lanes from lane 2 to lane 1 and accelerate. I placed the Pro Laser 4 on the front of the vehicle and obtained a speed of 67 MPH in a posted 40 MPH zone. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on a tan Chevrolet Malibu bearing Maryland registration, 2EZ3910.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I approached the vehicle via a driver side approach. Immediately upon my approach, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. I made contact with the male operator and advised him the reason for the stop was for his speed. The male advised he was going to buy a lighter. I asked for his license and registration which he was able to provide. I identified the male driver by his Maryland drivers license as Joseph Robert Sullivan, W/M, DOB: 10/10/1986 (hereinafter referred to as Sullivan.) While Sullivan reached for his registration, I asked if he still lived at the address on his license and he advised no and gave me his current address. While speaking with Sullivan, I noticed his eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I asked Sullivan how much alcohol he had consumed, and he replied, A little bit. Sullivan then immediately said, Please, I can park the car. I advised Sullivan to remain in the vehicle and I returned to my vehicle.   A routine check through the MVA database revealed that Sullivan was driving on valid Maryland license. On my second approach, I stated to Sullivan that I wanted to make sure he was okay to drive and asked him to exit the vehicle for standardized field sobriety tests. He agreed and exited the vehicle. I advised Sullivan to walk to the front of his vehicle and he complied.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed roadside. The surface wasdry, and clear from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 39 degrees. My patrol vehicles front emergency equipment lights were deactivated during all three tests. I observed Sullivanto be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. Sullivan was asked the following questions:    margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Do you have any medical conditions or injuries-Ruptured disk in back   margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Are you on any medications No   margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Do you wear glasses or contacts?  No   While communicating with Sullivan at the front of his vehicle, I again detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage, this time emitting from his breath and person.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6 out of 6 clues observed)  The first test that was given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus.Sullivan stated he understood the instructions.Sullivandisplayed the following clues:  Sullivan had equal pupil size and equal tracking,and no resting nystagmus.          Lack of Smooth Pursuit-Present in both eyes   Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation-Present in both eyes    margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees-Present in both eyes        WALK AND TURN (6 out of 8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA manual. Sullivanunderstood the instructions. Sullivandisplayed the following clues: Instructional Stage:    Sullivan continued to put his left foot in front of his right instead of right in front of left.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Sullivan failed to maintain the instructional position.   Walking Stage (1st nine):    Raised arms more than 6 inches from sides the entire set of steps.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Took a series of 16 steps  Turn:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Turned to the right  Walking Stage (2nd nine)    Stopped walking after the turn and on step 4.  Stepped off-line on step 4.  Took a series of 17 steps.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Raised arms more than 6 inches on all steps.     ONE LEG STAND (3 out of 4 clues observed)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA manual. Sullivanstated he understood the instructions. Sullivandisplayed the following clues:    Swayed and almost fell off balance on count 1011  Used arms for balance on counts 1011, 1012 and 1013.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Put foot down on count 1013.   Sullivan did not pick his foot back up to continue the test.  While on scene, Sullivan submitted to a preliminary breath test with a result of .17.  ARREST   Based on the following, I had reason to believe SULLIVAN was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from vehicle/breath.  Eyes glassy and bloodshot.  Admission to consuming alcohol   Clues during standardized field sobriety   margin-left:8px"&gt;Positive preliminary testing.    Due to the number of observations, I concluded SULLIVAN was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0058 hours, I placed SULLIVAN under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. A preliminary search of SULLIVAN was conducted on scene and there were no foreign objects in his mouth. SULLIVAN was transported to the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack for processing.   20-Minute Observation Period  A secondary search was conducted upon arrival at the Barrack and revealed that SULLIVAN had nothing in his mouth prior to the time he was asked to submit to the test. The DR-15 Advice of Rights were read to Sullivan at 0118 hours in English via MVA audio. Sullivan was also provided a copy to read over at which time he elected to submit to the breath test. Cpl. Anderson #6354 of the Maryland State Police administered the test. The test revealed that Sullivan had an alcohol concentration of .15 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  SULLIVAN was polite and cooperative the entire process.   SULLIVAN was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released.   All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
