I responded to the arear of W/B MD 140 at Sandymount Rd, Finksburg, Carroll County, MD, for a report of a possible impaired driver. I was advised by MSP Westminster dispatch the vehicle made a left turn onto Sandymount Rd, toward Old Westminster Pike, then W/B on Old Westminster Pike, then S/B on Bollinger Rd. I was able to located the vehicle, described as a white 2013 Buick 4 door passenger car with Maryland tags 3BY0131, S/B on Bollinger Rd, N/O Hook Rd. I was able to observe the vehicle drive with the driver side tires over the double yellow center line, and initiated a traffic stop on that vehicle by activating my patrol vehicles emergency equipment (specifically my overhead red and blue lights). The vehicle came to a stop off of the roadway, in front of 1420 Bollinger Rd, Finksburg, Carroll County, MD. The weather was cloudy and approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  Phase II: Contact:  I approached the vehicle on the drivers side of the vehicle. The window was already down and I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. I was able to observe the vehicle was occupied by a white male driver. I made contact with the driver, identified myself, advised the stop was being recorded, and stated the reasons for the traffic stop. I made the following observations of the driver:  -eyes glassy and bloodshot -strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the drivers breath and vehicles passenger compartment -moderate odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle -driver was wearing purple sneakers, gray pants, and black t-shirt  I recognized the odor of marijuana based on my training, experience, and knowledge gained with the Maryland State Police. I asked the driver how long ago had he last consumed marijuana. The driver advised probable about, uh, 9 oclock (9am). I did observe the drivers Maryland Medical cannabis card, which he did display upon request. The driver initially not able to locate his drivers license. The driver was identified by name and date of birth (subsequently verified by MVA photo comparison and his located MD DL) to be AUSTIN COLE HAYNES, DOB 03/16/2001. I had the driver exit the vehicle to separate him from the odor emanating from the vehicle, and to conduct a probable cause search of the vehicle based on the odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle. The driver did admit to the presence of marijuana in the vehicle. I asked the driver if he was on medications and he stated he is on anti-depressants (last taken between 8-9am today, dosage recently adjusted).  I conducted a detailed search of the vehicle, based on the detected and recognized odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle. The following items were located and seized:  A. one red colored grinder, containing item B, located in front of the gear shift B. green plant matter (marijuana), 6.6 grams  The grinder and its contents were not labeled as THC or marijuana, or with the drivers name and/ or Maryland Medical Cannabis patient number as required.

The plant matter was recognized through my training and experience with the Maryland State Police to be marijuana (a Controlled Dangerous Substance of Schedule 1). Addition marijuana was located in the vehicle, however, was properly labeled as required. Per the current agreement with the CCSAO, the driver was not charged with the marijuana violation.  The driver was able to provide his MD DL after finally locating it within his wallet. I had the driver move to the approximately level driveway of 1420 Bollinger Rd for further questions.  Q.

While speaking with the driver, I made the following observations:  -strong odor of alcoholic beverage on breath and person -eyes glassy and bloodshot -moderate odor of burnt marijuana on breath and person  Based on my observations of the driver, the traffic violation I observed, and drivers admittance of consuming medications w/ marijuana, I made the decision to administer the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.

Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus:  The drivers eyes displayed equal pupil size, tracking, and reaction.

The driver was instructed, when told to do so, to close their eyes and tilt their head backward. I would then give the command, either right or left, and the driver is to touch the tip of their nose with the tip of their index finger, then immediately bring their arm back down to their side. I provided the following commands: left, right, left, right, right, left.  Observations:  -swayed side to side and front to back during the test -missed tip of nose: touched upper lip, right nostril, -held finger in place for a few seconds -used pad of finger not fingertip as demonstrated and instructed -strong odor of alcoholic beverage on breath and person -eyes glassy and bloodshot -moderate odor of burnt marijuana on breath and person  Modified Romberg:  The driver was placed in the instructional position: arms down to their side and heels together.

The result of the PBT was 0.11 BrAC. I asked the driver what was he drinking, and the driver advised he was drinking mixed drinks while house sitting. Based on my observations of the driver during contact and the SFSTs, I made the decision to place the driver under arrest for DUI. The driver was advised he was under arrest, handcuffed, and placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle for transport to the MSP Westminster Barrack.
