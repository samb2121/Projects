         <NarrativeText>M-19 In-Car/Body Camera Operational   Defendant: Keyonna Caprice McCormick   Date of Birth: 11/6/1998  Date of Arrest: 3/16/2023  Time of Arrest: 0107  DUI #: 23-026    Phase 1- Vehicle In Motion  On 3/16/2023, I, Trooper Myers was sitting on the left shoulder of I-95 at the 81.8MM with my rear emergency equipment activated on marked Maryland State Police vehicle M-19. I began to merge back onto I-95 when I observed a vehicle with an inoperable right front headlight travel from lane 2 to lane 1 almost striking my patrol vehicle. I began following the vehicle, a 2017 blue Mercedes C300 MD registration 4EW9878, and observed the following: the vehicle crossed over the solid yellow line on the left two times, the vehicle was traveling between lanes 1 and 2, and the vehicle was varying speeds (speeding up then slowing down). I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle began going across the lanes onto the right shoulder, but pulled back into lane 3 and stopped. I exited my patrol vehicle and directed the driver to pull to the right shoulder at the 80MM on S/B I-95.    Phase 2- Personal Contact  Upon my initial approach, I made contact with the driver, Keyonna Caprice McCormick, identified by her Maryland drivers license and advised her of the reason for the stop. I observed a glass mason jar in the center cup holder with a liquid (later discovered emitting a smell of an alcoholic beverage) and fresh cherries in the jar, but McCormick stated it was an old drink. The vehicle also had heavy front passenger and side damage, but McCormick stated that it was old damage. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle, McCormicks eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and her speech was slurred. I asked McCormick where she was coming from and how much she had to drink, she stated Park Heights, Maryland from a restaurant and one Mai Tai cocktail. Based on the above observations, I asked McCormick to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests which she agreed.   Phase #3- Pre-Arrest Screening  I asked McCormick the following questions:  Medications - No  Any injuries to affect the Standardized field sobriety tests- No  Contacts/Glasses- No  I am trained through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in performing Standard Field Sobriety Tests. The tests were performed on a smooth surface free of any debris and light was provided by my vehicles headlamps, vehicle spotlight, and a flashlight.  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. A black ballpoint pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from McCormicks eyes. McCormick was instructed to put her feet together and hands down by her side. McCormick was instructed not to move her head and follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only. McCormicks pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. While standing in front of McCormick, I was able to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. McCormick stated she understood the test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus- 6 of 6 clues  Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to Reaching 45- Present in both eyes.  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Detected.    The second test offered was the Walk and Turn test- 4 of 8 clues  Prior to performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. McCormick was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. McCormick was instructed to put her hands down by her side and stay in this position until told to begin. McCormick was demonstrated and explained to take nine (9) heel-to-toe steps on a straight line touching heel-to-toe on every step. McCormick was to keep her hands flat to her side, keep her eyes on her feet, and count every step out loud. On the ninth step, McCormick was demonstrated and explained to keep her lead foot planted and take a series of small steps to turn around. McCormick was then explained and demonstrated that the second series of steps were to be performed identically to the first nine steps. McCormick was told that once she began the test she could not stop. McCormick stated she understood the test and was comfortable with the shoes she was wearing.  (A)First 9 steps-  McCormick took incorrect steps and stopped walking  I advised that the test was explained as 9 heel-to-toe steps. McCormick returned to the starting position and began the test a second time and the following was observed-  (B) First nine steps-  Did not touch heel to toe on all steps  Second Nine Steps:  McCormick raised her arms on step 5    The next test offered was the One Leg Stand- 3 of 4 clues  Prior to performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. McCormick was instructed to stand with her feet together and hands down by her side while instructions were given and during the test. McCormick was instructed not to start the test until told and not until after I demonstrated it. When instructed to start, McCormick was to raise the foot of her choice approximately six (6) inches from the ground. While her foot was raised she was to keep her foot parallel to the ground and count out loud by thousands and to continue the test until told to stop (30 seconds). McCormick was asked if she understood the test and the instructions that were given, and she asked me to explain the test again. After the second demonstration and explanation, McCormick stated she understood. McCormick chose to raise her right foot.  Balance and Counting Phase:  0-10 seconds-  McCormick raised her arms, swayed, and put her foot down.  11-20 seconds-  McCormick raises her arms  21-30 seconds-  McCormick put her foot down.  During the test when McCormick reached one thousand nine she then began counting over again at one thousand one. At 30 seconds, McCormick had counted to one thousand four. After placing her foot down during the final 21-30 seconds she did not resume and stated she was cold. McCormick was reminded during the test to keep her hands down by her side.  McCormick was offered a preliminary breath test which she refused.  Based on the above observations, I believed McCormick was unable to operate a vehicle safely, and she was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0107 hours on 3/16/2023.  Prior to being placed into my patrol vehicle, McCormick stated she was not drunk and could drive. McCormick stated she lost her keys and phone. McCormicks vehicle was unable to be locked and was towed by Sullivans Garage.  During transport to the JFK Highway Barrack, McCormicks speech was slurred, and a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from her breath and person. McCormick asked multiple times why she was pulled over which was explained multiple times. McCormick asked me to give her a work slip. McCormick fell asleep during transport to the JFK Highway Barrack.  McCormick was transported to the JFK Highway Barrack for processing. While at the Barrack, McCormick was read her DR 15 Advice of Rights form. McCormick refused to submit to the intoximeter test at 0141 hours on 3/16/2023. McCormick began acting very uncooperative at the barrack, refusing to remove her jewelry, and becoming very argumentative.  McCormick was released from the JFK Highway Barrack to a sober driver, Christine S Leazer (DOB 8/24/1982)  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.                </NarrativeText>
