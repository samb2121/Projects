         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured by BWC. J-31 is not equipped with an in-car camera. Defendant: Blackett, Jailan Elliot-Anthony Date of Birth: 10/26/1999 Date of Arrest: 07/29/2023 Time of Arrest: 0035 Hours DUI #: J-23-142 (Annapolis Barrack)  CERTIFICATION  TRAINING -NHSTA Trained/certified to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST)  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 07/29/2023, at approximately 0016 hours I, Trooper Alvarado #7429, of the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack, was on-duty in uniform of the day operating Marked Unit J-31 traveling in the area of Westbound US-50 East of Davidsonville Rd in Anne Arundel County, MD. I observed a White Chevy Spark bearing Maryland Registration 1FJ2604 traveling in lane 2 in the area of Westbound US-50 East of Davidsonville Rd. While maintaining a steady and constant speed of 85 mph in a 65 mph zone behind the White Chevy,I observed that the vehicle was unable to maintain its lane, initially drifting into lane 1 before drifting into lane 3. Upon observing these violations, I activated the emergency equipment on my patrol vehicle and initiated a traffic stop.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2). I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver via the passenger-side window. I deliberately looked into his eyes and observed that they were bloodshot red and glassy. I immediately smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I identified the driver by his Maryland Drivers License as Blackett, Jailan Elliot-Anthony DOB 10/26/1999. I explained to Blackett that I observed he was unable to maintain his designated lane direction while also speeding, to which he admitted to. I questioned him about his origin and destination. Blackett informed me that he was coming from the St. Marys County Military base where he works and was trying to get to a Suitland Metro Station nearby. Blacketts responses were slowed and slurred when speaking.  Based on these observations, I requested Blackett perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Test to which he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The test was performed on a flat surface and free of any debris on the right shoulder in front of Blacketts vehicle. I asked the driver the following questions: Any physical defects: No Sick or injured-No On any medication prescribed or recreational- No Wear glasses or special contacts- Yes, contacts but it would not prevent him performing the HGN test.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The horizontal gaze nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST manual. I askedBlackett if he understood the tests instructions and he replied that he did.  Blacketts pupils were equal in size and displayed equal tracking. I also observed Blackett displaying a Lack of Smooth Pursuit, Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation and an Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. Vertical Nystagmus was also present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (5/8 Clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST manual. I asked Blackett if he understood the instructions and he replied that he did.  Instruction phase: *Cannot keep balance  he was unable to keep his balance on a few occasions and stepped out of the instructional position.  First 9 steps: Missed all heel-to-toe steps He raised his arms from his side during the entire first set of 9 steps. Stepped off line for the entire set of 9 steps. Did not walk in a straight line.  Second set of 9 steps: Missed all heel-to-toe steps He raised his arms from his side during the entire second set of 9 steps. Stepped off line for the entire set of 9 steps. Did not walk in a straight line  Did not keep lead foot planted during turn. ONE LEG STAND (3/4) Clues observed The test was explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST manual. I asked Blackett if he understood the instructions, and he replied that he did. He raised his left foot.  During the test he was swaying to the left and right in order to control his balance. His arms were raised for the entirety of the one legged stand. He put his foot down one time at the 11 second mark, one time at the 20 second mark and three more times during the 24-28 second marks.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST PBT was offered and refused  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe thatBlackett was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.  *Unable to maintain vehicles designated lane direction. *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. *Slow and slurred speech. *Bloodshot red and glassy eyes. * HGN 6/6 clues detected. * Walk and Turn 5/8 clues detected. *One Leg Stand 3/4 clues detected.  I arrested Blackett for driving while impaired at 0035 hours on 07/29/2023.Blackett was transported to Annapolis Barrack for processing. While he was inside my patrol vehicle, the entire vehicle smelled like the odor of an alcoholic beverage. Additionally, Blackett admitted to drinking one alcoholic beverage prior to driving his vehicle while in my patrol vehicle.  At the Annapolis BarrackBlackett was read the DR-15 Advice of Rights in its entirety. After the DR-15 Advice of Rights,Blackett refused to submit to the chemical breath test and signed the DR-15 at 0107 hours on 07/29/2023.  Blackettwas issued all appropriate citations and paperwork.Blackett was then released to a sober-driver at the Annapolis Barrack.  All events occurred in both Anne Arundel County Maryland.  Cleared by arrest. </NarrativeText>
