         <NarrativeText>This stop was audibly and visually recorded using the Axon Digital Video Camera System installed in Maryland State Police Unit, U-25, and my Axon III Body Worn Camera.  DUI #: 23-066  MD Soundex: MD10273157193  On August 1, 2023 at approximately 2032 hours, I, TFC R. Backus #6648 was on uniformed patrol in my unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle, U-25, with Tpr. E.Barrientos #7396. I was northbound on MD Route 4 at Ward Rd, Dunkirk, MD 20754. I observed a blue Toyota 2-door Corolla Matrix bearing MD registration 6BFR86, with an inoperable right brake light.  I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on MD Route 4 at Ward Rd. The vehicle did not immediately stop, slowly making a right turn into the parking lot of Dominos located at10367 Southern Maryland Blvd, Dunkirk, MD 20754.  I made contact with the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, Jonathan Allen James (W/M DOB 07/31/1981). I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. James advised that he had one drink prior to being stopped. I observed a plastic Coca-Cola bottle partially filled with liquid located in the front passenger seat. The color of the liquid was not consistent with Coca-Cola. James advised the liquid may be liquor.  Based on my observations, I asked James to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  I asked James to place his feet together and place his hands at his sides. James advised he had no injuries and was not taking any medication.  The SFSTs were performed in front of my vehicle in the parking lot of Dominos. It was flat, level, and was free of debris or obstructions. The weather was cloudy. The SFSTs were performed with the following results:  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): (6/6)  James was instructed to stand with his feet together, his hands at his sides and to look straight ahead. James was instructed to hold his head still during the test and follow the stimulus with his eyes only. James was then asked if he understood the instructions and he acknowledged that he understood my instructions.  Placing my stimulus approximately 12  15 inches away from James, I then checked his eyes for equal pupil size, equal tracking, and any signs of resting Nystagmus. This is done to check for any kind of possible medical disorder or injury that might exhibit a form of Nystagmus. I saw none of these in James eyes.  1. James eyes displayed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. 2. James eyes displayed distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. 3. James eyes displayed the onset of Nystagmus prior to forty-five degrees in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (WAT): (5/8)  I explained the test to James as I demonstrated it. James acknowledged that he understood my instructions and was ready to begin the test. The Walk and Turn Test yielded the following results:  INSTRUCTION STAGE:  James was unable to maintain his balance in the starting position moving his feet from the heel to toe position.  WALKING STAGE:  James stepped off-line several times on the first series of 9 steps. James missed heel to toe by more than  inch on several steps taken on the first series of 9 steps. James raised his arms for balance more than 6 inches from his side on the first series of 9 steps. James completed an improper turn by taking small steps with both feet. James missed heel to toe by more than  inch on several steps taken on the second series of 9 steps.  ONE LEG STAND (OLS): (3/4)  I explained the test to James as I demonstrated it. He acknowledged he understood my instructions. When he began the test, James balanced on his left foot.  James put his foot down at 20 seconds. James swayed several times during the test. James lifted his arms more than 6 inches from his side at 20 seconds.  James was offered a preliminary breath test but refused.  James was placed under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol at approximately 2044 hours. James was transported to the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack at approximately 2054 hours. At the Barrack, James was read his DR-15, Advice of Rights, on 08/01/2023 at approximately 2128 hours at which time he refused to submit to the intoximeter test.  James was charged accordingly for DUI and released to a sober driver.  Case closed.  All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.      </NarrativeText>
