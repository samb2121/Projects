         <NarrativeText>DUI CASE # 23-96-162 SUSPECT: BRYAN WILLIAM STARKEY 8/16/2002 LICENSE # S362098887640 DUI CITATION #4BT0URD SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER: NO ACCIDENT INVOLVED: NO VIDEO: MARYLAND STATE POLICE UNIT V-5 EQUIPPED WITH VIDEO RECORDING EQUIPMENT NARRATIVE  Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion: On 6/12/2023 at 2315 hours, I, TFC Brader was operating unmarked patrol vehicle V-5 in the area of North Division Street and Baltimore Ave in Ocean City, Worcester County MD. I was traveling in lane 1. In lane 2 directly next to my vehicle, I observed a gray Hyundai Santa Fe Bearing MD registration 1EN8375. I observed the Hyundai to not have its headlights or tail lights illuminated when required due to it being dark. I activated my emergency lights to conduct a traffic stop on the Hyundai. The Hyundai pulled into a parking lot off Baltimore Ave. Phase #2 - Personal Contact I exited my vehicle and approached drivers side window. I identified myself and explained to the driver for the reason of the traffic stop. I observed the headlight switch to the left of the steering wheel to be placed in the off position. The driver advised he forgot to turn on his automatic lights. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath as he spoke to me. I requested the drivers license and registration card. The driver provided me with his MD License and I identified him as Bryan Starkey (DOB: 8/16/2002). I observed Starkeys eyes to be bloodshot and glassy as he looked at my direction. After Starkey handed me his license, I observed him to stare at me. I again asked for the registration card and he was able to provide it. I asked Starkey how many alcoholic beverages he consumed, and he stated not that much. I asked Starkey what he considered not much was, and he stated not much.  I requested Starkey to remain in the vehicle. I returned to my vehicle and provided dispatch with Starkeys information. I was advised Starkey had an J alcohol restriction on his license due to him being 20 years old.  Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening I approached drivers side window and requested Starkey to exit the vehicle to continue with my investigation. Starkey did as I asked. I explained to Starkey for the reason of having him exit the vehicle and he understood. I asked Starkey where he was coning from, and he stated a friends house on 8th street. Starkey mentioned he was going back to his rental on 3rd street. I asked Starkey how any alcoholic beverages he consumed and he stated 1 beer, maybe two. While speaking with Starkey, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I continued to observe Starkeys eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I observed Starkey to be wearing shorts, a shirt and shoes.  I asked Starkey if he has any disabilities, and he stated no. I asked Starkey if he is wearing contacts, and he stated he was. I asked Starkey if he has any injuries or illness and he stated no. I asked Starkey if he has any medical disorders or disabilities and he stated no. I asked Starkey if he was in overall good health, and he stated yes.  Starkey agreed to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and I began with the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Resting Nystagmus: NO Equal Tracking: YES Equal Pupil Size: YES  Lack of smooth pursuit in: Present both eyes Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation: Present in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees: Present in both eyes    Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues6 of 6 Walk and Turn I next explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn Test to Starkey. Weather: Clear Surface: Flat blacktop surface free of any debris Instruction Stage No clues observed Walking Stage 1st 9 Stepped off line on step 6 by more than his own foot width. Took 10 steps down the line, contrary to my instructions. Turn Pivoted on both feet, contrary to my instruction. Walking Stage 2nd 9 No clues observed Total Walk and Turn Clues3 of 8 One Leg Stand I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand Test to Starkey. Starkey advised he understood the instructions and began the test by raining his right foot.

Preliminary Breath Test I explained the reasons for using a preliminary breath test and asked Starkey if he would submit a breath sample. Starkey agreed to submit a breath sample. Starkeys breath result was .077 BrAC. Arrest and Transport At 2331 hours, I placed Starkey under arrest. I placed Starkey in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. I then entered the driver seat of my patrol vehicle and began to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present prior to placing Starkey into my patrol vehicle. I provided Starkey with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. I played the MVA Audio Version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to Starkey and after the recording was completed, Starkey advised refuses to submit to the breath test. Starkey mentioned he knew he should not have drove the vehicle. Starkey mentioned he knew what was happening when he was pulled over and that is why he was honest.  Starkeys vehicle was located and secured and he was released after the paperwork was completed.  Starkey was polite and cooperative during the entire encounter.   Starkey was charged with the following: 1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol 21-902(a1) 2) Driving While Impaired by Alcohol 21-902(b1) 3) Driving Motor Vehicle with Alcohol in Blood in Violation of Restriction 16113(j)  All events did occur in Worcester County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
