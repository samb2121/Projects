         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack N Marked MSP vehicle N-15 In-Car and Body Camera Operational   Defendant: Henry Garcia Barillas  Date of Birth: 07/06/1992  Date of Arrest: 09/29/2023  Time of Arrest: 2352 hours  DUI #: 23-203 (Rockville Barrack)  CERTIFICATION  TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement through the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 09/29/2023 at approximately2311 hours, I (TFC Satterfield #7216) was patrolling southbound on I-270 in the area of Old Georgetown Road in lane 4. I was driving marked MSP vehicle N-15 which is up-to-date on calibration and maintenance. I noticed a black Toyota Corolla bearing Maryland registration 7EP2940 exceeding the speed limit. I paced the vehicle for 1 mile and speed was 70 MPH in a 55 MPH zone. The vehicle also crossed over the solid white line from the ramp to Old Georgetown to get back onto southbound I-270. At that point, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the driver identified as Henry Garcia Barillas (H/M DOB 07/06/1992) by his Maryland Drivers License. I introduced myself to Garcia Barillas and informed him the reason for the stop. As I spoke to Garcia Barillas, I smelled a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I asked Garcia Barillas where he was coming from and if he had anything to drink tonight. Garcia Barillas advised he did consume acholic beverages and was coming from a restaurant. I asked Garcia Barilla how many drinks he had, and he advised four drinks. Garcia Barilla did not speak fluid English and TFC Canizalez #7087 responded to the scene. Hereafter, all statements made to and from Garcia Barillas was translated by TFC Canizalez. Garcia Barillas advised he had four canned Coronas about an hour prior to driving. Garcia Barillas consented to perform standardized field sobriety tests.  PRE- ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of Sorthbound I-270 at Old Georgetown Road. The surface was dry and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, and my flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Garcia Barillas did not display any visible injuries. All the SFST were demonstrated to Garcia Barillas before his attempts. Garcia Barillas stated he had no injuries or physical impairment that would prevent him from completing the tests.  I asked the following questions: Medical Conditions  No Injuries  No Medication  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 CLUES) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. My fingertip was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Garcia Barillas eyes. Garcia Barillas was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Garcia Barillas pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I asked Garcia Barilla if he understood the directions and he stated that he did.Garcia Barilla was positioned away from passing traffic to ensure the results of the HGN test were not compromised.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Not present 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) Prior to Garcia Barillas performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Garcia Barillas was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Garcia Barillas was instructed to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Garcia Barilla was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Garcia Barillas was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Garcia Barillas was demonstrated and explained to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Garcia Barillas was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Garcia Barillas was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Garcia Barillas if he completely understood the instructions to which headvised he did.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Starts too soon  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on almost every step 2.) Took 20 steps  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Stepped of line on steps 3 and 4 2.) Used arms to balance on step 3 3.) Took 11 steps  Turn: Garcia Barilas completed the turn improperly. He did not take a series of small steps to turn around but twisted around instead.   ONE LEG STAND (2/4 CLUES) Prior to Garcia Barillas performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Garcia Barillas was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. Garcia Barillas was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Garcia Barillas was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he advised he did.  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Nothing to report  Seconds 11-20: 1.) Put foot down multiple times.  Seconds 21-30 1.) Put foot down multiple times.  2.) Swayed  Garcia Barillas agreed to submit to apreliminarybreath test with a result of .17  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Garcia Barillas was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from breath. * Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages * Speeding 70 MPH in 55 MPH zone * Failure to obey designated lane directions * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests   I arrested Garcia Barillas for driving under the influence of alcohol at 2340 hours, and he was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Rockville Barrack for processing. At the barrack, I gave Garcia Barillas a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to follow along as he listened to the audio form being read to him in its entirety. At the conclusion of the form, Garcia Barillas agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same (0020 hours).  INTOXIMETER RESULT  font-size:14.6667px"&gt;.16 BAC  Garcia Barillas was issued the appropriate paperwork and released to a sober and licensed driver. All events occurred in MontgomeryCounty, State of Maryland. Case closed            </NarrativeText>
