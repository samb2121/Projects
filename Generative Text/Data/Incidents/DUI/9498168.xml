         <NarrativeText>This incident was recorded, H-8 equipped with an in-car camera system, TFC Husseys and Tpr. Hughes body camera.  Defendant: Porter, Diamond Alexis  Date of Birth: 08/30/1999  Location: Northbound Route 301, south of Holly Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601  Drivers License #: MD MD10272395696  DUI #: 23-036  .01 BrAC  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police.  NARRATIVE/ VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):  On 02/26/2023 at approximately 1822 hours, I, Tpr. Hughes #7578 and TFC Hussey #6913 (FTT) with the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack were on patrol, northbound Route 301, south of Holly Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601 in MSP unmarked unit H-8. At that time, I observed the operator of a black Kia Seltos bearing a Maryland Registration (5DC6914) with her cellphone in her right hand and her thumb operating the cellphone. I then initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle using my emergency equipment. The vehicle stopped in the right turn lane, northbound Route 301, south of Holly Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  I asked the driver for her drivers license and registration card, which she displayed a picture of her drivers license. I identified the driver by the picture of her Maryland Drivers License as Porter, Diamond Alexis, B/F, DOB: 08/30/1999. I observed Porter had bloodshot and glassy eyes while speaking with her. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Porters person. I observed an open bottle of Mikes Hard Lemonade in the front passengers seat door pocket. Porter advised that she was on her way to pick up her dog and then going back home. I asked Porter if she had any alcoholic beverages tonight and she said no. As Porter exited her vehicle, I continued to smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her person.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  I requested Porter to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which she agreed to take. I asked Porter if she wears contacts or glasses and she advised no. I asked Porter if she has had any recent head injuries, like a concussion and she advised no. I then asked Porter if she had any prior medical history and she said no. TFC Hussey #6913 asked Porter if she had been smoking Cannabis and she replied, maybe a little.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST: (4/6 clues observed).  Porter displayed equal pupil size, equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus in both eyes.  Porter did not display a lack of smooth pursuit in either eye.  Porter displayed Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  Porter displayed Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  VERTICAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS:  Porter did not display vertical Nystagmus in either eye.  WALK AND TURN: (4/8 clues observed). Shoes not worn for test.  I properly explained and demonstrated the test to Porter and how the test should be performed. Porter was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. Porter was instructed, and I demonstrated, how to place her hands flat at her side and remain in that position until told to begin. Porter was instructed to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching heel to toe. Porter was told to keep her hands flat at her side, to keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step out loud.  On the ninth step, Porter was instructed, and I demonstrated, how to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn 180 degrees. Porter was again instructed, and I demonstrated, the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Porter was instructed that once she began the test, she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, to keep her hands down at her side, to count each step out loud, and to keep her eyes focused on her feet.  Instructional stage:  Nothing to report.  Walking Stage:    Missed heel-to-toe: Porter missed heel to toe on steps 4 and 7 on the first series of nine (9) steps. Porter missed heel to toe on steps 3, 6, 7, and 9 on the second series of nine (9) steps.   Stepped off line: Porter stepped off the line on step 4 on the first series of nine (9) steps.  Raised arms: Porter raised her arms on steps 5, 6, and 7 on the first series of nine (9) steps.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Turn: Porter lifted her lead foot off of the ground during the turn.   ONE LEG STAND: (3/4 clues observed). Right foot lifted. Shoes not worn for the test.  Prior to Porter performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Porter was instructed to raise either foot approximately six inches off the ground, arms against her side, pointing her foot, looking down at her foot, and to count out loud one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three and to continue to count until I tell her to stop.  0 to 10 seconds:    Porter raised her arms at count 3 and continued to keep them raised for this portion of the test.  Porter swayed at count 1, and 10.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Porter hopped at count 4, 8, and 9.   11 to 20 seconds:    Porter raised her arms at count 11 and continued to keep them raised for this portion of the test.   Porter swayed at count 11 and continued to sway for this portion of the test.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Porter hopped at count 11 and continued to hop for this portion of the test.   21 to 30 seconds:    Porter raised her arms at count 24, 26, and 30.   Porter swayed at count 23, and 28 through 30.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Porter hopped at count 28 and continued to hop for the remainder of the test.   Porter was offered a preliminary breath test, which she refused to take.
