         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM* MVR Statement: The following incident was captured on in-car camera. Title: LIGHTY R 23-360. ID: 23-MSP-023676 Arrested: Lighty, Desmond James. Certification and training  -Trained in Field Sobriety Test through Maryland State Police Academy.  -Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E)  -Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  - Graduated from The Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies Driving Under the Influence Institute-University of Maryland.  - I have apprehended more than 240 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On July 01, 2023, at approximately 2300 hours, I, TFC. I. Riba Tankari # 7058 with Maryland State Police was traveling outer loop I-695 west of Charles, Baltimore County, Maryland in lane #3 (right middle lane). My issued patrol vehicle is Maryland State Police marked unit DUI-3. At that time, I observed a silver Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration 8EZ6335 traveling outer loop I 695 in lane #3 unable to stay within a single lane. I observed the Honda had swerved from lane #3 into lane #4 (right lane) by one tire width on two separate occasions before changing lane into lane #2 (left middle lane). I followed the Honda and observed the vehicle had swerved from lane #2 into lane #3 by more than one tire width on one occasion. I observed the Honda had swerved to the left then to the right towards the dotted white line on several occasions and drove on the dotted line. I continued to follow the Honda and again observed the vehicle had swerved from lane #2 into lane #3 by one tire width on two separate occasions. I initiated a traffic stop on the Honda using my emergency equipment. The Honda came to a stop in the area of outer loop I-695 and Greenspring Avenue, Pikesville, Maryland on the left shoulder. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the Honda on the driver side and made contact with the driver (the sole occupant) of the vehicle. I introduced myself and explained to him the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver where he was coming from, and he stated my girlfriends house. I asked him where he was heading, and he stated Towson. I requested his drivers license and registration card. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I observed that the driver had watery and glassy eyes. I observed the drivers movements were slow while retrieving the requested documents. The driver was identified through his Maryland commercial drivers license as Lighty, Desmond James. I returned to my patrol vehicle and notified the barrack who I was out with. I returned to the Honda and requested Lighty to exit his vehicle and to walk to the front of his vehicle and he complied. While outside his vehicle, I again noticed his movements were slow. I asked Lighty how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed and Lighty was talkative and was trying to avoid the question, but he later stated he had two shots of Tequila and one mixed drink. While speaking with Lighty outside his vehicle, I again detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I asked Lighty to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, and he agreed. The evaluation surface was dry, flat, and free of debris. No surface defects were observed. My patrol flashlight, his vehicle headlights, and overhead lamps lit the area. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Lighty appeared to be in good physical conditions. I asked Lighty the following questions: Medical conditions: No. Medications: No. Anything that will prevent you from walking on straight line or standing on one leg: No Glasses or contact: No. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: (6/6 clues observed). The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus - Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Notes: * During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Lightys breath. WALK AND TURN: (7/8 clues observed). The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Lighty stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage: Lighty lost his balance to the right on several occasions then to the left on three separate occasions and had difficulty staying in instructional position. Lighty started too soon on two separate occasions. Walking Stage (1st Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than half inch on counts 3, 5, and 7. Stepped completely offline by one shoe width on count 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Raised his arms more than six (6) inches away from his body for balance on all counts. Notes *Lighty restarted the first series of nine after failing to remember the instructions. *Did not start from the instructional position on the second attempt. *difficulty remembering instruction. After the nine steps, Lighty stood and looked at me, I then asked him what is next, and he stated you got me, you got me. Turn: The turn was not completed correctly; instead Lighty turned to his right failing to take a series of small steps as instructed and demonstrated. Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than half inch on counts 1, 6, and 8. Raised his arms more than six (6) inches away from his body for balance on all counts. Stepped completely offline by one shoe width on count 2 and 4. Stopped walking on counts 2. One Leg Stand Test (3/4 observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Lighty stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.

Notes *can I call my girlfriend to pick me up? Preliminary Breath Test:  I explained and offered a PBT to Lighty. Lighty refused to consent to the PBT. ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Lighty was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely:  -Unable to stay within a single lane/driving patterns.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from vehicle.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath as he conversed with me.  -Eyes watery and glassy.  - Movements slow.  -His admissions to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving.  -Observed signs of impairment as he performed the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  Lighty was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a motor vehicle at 2326 hours and was transported to the Baltimore County Police Department Towson Precinct. A search incident to arrest revealed no weapons or contraband. Upon arrival to the Precinct, Lighty was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, and it was read to him from the MVA website in English, and he refused to consent to the Intoximeter EC/IR II test on July 02, 2023, at 0310 hours. A properly functioning instrument and operator were available.  Lighty was given pertinent paperwork, released from the Precinct to his mother pending an appearance in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County at a later date.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
