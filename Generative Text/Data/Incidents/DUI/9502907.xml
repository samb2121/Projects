         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> Patrol Vehicle S-22 is equipped with an in-car camera/recorder and body cam  Weather:Clear/60 degrees  Defendant: Brengle, Erin, Michelle Date of Birth: 5/20/1989 Date of Arrest: 4/3/23 Time of Arrest: 1450                                                       License#: Md B652234603381 DUI #S-23-039 Centreville  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  Vehicle was parked at the Valero gas pumps at 201 Romancoke Rd., Stevensville, Md 21666. Valero staff reported subject had been parked at the pump for over an hour. Valero staff advised she couldnt find her vehicle. They advised she appeared :high and they were scared.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  On Monday, Apr 3, 2023 at approximately 1436 hours I responded to the Valero Station at 201 Romancoke Rd., Stevensville, Md 21666 for check the welfare for subject at gas pumps. Upon arrival I made contact with the staff who pointed out the subject to me. They advised she was confused, an had been in and out of the store multiple times. I then made contact with the subject who was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Erin Michelle Brengle, (W/F 5/20/89) who was actively cleaning out of truck, a black 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, bearing Md registration 65V504. During my initial contact I noticed that Brengles pupils were pinpointed, and parts of her speech sounded drifting It would start out intelligible, then drift off into a mumble. Brengle seemed to be surprised when confronted with her being at the pumps for over 45 min. It initially appeared that Brengle was trying to avoid eye contact, and avoid conversation by continuing to walk around her truck. When confronted if she was on anything Brengle continued to seem preoccupied. Brengles speech appeared confused answering what had caused the damage to the front of her pickup. She appeared to sway when answering. Brengle agreed to SFSTs without hesitation.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed in the parking lot in front of her pickup. The surface was dry, level and free of any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of the natural sunlighting at approximately 1440 hours. Brengle was wearing house shoes type footwear and appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 clues observed)  HGN was conducted using my index finger as a stimulus. The stimulus was passed horizontally at a distance of 12-15 inches and slightly above eye level across Brengles face. During the instructions I made it clear to Brengle to keep her head still and to only follow the stimulus with her eyes. I then checked for equal tracking and equal pupil size (appeared pinpointed). During the test, Brengle did not demonstrated a lack of smooth pursuit. She demonstrated distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximumdeviation and nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.  WALK AND TURN (2/8 clues observed)  Prior to Brengle performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I placed Brengle into the instructional position. However, she tried to change the lead foot, but was re instructed on proper placement. I had Brengle to place her right foot in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. I demonstrated and instructed Brengle to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Brengle was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Brengle was to keep her hands flat to her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step, I demonstrated and explained to Brengle to keep her lead foot on the line, and make a series of small steps around her lead foot with her rear foot to turn completely around and begin the second series of nine steps.I again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be identical to the first series. Brengle was instructed that once she began the test she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her side, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Brengle if she understood the test and she indicated she did. During Brengles initial 9 steps she failed to touch heel to toe on steps 2 and 3 and stepped offline on step 2. Brengle completed the turn satisfactorily.Brengle then completed second set of nine by missing heel to toe on step 2.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Had to be instructed twice to put right foot in front of left.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on steps 2, and 3 2.) Stepped offline on step 2  Turn:  Walking Stage (2nd Nine) 1.) Satisfactory  ONE LEG STAND (OLS) (1/4 clues)  Prior to Brengle performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Brengle was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised she was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Brengle was asked if she understood the test and the instructions which she indicated she did. Brengle then lifted her right foot.  Instructional Stage:   Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10:  Seconds 10-20:  1.) Swayed  Seconds 20-30:  1.) Brengle was stopped at 30 seconds (real time) at her count of 22.   PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) Brengle was not offered PBT  ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Brengle was driving a motor vehicle while impaired.  * Physical mannerisms * Pinpointed pupils * Performance on SFSTs   Brengle was placed under arrest for Driving While Impaired at 1450 hours. Brengle was then placed into the patrol car and transported to MSP-Easton for intoximeter testing. Brengle agreed to intoximeter, but refused DRE and Blood Kit. (Brengle made statement during transport of using Methadone)  Witness statements, and Surveillance video to be added with supplement.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: .00  All events occurred in Queen Anne and Talbot Counties</NarrativeText>
