         <NarrativeText>MSP unmarked vehicle Q-21 is equipped with a mobile recording device and a BWC   Defendant: Mary Christine Bakel  Date of Birth: 12/23/1976  Date of Arrest: 9/10/2023  Time of Arrest: 2227 hours  DUI #: 23-490  ****REPEAT OFFENDER***  Witness: Cpl Clagett (off-duty) 443-277-9268  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING * Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Expert Witness * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Standardized Field Sobriety Test Instructor * Completed the Advanced Roadside Impairment Driving Enforcement Program. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police.  (PHASE 1) On Sunday, September 10, 2023 at approximately 2051 hours, I, Corporal Dunlap of the Maryland State Police was on routine patrol in my unmarked MSP vehicle Q-21. At this time, I received a call of a single vehicle crash in the area of I-795 northbound prior to Franklin Blvd. I arrived moments later and observed a black 2016 Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration A347845 in lane 1. It was apparent from tire tracks that the vehicle was in lane 1 went it lost control, veered to the left off road, and struck the metal guardrail. It was raining and the road was wet. The final resting location was back in lane 1 of I-795. The vehicle was not struck again while it was in the travel portion of the highway. The vehicle suffered severe front-end damage. The Honda was only occupied by a woman and a dog. The Honda driver was seated with her dog in the rear of Baltimore County Police Department Officer Burrills (#6468) vehicle. Bakel was seated in the county police vehicle to stay dry as her vehicle suffered great damage. It was raining. She was not under arrest. Officer Burrill advised me that she observed a bottle of alcohol in the Honda and she detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on the driver. An off-duty Westminster police officer, Corporal Clagett, was on scene along with his wife. Corporal Clagett advised he observed the woman later identified as, Mary Christine Bakel, in the vehicle and trying to drive away. Corporal Clagett stated her heard the engine revving during her attempt.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the police vehicle and spoke with the Honda driver. She was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Mary Christine Bakel. I detected the extremely strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Bakel. She had glassy, bloodshot eyes. I advised the driver of my: rank, name, ID number, agency and that the stop was being audibly/visually recorded. Her movements were slow and lethargic. I asked her how the crash occurred. I really got just got, like it just took me to a turn.it wasnt a bad thing, it wasnt like a real thing. When I inquired about her alcohol consumption. She replied a little bit earliertwo beers. When I where she said at my friends houseabout an hour ago.  There was an empty 200 ml bottle of Smirnoff vodka in the Honda. Bakel was detained and taken to the Golden Ring barrack for field sobriety tests. Her purse with her phone also included a personal amount bag of marijuana. Her marijuana was not seized. Bakel advised that as she was driving the dog got between her and the steering wheel and she lost control of the vehicle. As Bakel spoke, I continued to smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. Bakel had emotional swings during transport and cursed at me on multiple occasions.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed in the hallway at the barrack. The floor surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions were excellent. Bakel appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Bakel the following questions: Injuries  No Medication  No Medical Conditions  No Glasses  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pointer finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Bakels eyes. She was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes until told to stop. Bakels pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed. She was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Bakel if she understood the instructions and she stated yes.   1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes Vertical Nystagmus: Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (8/8 clues observed) Prior to Bakel performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Bakel was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. Bakel was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Bakel was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Bakel was to keep her hands flat at her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Bakel was explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around. Bakel was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Bakel was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her side, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Bakel if she understood the instructions and she stated yes. She opted to keep her boots on.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Started too soon. Bakel began walking while I was giving instructions.   2.) Bakel was feet broke apart and she stood with her feet next to each other.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Took 12 steps instead of the instructed 9 steps.  2.) Missed heel to toe on steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12.   3.) Stepped off line on steps 2, 7, and 10.   4.) Stopped walking on step 12.   5.) Used arms for balance on step 6. Her arms were more than 6 inches from her sides. Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on all steps.   2.) Took 10 steps instead of the instructed 9 steps.  3.) Hers arm were more than 6 inches away from her sides on steps 3 through 10. Turn:Improper  Bakel stopped for 9 seconds, turned, reset feet, then continued walking.   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) Prior to Jones performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Jones was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised she was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Jones if she understood the instructions and she stated yes. The instructions had to be given twice.  Instructional Stage: .) Nothing to report  Balance and Count Stage:   Seconds 0-10: 1.) Swayed body to the left and right. 2.) Used arms for balance. Bakels arms were more than 6 inches from her sides. 3.) Placed foot down on the ground.   Seconds 11-20: .) Bakel kept her foot down for the majority of this time period  Seconds 21-30: 1.) Swayed body to the left and right. 2.) Placed foot down on the ground.  Bakel submitted to a preliminary breath test with a .26 BrAC result.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Bakel was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Crashing her vehicle. * Empty bottle of Smirnoff * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. * Slow and lethargic head and body movements. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot with a gazed look. * My observed signs of impairment as she performed field sobriety tests.  I arrested Bakel for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2227 hours. At 2242 hours, I played the English audio DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Bakel in its entirety. She was given a paper copy to read along. At the conclusion of the form, Bakel verbally advised that she would submit breath samples for the intoximeter test and signed the form indicating the same.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the observation period on Bakel in its entirety starting with her time of arrest. I escorted Bakel into the arrest processing room and remained in her custody until the time of test. Bakels mouth was checked and no foreign objects or piercings were observed.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: The intoximeter test was administered within the two-hour statutory time frame. This test was administered by a certified breath technician on equipment approved by the Chief Toxicologist in the Department of State Police Forensic Science Division.   ***.26 BrAC PER 210 LITERS OF BREATH***  Bakel was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released at 0010 hours. Bakel was disruptive, impolite, and uncooperative throughout the process.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland. Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
