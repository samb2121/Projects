NARRATIVE:   Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:   On June 19, 2023, at approximately 1915 hours, I, TFC Ramsay, was on patrol in the area of Eastern Shore Drive and South Boulevard. At the above date and time, I observed a red Ford Ranger bearing Maryland registration MRCRUZ with both its operator and passenger unrestrained by a seatbelt. The vehicle turned into the ACME parking lot. As I approached the vehicle and activated my emergency equipment to initiate a traffic stop, I once again observed both the operator and the passenger to be unrestrained.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact:    I exited my vehicle and contacted the operator, Antonio Cruz Enriquez (H/M 06/13/1976), identified myself, advised the reason for the traffic stop, and that he was being audibly and visually recorded. While speaking with him, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. I had to ask Cruz Enriquez multiple times to provide me with his license. His eyes were watery and glassy. When asked how much alcohol he had consumed, Cruz Enriquez stated, a little bitone beer, a couple beers.  Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening: I asked Cruz Enriquez if he wanted to perform standardized field sobriety tests. Cruz Enriquez advised he wished to do the tests. While speaking with him outside the vehicle, there was an odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Cruz Enriquezs breath and person. I once again asked Cruz Enriquez how much alcohol he consumed and this time he stated, two beers. *It should be noted SFSTs were completed using Google Translate due to a language barrier Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus:    I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Cruz Enriquez. After explaining the test, I asked him if he understood the test and if he had any questions. Cruz Enriquez stated he understood the test and I began.  Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes *Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes *Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes   The test was not fully completed due to Cruz Enriquez inability to keep his head still and follow directions properly    Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues: 4 of 6  Walk and Turn: Weather: Clear Surface: Level asphalt free of any debris    I instructed Cruz Enriquez into the instructional phase. I then explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn test to Cruz Enriquez. I asked Cruz Enriquez if he understood the test, and he stated that he understood. Cruz Enriquez began the test.   Instructional Phase: Broke balance  Walking stage 1st 9: Missed heel to toe Used arms for balance Stopped walking  Turn:  Incorrect  Walking stage 2nd 9: Used arms for balance Incorrect number of steps: 10  Total Walk and Turn Clues:6 of 8  One Leg Stand: I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Cruz Enriquez. I asked Cruz Enriquez if he understood the test, and he stated he did. Clues: Swayed Hopped Used arms for balance Put foot down   Total One Leg Stand Clues:4 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test   I explained to Cruz Enriquez the reasons for using a preliminary breath test and asked if he wanted to submit a breath sample. Cruz Enriquez advised me that she wanted to submit a breath sample. Cruz Enriquez submitted a breath sample of .08 BrAC. Arrest and Transport:    Based on the following, I had reason to believe Cruz Enriquez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol  * The odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle and his breath and person * My observed signs of impairment * Glassy and watery eyes * Admittance to having consumed alcohol   I placed Cruz Enriquez under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 1929 hours. On the way to the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack, the odor of an alcoholic beverage was present in my patrol car that was not there prior to the traffic stop.  20 Minute Observation Period:   Cruz Enriquez listened to his DR 15 advice of rights via Spanish audio on the way back to the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack. Cruz Enriquez agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 at 1948 hours. Cpl. Smith of the Maryland State Police, who is a certified intoximeter operator, administered the test at 2006 hours. Cruz Enriquezs breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .07 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Cruz Enriquez was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was released.   I request this case closed. </NarrativeText>
