         <NarrativeText>Patrol Vehicle Information- Q-11 (Marked) is equipped with a mobile recording device. The stop was recorded on in-car camera as well as body-worn camera.  Defendant: Prince P Thurston/Date of Birth: 05/28/1979  Date of Arrest: 09/04/2023  Time of Arrest: 1929 hours  Officers Training/Experience  *Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police Academy   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On September 4, 2023 at approximately 1905 hours, I Trooper Albaugh #7339, was responded to N/B I95 at Konterra Drive, Calverton, Prince Georges County, Maryland to assist Corporal McCloskey #6175 with a possible intoxicated driver. Upon arrival I spoke with Corporal McCloskey who advised the reason for the stop was that the vehicle, observed to be a Silver, BMW X5, displaying Maryland registration 1CE3119, came off of the exit ramp at a high rate of speed almost causing a collision. Corporal McCloskey then observed the vehicle swerving from lane 1 into lane 2, then onto the shoulder almost off the road a couple of times. Corporal McCloskey activated his emergency equipment and the driver abruptly stopped in the middle of the roadway almost causing another collision. When Corporal McCloskey made contact with the driver, Corporal McCloskey observed the driver to be leaning back in the car, having very slurred speech and his eyes glazed over. Corporal McCloskey asked the driver where he was coming from to which the driver replied, a haircut. Corporal McCloskey advised he could not really smell anything on him, because the driver had a strong scent of perfume or something to that effect on him.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I made a drivers side approach on the vehicle and contacted the sole operator later identified by his Maryland drivers license as Prince P Thurston (B/M, DOB: 05/28/1979). I observed Thurstons speech to be slurred and to have glassy eyes. I detected a faint odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Thurstons breath and person. I then asked Thurston to step out of the vehicle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. While walking from his vehicle to my patrol vehicle I observed Thurston to be unsteady in his movements and struggle to maintain his balance.  It should be noted that Tfc. Stine, Trooper Houck and Trooper Nikodemski were also on scene during my interaction with Thurston.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)    The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of northbound Interstate 95 at Konterra Drive which was level and free of debris. The weather was clear during the test. Lighting conditions consisted of daylight. Thurston appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. Thurston was wearing flat soled tennis shoes.  I asked Thurston if he had any medical conditions or injuries and he indicated no.    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. The tip of my ink pen was used as the tests stimulus and was held approximately 12-15 inches from Thurstons eyes. Thurston was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only. Thurston was positioned in a manner to ensure the passing of traffic would not interfere with the test results. Thurstons pupils were equal in size and displayed equal tracking. Thurstons eyes were glassy.   My observations during the test:      Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes      Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes      Vertical Nystagmus- Not present      WALK AND TURN TEST (8/8 clues observed)    The second test given was the Walk and Turn Test. Prior to performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Thurston was instructed to place his right foot in front of his left foot with his heel touching the toe. Thurston was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands at his side and to remain in that position until told to begin the test. Thurston was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Thurston was advised to keep his hands at his side and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step, Thurston was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot planted on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Thurston was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Thurston was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed. I asked if he understood the test, and he stated, Sure.       Balance- Thurston struggled to remain in the instructional phase and moved his feet from the desired position. After the failed attempt in putting heel to toe for the instructional stage, Thurston decided to put feet together instead of placing it back into the instructed position.      Starts too soon- Thurston started the test after being advised not to begin the test on three separate occasions.      Stops walking- After the 13th step Thurston turned around and asked 9?      Misses heel to toe- Step 1 and 2      Steps off-line- Step 3      Raises arms- Thurston raised his arms on his return on the 10th step.      Actual number of steps- Thurston on his first 9 steps took 13 steps, and on his return of 9 steps took 10.      Improper Turn- Thurston spun around and did not take a series of small steps to complete the turn.      ONE LEG STAND (4/4 clues observed)  The last test given was the One Leg Stand Test. Prior to performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Thurston was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his side while the instructions were given. When instructed to begin, he was explained to raise the foot of his choice approximately six (6) inches off the ground. While his foot was raised, he was to keep his standing leg straight and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two). Thurston was advised to continue with the test until told to stop. Thurston was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Im ok.  Balance and Count Stage: Balanced on left foot, raising his right foot.       Sways- 0-10, 11-20      Raises Arms- 0-10, 11-20      Hopps- 0-10, 11-20      Puts foot down- 11-20, 21-30      PBT WAS OFFERED AND REFUSED   ARREST  Based on the following observations, I had reason to believe Thurston was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  -Slurred speech  -Eyes glassy  -Faint odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person.  -Observed the driver struggling to maintain balance walking to the back of the patrol vehicle.  -Observed signs of impairment during the performed Standardized Field Sobriety Tests   Prince P Thurston was placed under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol at approximately 1929 hours. Thurston was transported to the College Park Barrack for processing. At approximately 1934 hours, the DR-15, Advice Of Rights was audibly played from the Motor Vehicle Administration website while driving back to the barrack. While driving back to the barrack, Thurston dozed off multiple times. Once at the College Park Barrack, the DR-15 Advice of Rights was read aloud again by myself. A copy was provided to Thurston to be able to read along with me at the time. Thurston refused to sign the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Thurston refused to take the Intoximeter/Chemical test. Thurston was issued the appropriate documents and citations and was released from the College Park Barrack at approximately 2140 hours to his wife.  Prince P Thurston was charged with the following through the Maryland Transportation Article:    (1.) 21-902(a)(1)(i) Driving Vehicle While Under The Influence of Alcohol.  (2.) 21-902(b)(1)(i) Driving While Impaired by Alcohol.  (3.) 21-901.1(b) Negligent Driving Vehicle in Careless and Imprudent Manner Endangering Property, Life and Person.  (5.) 21-901.1(a) Reckless Driving.  (6.) 21-309 (b) Driver changing lanes when unsafe  (7.) 21-201(a)(1) Driver failure to obey properly placed traffic control device instructions.   All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. Case CLOSED with adult arrest.    </NarrativeText>
