         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-278 R LEWIS ID: 23-MSP-017961 Defendant: Zachary James Robert Lewis TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On May 20, 2023 at approximately 0340 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on the Inner Loop of I-695 in the area of York Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a white Infiniti Q60 failing to drive within a single lane and traveling above the posted speed limit. The Infiniti was bearing Maryland registration 5EZ3673.    Left over dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Changed into lane one.  Left over solid yellow fog line with the driver side tires.  Changed into lane two.  Right over dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.  Changed into lane three.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Drove on solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Right over dotted white lane line with the passenger side tires.  Left over dotted white lane line with approximately half the Infinitis width and straddled the lane line. The Infiniti straddled the lane line for approximately 300 yards.  Observed speed at 94-MPH in a 55-MPH posted speed zone.  Changed two consecutive lanes, lane three to lane one.  Right over dotted white lane line with approximately half the Infinitis width and straddled the lane line. The Infiniti straddled the lane line for approximately 150 yards.  Changed two consecutive lanes, lane one to lane three.  Left over dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  The Infiniti accelerated away from my patrol vehicle at what appeared to be above the posted 55 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar, which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 94 MPH in a posted 55 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Inner Loop of I-695 at Perring Parkway.  The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Infiniti on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the sole occupant. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. The driver stated he has his vehicles registration. I asked him if he had his license and he responded, No. I then asked if he had a license and he stated, Im in the midst of recuperating my shit. I again asked if he had the vehicles registration. The driver now reached over to the passenger side glovebox and retrieved a document from Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). The document from MDOT was regarding his current license status, which is Identification Card only. The driver again stated he had his registration card and I asked him to produce the card. I furthered by asking the driver if he was the registered owner of the vehicle, which he confirmed that he was. I informed the driver that once he provided me the registration card, I would have the information I needed. The driver again reached to the passenger side glovebox but did not retrieve any documents. He turned to me and asked, What do you need? I informed him again, I needed his vehicles registration card.  The driver then grabbed the vehicles gear shift and placed the vehicle in drive. The driver fled the scene of the traffic. While speaking with the driver of the Infiniti, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. The drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. The driver also displayed slow, slurred speech and slow, lethargic movements.  Upon the Infiniti and driver fleeing the scene of the traffic stop, I notified the barrack and did not pursue the vehicle. I returned to my patrol vehicle and conducted a METERS/NCIC/MVA browse of the Infinitis registration. The result revealed the owner of the Infiniti to be Zachary James Robert Lewis. I conducted another METERS/NCIC/MVA browse of the Maryland Soundex number of the registered owner (L-200-974-367-151). The search revealed that Lewis does not have a drivers license and only has a state identification card. The search of Lewis Soundex number also revealed a Motor Vehicle Administration photo, which confirmed the identity of the driver being Zachary James Robert Lewis.   After confirming the identity of Lewis as the driver of the Infiniti, I went to the address on file with the Motor Vehicle Administration. I arrived at the address and began to conduct a search for the Infiniti. The Infiniti was located in the parking lot of the housing complex and the registration plate of the Infiniti was confirmed to the vehicle that fled the traffic stop. Due to Lewis fleeing the scene of the traffic stop, there was no standardized field sobriety tests performed.   I request this case remains open pending charges.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
