         <NarrativeText>DWI # 23-003  R-43 is equipped with a mobile video recording device and I had my Axon body camera recording throughout the incident. This incident was both audibly and visually recorded.   Defendant:Toni Chevvone Rainford  Date of Birth:11/22/1990  Date of Arrest:01/01/2023  Time of Arrest: 0510 hours  MD DL: MD-10272562462  Training Certifications: -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police. -NHSTA certified to conduct field sobriety test (SFST). -Preliminary breath test operator certified.  Narrative:  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On January 1st, 2023 at 0447 hours, I, Trooper Lowery #7448 was on routine patrol operating marked Maryland State Police vehicle R-43. I was dispatched to a multiple vehicle collision at 695 Outer Loop at exit 15, to provide traffic control. As I made my way to the collision, I saw two parked vehicles in lane 2 at 695 Outer Loop prior to Security Blvd.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  I approached the black Hyundai Accent MD: 2CN3431, and saw the driver was unconscious. I knocked on the window and spoke with the driver, Toni Rainford (DOB 11/22/1990), later identified by her MD drivers license. Rainford lowered her drivers side window. I smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I also noticed an open container of an Angry Orchard beer, which contained 5% alcohol, in the center console I asked Rainford to step out of the vehicle and sit on the left shoulder by the concrete barrier.   Rainford stated What is happening? I stated to Rainford you were passed out behind the wheel. Immediately Rainford replied with I wasnt passed out. As Rainford was speaking I smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her person. I asked Rainford how much alcohol she had consumed tonight. Rainford stated You can call to see how much alcohol I had. As I was speaking to Rainford, she became verbally hostile yelling at me. I asked Rainford for her drivers license, and Rainford replied with I have nothing to say. Rainford then stopped answering questions I told Rainford I needed to know if it was her vehicle because I would have to tow the vehicle. Rainford then yelled out Its my car sir! I then had medical personnel respond to the scene. Rainford denied any medical attention. I then asked Rainford to retrieve her drivers license from her vehicle. Rainford handed me her Maryland drivers license after entering her vehicle. I also had Rainford take the keys out of her ignition, so she would not drive away from the scene.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  Before administering the SFST, I asked Rainfordthe following preliminary questions:   Medical Conditions- None.  How much alcohol did you consume?- One glass of wine.  Injuries- None.  Medication Use- None.  Diabetic- No.  Highest level of education- Bachelors degree from college.  As I asked Rainford the questions, I could detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her person.  Rainford advised she was coming from her friends residence in Owings Mills, Maryland.  As I approached Rainfords vehicle with a Baltimore County police officer, Rainford was on the phone asking to be picked up. I asked Rainford to step out of the vehicle so I could speak to her. Rainford stated Why Am I stepping out? I stated to Rainford to perform SFSTS. Rainford stated No Im going to have my friend pick me up. I told Rainford she is being detained for suspicion of DUI/DWI. Rainford then stated No. I then asked Rainford if she was refusing to do SFSTS, and Rainford did not reply. Rainford stated that we were not giving the same treatment to the other driver of the vehicle that was parked behind her. Rainford stated she did not trust me. I advised Rainford that I am a State Trooper with a body camera on. Rainford then replied That means nothing, you guys shoot people all the time. Rainford then stated I do not trust you.   ARREST:  Due to Rainford being unconscious in a parked vehicle on 695 Outer Loop prior to Security Blvd in lane 2, an open container of Angry Orchard beer in the center console, the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her person, admission to drinking alcohol prior to driving, and her behavior being consistent with someone who is under the influence of alcohol. I stated to Rainford, she was under arrest for DUI/DWI. Rainford then stepped out of the vehicle with her phone in her right hand. I stated to Rainford to place her hands behind her back, and that she was under arrest. Rainford stated No Im not, and let me call my mother. I had to verbally de-escalate by stating to Rainford to place her hands behind her back multiple times. Rainford then called her mother and stated He is trying to arrest me. I then grabbed Rainfords right arm and left arm placed it behind her back to place her into custody.   On January 1st, 2022 at 0510 hours, I Trooper Lowery #7448, arrested Rainford for DUI/DWI. Rainford then yelled out My hands are behind my back and theyre trying to kill me. Rainford yelled out several more times Theyre trying to kill me. Rainford then started crying when I brought her to my front passenger side seat. Rainford sat in the front passenger seat facing towards me. I asked Rainford to sit all the way back so I could place her seat belt on. Rainford then screamed out Can you call my mother? I advised Rainford when she got to the Golden Ring barrack she would be able to make a phone call. Rainford then stated You said Im under arrest because Im black and because you dont like me. I then went to place Rainfords legs inside the vehicle, since she would not comply. Rainford stated Dont fucking touch me. Rainford then placed both her legs inside the vehicle facing forward.   During transport to Golden Ring, I smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Rainfords person. Rainford started crying during transport and stated People be driving crazy all the time. Rainford stated she put her vehicle in park due to traffic. Rainford stated I was being condescending.  Upon arrival at the Golden Ring barrack I asked Rainford to walk towards the door to enter the building. Rainford stated You dont want to hold my hand? And you still dont want to be friends. Rainford kept stating she wanted to be friends and she would reach out to me.  On January 1st, 2023 at approximately 0545 hours the DR Advice of Rights was read to Rainford in English.   On January 1st, 2023 at 0556 hours, Rainford signed the DR 15 Advice of Rights, stating she would submit to an alcohol concentration test.   On January 1st, 2023 at 0705 hours Rainford produced a breath specimen to contain an alcohol concentration of .04 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  Rainford was issued the appropriate citations for driving under the influence of alcohol.  Rainford had a sober friend pick her up and transport her from the barrack, back to her residence.  I request this case to be closed by arrest.  All above events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland </NarrativeText>
