As I positioned my vehicle behind the Ford Fusion, it immediately changed from lane #4 to lane #3. The Ford Fusion had a drivers side tail light inoperative. A METERS/NCIC check revealed the license plate that was displayed on the Ford Fusion were registered to another vehicle. At this time I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle pulled over onto the right-hand shoulder.

Henry Jrs eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I asked Henry Jr where he was coming from, and he advised he was coming from the Washington Commanders football game. Henry Jr advised he consumed alcoholic beverages prior to the game. At this time I requested another unit for Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Once the second unit arrived I asked Henry Jr to exit the vehicle to perform SFSTs to which he agreed.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3): The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of the highway. The weather was clear and approximately 60 degrees. Lighting conditions were dark. The ground was level and free of any debris. My patrol vehicles overhead emergency lights in the front were deactivated prior to field sobriety tests as well as the vehicles spotlight.
