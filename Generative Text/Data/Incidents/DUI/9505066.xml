         <NarrativeText>Marked Unit W-31 is equipped with a camera. Axon Body Camera footage was recorded.  Case # 23-MSP-023687 Defendant: Jeremy Joseph McKenzie Date of Birth: 09/09/1981 Date of Arrest: 07/02/2023 Time of Arrest: 0039 Hours DUI#: 23-047  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING: *I am trained to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside ImpairedDrivingEnforcement (ARIDE) training in May of 2021. *I am trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.   Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion  On Sunday, July 2nd, 2023 at approximately 0028 hours, I, TFC Kline (#7112), currently assigned to the Maryland State Police McHenry Barrack was on patrol, operating marked patrol vehicle W-31, in the area of northbound Garrett Highway (MD 219) and Mosser Road, McHenry, Garrett County, Maryland 21541. At that time, I followed behind a black Ford Explorer for approximately 5 minutes while traveling north on MD 219. While traveling behind the black Ford Explorer, I observed that vehicle failed to maintain its lane while traveling in lane 1 on at least 2 occasions. The vehicle traveled onto the right shoulder crossing the white marker line by at more than a tires width. The black Ford Explorer was also observed braking multiple times, as well as drifting back and forth its lane, touching the double yellow line and while marker line.No other vehicles and/or traffic flow caused the black Ford Explorer to travel in that manner. I activated my emergency equipment to initiate a traffic stop on the black Ford Explorer, which the vehicle came to a complete stop on the right shoulder of the roadway, in the area of MD 219 and Keller Road, Accident, Maryland 21520. I then advised the McHenry Barrack of the traffic stop via radio, and identified the suspects vehicle as a black Ford Explorer displaying a Maryland registration 9ED9426 and noted that it was occupied two times. I then made contact with the operator and front seat passenger via the drivers side window.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact  Upon initial contact with the operator, I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle while speaking with the operator. I introduced myself and the reason for the traffic stop, noting he was swerving while traveling on MD 219. I asked the male operator how his night was going, which he said it was going. I asked him if they did anything fun tonight, which the female passenger advised they are from Mount Savage, Maryland, and they came to the lake tonight to get away for a while. The male operators eyes were observed bloodshot and glassy at that time. His movements were observed slow and lethargic while observing him reach for his vehicles registration. I then identified the male operator by his Maryland drivers license as Jeremy Joseph McKenzie (W/M, DOB: 09/09/1981). I then asked McKenzie how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed tonight, which he advised he probably had 3-4 beers.I then requested for McKenzie to exit his vehicle for voluntary standardized field sobriety tests, which he consented to take. While speaking with McKenzie in front of his vehicle, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage not only emanating from his person, but also from his breath. I again observed McKenzies eyes bloodshot and glassy at that time. McKenzies movements were again observed slow and lethargic and his voice had slurred at times as he spoke. I asked McKenzie again roadside how much alcohol he had consumed, which he then advised he had 4-5 beers. McKenzie advised him and his girlfriend came to the lake this evening to have a good time and to get away from the kids.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening  The tests were conducted on the right shoulder of the roadway, in the area of MD 219 and Keller Road. The surface was dry, level,and free from obvious debris. McKenzie displayed no visible injuries. The front facing emergency lights of my patrol vehicle were deactivated during all phases of testing.  I asked McKenzie the following questions:  Daily/Regular Medications - NONE. Glasses - NONE. Contacts - NONE. Injuries - NONE.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST (6/6 clues displayed)  I used my pen as a stimulus and held it approximately 12 to 15 inches from McKenzies eyes. His eyes displayed no resting nystagmus and his pupils were equal in size. His eyes also showed equal tracking. McKenzie was advised to stand with his feet together and his hands down at his sides during the instruction/demonstration and throughout the test. I asked McKenzie if he could see the tip of my stimulus, and he stated that he could. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. McKenzie was instructed to follow the stimulus with his eyes only, keeping his head still. After stating that he understood the instructions, McKenzie attempted the test with the following results:   1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes. 2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 degrees - Present in both eyes.   WALK AND TURN TEST (1/8 clues displayed)  Prior to McKenzie performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test is conducted. McKenzie was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel-to-toe. McKenzie was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in the position until told to begin. McKenzie was instructed to take a series of nine (9) heel-to-toe steps in a straight line. McKenzie was to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, it was explained and demonstrated, to keep his lead foot on the line, to take a series of small steps around, and to completely turn around 180 degrees. It was explained and demonstrated to McKenzie that a second series of nine (9) heel-to-toe steps were to be performed identical to the first series. I instructed McKenzie that once the test begins to continue until instructed to stop. I then reminded McKenzie to place his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and to count each step out loud. I asked McKenzie if he understood the test, he confirmed that he understood.  Instructional Stage -Stepped out the instructional phase due to not able to keep balance while standing with his left foot heel-to-toe with his right foot.  Walking Stage (1st Nine Steps) -Nothing to report.  The Turn -Nothing to report.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine Steps) -Nothing to report.   ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues displayed)  McKenzie was instructed to stand with his feet together and his hands flat to his sides while the test instructions and demonstration were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground in front of him approximately 6 inches, keeping his legs straight and his toes pointed out in front of him parallel to the ground. While his leg was raised, he was to count out loud by thousands (one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three...) and to continue counting until told to stop. After demonstrating the test, McKenzie advised he understood.  McKenzie was asked which foot he was going to use, which he advised he will raise his left foot from the surface.   Balancing and Counting Stage  0-10 Seconds: -Placed foot on ground on one occasion. -Swayed from side to side.  10-20 Seconds: -Placed foot on ground on one occasion.  20-30 Seconds: -Placed foot on the ground on one occasion.   I asked McKenzie if he would submit to a Preliminary Breath Test roadside, which he consented to take. The results are as follows:.18   McKenzie was placed under arrest forDUI/DWI at approximately 0039 hours. I then placed McKenzie in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. At which time I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present prior to placing McKenzie inside my vehicle.   ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe McKenzie wasdrivinga motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  -Glassy, bloodshot eyes. -Slow and lethargic movements. -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. -HGN: 6/6 clues displayed. -Walk and Turn: 1/8 clues displayed. -One Leg Stand: 2/4 clues displayed. -Failed to maintain a single lane. -Admitted to consuming alcoholic beverages prior todriving. (4-5 alcoholic beverages). -Negligent driving. -Preliminary Breath Test: .18   20 Minute Observation Period  McKenzie was transported to the Maryland State Police McHenry Barrack W for further processing. McKenzie was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, so he could follow along as the DR-15 Advice of Rights audio was played out loud in English. The English version audio can be found on cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank"&gt;mva.maryland.gov. McKenzie signed the DR-15 at approximately 0108 hours acknowledging his consent to take the test. Corporal Arnold (#5304), a certified Intoximeter technician in the State of Maryland, conducted the test for McKenzie. McKenzies breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of.19grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. McKenzie was very apologetic of the situation. McKenzie advised again he had consumed 4-5 alcoholic beverages prior to driving. McKenzie was then issued all pertinent documentation regarding the incident. McKenzie was released to a sober family member from the Maryland State Police McHenry Barrack at approximately 0148 hours.  All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.  I request this case to be closed by arrest. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  </NarrativeText>
