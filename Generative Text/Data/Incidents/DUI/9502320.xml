Norfolk 7120 was patrolling the area of Rt. 13 N/B @ Naylor Mill Rd when I observed a small black sedan come off of Naylor Mill Rd onto Rt.13 N/B. I was behind the vehicle when it got onto Rt.13. While I was behind the vehicle I observed it go from the right turn lane of Rt.13 across three lanes of travel into lane number 1. Once the vehicle was in lane number 1 it started to swerve over the yellow shoulder line multiple times in a jerking manner almost as if it wanted to make a left turn then continued straight. I completed a traffic stop on the vehicle based off of the above observations, traffic was very light due to the time of night on a weekend.  Phase Two - Personal Contact:          I met with the driver of the Black Scion TC bearing DE registration 488462 identified asStacey Marie Camacho-Alejandro 04-17-1997. Due to the hyphenated last name I will be referring to the driver by her first name Stacey from this point forward. Stacey was advised for the reason of the stop along with being advised that the stop was being audibly and visually recorded by my BWC. The beginning of the BWC footage was covered by my uniform tie. This was corrected once it was observed. As I asked Stacey for her license and registration I observed her to have blood shot and glassy eyes. Stacey was wearing a neon green wristband on her right wrist that said Caf Italiano on it. Stacey appeared to have slowed and slurred speech accompanied by slow reaction time and poor finger dexterity. I had to remind Stacey of the information that was needed multiple times. I asked Stacey where she was coming from on the night of the stop, she said that she was leaving her front seat passenger house but did not know where he lived. I asked if Stacey had anything to drink tonight to which she advised that she had a mixed liquor drink but was not specific on what it was. I asked Stacey to step out of the car to complete Standard Field Sobriety Testing to which she agreed. Stacey took a longer than normal time to get out of the car and continued to look for documents and talk as if she had forgotten that she had agreed to get out of the vehicle. Stacey was reminded that she needed to step out of the vehicle multiple times before she finally complied peacefully.  Phase Three - Pre-Arrest Screening:  Once Stacey was out of the vehicle I was able to smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her breath and person.Stacey was observed to have trouble walking to the back of her vehicle and staggered from side to side while walking.Stacey also had difficulty standing upright without swaying from side to side. Stacey was asked again if she had anything to drink today she advised that she did again. I asked Stacey where she was coming from again, and she said her passengers house. I asked if she had been out to eat tonight, and she told me no. I pointed to her wristband and asked about how she has that on her wrist then. Stacey became a little nervous at that time as if she forgot that she had the wristband on her wrist, which I know through my training knowledge and experience as a police officer to be a sign of a person to be of drinking age inside an establishment.         At the time of the SFSTs, she was wearing knee-high boots. Stacey was also wearing appropriate clothing for the season. The area where the testing was completed was flat and level and free from debris. The testing area was lit by my patrol vehicles headlights and nearby streetlights.  Before administering the tests, I askedStacey if she had any medical conditions or physical issues that would keep her from completing any of the tests today to which she answered no. Stacey was asked if she wore contact and or glasses. Stacey said that she does wear glasses but does not need them to drive or walk. My front-facing emergency equipment and spotlight were deactivated before beginning the tests.  The first test administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test:  I explained the test toStacey who advised she understood my instructions and did not have any questions.   Displayed lack of smooth pursuit and equal tracking in both eyes.  Displayed the Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  Displayed the Onset of Nystagmus before 45 degrees in both eyes.  A check for Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was conducted with negative results.  A total of (six) clues were observed during this test.  The second test administered was the Walk and walk-and-turn test:  I explained and demonstrated the test toStacey who advised she understood my instructions and did not have any questions.    Started the test before shewas instructed to do so and was reset into the starting position multiple times.  Had to move herfeet from heel to toe contact on multiple occasions in order to maintainbalance. Each time shemoved herfeet shestaggered from side to side each time and struggled to get back into the starting position.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from the body during the walk and turn test.  Stopped walking after the first set of stepsand asked for further instruction.  Completed an improper turn by turning to the right while not using a series of steps.  Missed heel-to-toe on moststeps during the test.  Stepped offline on moststeps during the test.  Took 13steps on the first set of steps instead of the instructed nine steps and 12steps on the second set of steps.  A total of (8) clues were observed during this test.  The third test administered was the One Leg Stand Test:  I explained and demonstrated the test toStacey who advised she understood my instructions and did not have any questions.    Putfoot down repeatedly during the test in an attempt to keep from falling.  Swayedfrom side to side by approximately three inches during the test.  Raised arms approximately 18 to 20 inches from the side of herbody to maintain balance.  Hopped in order to maintain balance during the test.  A total of two (4) clues were observed during this test.   Based on my observations of Staceys driving, physical appearance, and performance of SFST she was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0200 hours on 10-29-2023.         Staceywas seated in my patrol vehicle. When I entered my vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present before.Stacey was transported to the Salisbury Barrack for processing. While at the barrack, she was read and allowed to read her DR-15 advice of rights, I gave her the option of Spanish or English. Stacey chose the English version. After completing the DR-15,Stacey refusedto submit to the intoximeter at 0226 hours on 10-29-2023.Staceywas provided with all copies of the paperwork and released from the Salisbury Barrack.  Based on all the above facts, I request that the case be closed by arrest. CASE CLOSED.  All events occurred in Wicomico County, MD.  </NarrativeText>
