         <NarrativeText>MARYLAND STATE POLICE BEL AIR BARRACK D HARFORD COUNTY, MARYLAND This incident was recorded. Marked Unit D-10s in-car camera and Tpr. Rowes body worn camera were working properly.  OFFENDER Case # 23-MSP-016228 Defendant: Corey Evan Golden Date of Birth: 10/29/1991 Date of Arrest: 05/06/2023 Time of Arrest: 2308 hours DUI #: 23-121 DUI Citation #: 18H0XD3  SECOND DUI OFFENSE  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING:  *I am trained to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  *I am trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.  *Ireceived Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement(ARIDE) training through the Maryland State Police in April 2022.  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion  On May 6, 2023, at approximately 2302 hours, I, Trooper Rowe (#7015), currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack, was on routine patrol in the area of northbound Baltimore Pike, Bel Air, Maryland. I observed a silver Jeep turn on its left turn signal as it approached the intersection of South Bond Street, which is a one way road and the intersection has a no left turn sign posted. The silver Jeep then began to slow down and made a left turn, entering the left lane of South Bond Street. I immediately activated my emergency lights and siren, conducting a traffic stop on the vehicle and to notify oncoming traffic of the vehicle driving towards them. The silver Jeep stopped in the left lane and turned its hazard lights on. I blocked the intersection with my patrol car and, using the Public Announcement system, I instructed the silver Jeep twice to back up and move the vehicle to Baltimore Pike, so both vehicles would be facing the correct way and not at risk for a collision. The silver Jeep did not back up, so I moved my patrol vehicle behind the silver Jeep to conduct a proper traffic stop. I identified the vehicle as a silver Jeep SUV bearing Maryland registration 1DW1728.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact  Upon making contact with the driver of the vehicle, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I asked the driver what he was doing and all he replied was Im sorry. I noticed the drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I asked the driver for his license and registration. As he was looking for his documents, I asked him where he was coming from. He advised he was coming from his apartment in Bel Air. I asked him where he was heading to. He advised he was trying to get a drink from 7-11. The 7-11 was directly behind us at this point and the driver would have been in the 7-11 parking lot if he had made a right turn instead of the left turn onto South Bond Street. The driver could not find his registration and handed me his license. I identified the driver as Corey Evan Golden (2/M DOB: 10/29/1991) by his Maryland drivers license. I asked Golden how much alcohol he had that night. Golden stated About two drinks. Two, three drinks.   I then instructed Golden pull into one of the parking lots located off of South Bond Street to not be a hazard to other motorists, to which he complied.I requested Golden to conduct Standardized Field of Sobriety Tests. Golden stated he didnt want to go through any tests. I advised Golden that the tests are just to aid my assessment of his impairment. I advised him that I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage from his breath and/or person, made a wrong turn on a one way street, and admitted to having some alcoholic beverages prior to the traffic stop. I again asked Golden if he would like to do the tests. Golden stated that he did not.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening  Golden refused all testing.  Golden was placed under arrest for DUI/DWI at approximately 2308 hours. A search incident to arrest was conducted on Goldens person, no contraband found.I had Golden open his mouth to check for any foreign material that would interfere in taking a breath tests, nothing was observed.I then placed him in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle.  OBSERVATIONS:  -Making a left turn at an intersection with a visible sign displaying no left turn. -Driving the wrong way on a one way street. -Driving head on towards oncoming traffic. -Advised he was trying to go to 7-11 but went in the opposite direction. -Glassy and Bloodshot eyes. -Odor of an alcoholic beverage. -Admitting to consuming alcoholic beverages earlier that night.  20 Minute Observation Period  While at the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack D, Golden was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, so he could follow alongas the DR-15 Advice of Rights was read out loud. Golden signed the DR-15 at approximately 2331 hours acknowledging his refusal to take the test. Golden was issued all pertinent documentations regarding the incident. Golden was then released to a sober ride at approximately 0014 hours on May 7, 2023.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.  I request this case to be closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
