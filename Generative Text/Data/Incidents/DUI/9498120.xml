         <NarrativeText>N-36 is equipped with a mobile recording device, and body worn camera operational. Defendant: Osman Santivanez Balderrama 5/M  Date of Birth: 08/08/1985 Date of Arrest: 01/29/2023 Time of Arrest: 0033 hours DUI#: 23-026  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Successfully completed (6) month Maryland State Police Academy (6/2020).  * Trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (4/2022)   AUDIO VISUAL RECORDING: MSP marked patrol vehicle N-36 is equipped with audio visual recording equipment. Body worn camera also equipped.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On January 29,2023 at approximately 0010 hours, I, (Trooper First Class Emerick #6888), was on patrol in the area of the outer loop I-495 west of Georgia Avenue. While on patrol I observed a red GMC Canyon bearing Virginia registration UBF1218 that was traveling in lane 3. The vehicle was impeding the free flow of traffic, traffic was having to make evasive maneuvers to avoid colliding with the Canyon. I got behind the Canyon and conducted a pace, the Canyon was only traveling 45 miles per hour in a posted 55 MPH zone. I continued to follow the Canyon to get additional observations. The driver of the Canyon made a lane change from lane 3 to lane 4, while completing the lane change the passenger side tires crossed over the solid white fog line by more than one tire width.  As the Canyon was negotiating the S curves, in the curve to the left the Canyon crossed the white skip line separating lane 4 and lane 4 by approximately half a vehicle width. The driver of the Canyon then jerked the steering wheel to the right, to re-enter lane 4. After exiting the S curve, I found a safe location to conduct a traffic stop. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Canyon, on the Outer Loop of I-495 at Connecticut Avenue at approximately 0012 hours.    PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)     I made contact with the driver of the GMC Canyon, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. I advised the driver my name, ID number, agency I work for, that the stop was being audibly and visually recorded, and the reasons for the stop (impeding traffic, and failing to obey a properly placed traffic control device). When I advised the driver he was only doing 45 MPH he responded I am driving carefully. I then advised the driver that he was unable to maintain his lane and he stated I just want to get home I immediately observed the driver to have glassy eyes. I requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. I also observed an open glass bottle of Corona in the center cupholder, that appeared to have 1/2 of the bottle gone. I asked the man where he was coming from, to which he replied Maryland. I asked how much he had to drink tonight and he grabbed the bottle of Corona and said  this is the only one, I havent really been drinking. . As I spoke to the driver I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. The driver was identified by his Maryland Drivers License as Osman Santivanez Balderrama (5/M DOB 08/08/1985).   I then returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct an MVA check. The MVA check revealed the subject had a valid Maryland drivers license. I radioed to the Rockville Barrack and advised them to start another unit for field sobriety tests. I deactivated my patrol vehicles forward facing emergency lights.   I asked Santivanez Balderrama to step to the front of his vehicle, I then advised him that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he consented.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of the Outer Loop I-495 at Maryland Route 185 (Connecticut Avenue). The surface was dry, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear, lighting conditions were dark. I observed Santivanez Balderrama to be in decent physical condition.  I asked Santivanez Balderrama the following questions:  Glasses or Contacts  Neither. Medication  None.  Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pointer finger was used as the stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Santivanez Balderramas eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Santivanez Balderramas pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting nystagmus was observed. 1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes.  2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Not present  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed)  Prior to Santivanez Balderrama performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Santivanez Balderrama was instructed to place his left foot on an imaginary line out in front of him with his right foot directly in front and touching heel to toe. Santivanez Balderrama was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Santivanez Balderrama was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. Santivanez Balderrama was instructed to keep his hands down at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count each step out loud. Santivanez Balderrama was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Santivanez Balderrama was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Santivanez Balderrama was instructed that once he began the test he was to keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud, and to not stop until the test is complete.   Instructional Stage: 1.) Broke from starting position.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on step 2. 2.) Stepped off line on steps 4, and 5.   Turn: Completed unsatisfactorily.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)  Prior to Santivanez Balderrama performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed Santivanez Balderrama was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, and so on) and to continue the test until told to stop. Santivanez Balderrama was asked if he had any questions about the test to which he did not. Santivanez Balderrama balanced on his left foot.   Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: 1.) Right foot hit the ground. Seconds 11-20: 1.) Right foot hit the ground. 2.) Used arms for balance. 3.) Hopped Second 21-30: 1.) Right foot hit the ground. 2.) Used arms for balance. 3.) Hopped   Preliminary Breath Test (PBT): While on scene, Santivanez Balderrama submitted to a preliminary breath test. The results of the PBT were .16 BrAC.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Santivanez Balderrama was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. * Driving 45 MPH in a posted 55 MPH zone. * Glassy eyes. * Odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath. *Admission of drinking. *Open Corona in center cup holder. * Clues during standardized field sobriety testing. *.16 BrAC PBT result  Santivanez Balderrama was placed under arrest at approximately 0033 hours. A preliminary search of Santivanez Balderrama was conducted on scene. Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Santivanez Balderrama with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Santivanez Balderrama was also played the MVA recording of the DR-15 Advice of Rights in English. Santivanez Balderrama refused to submit to an evidentiary breath test.   Santivanez Balderrama was charged with DUI, and transported to Montgomery County Central Processing Unit.  Case closed by arrest.   All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
