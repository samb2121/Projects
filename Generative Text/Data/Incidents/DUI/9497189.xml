         <NarrativeText>S-45 is equipped with a camera; event was recorded via body worn camera. Reed, Julia Christina DOB: 04/09/1999 609 Little Kidwell Ave Centreville, MD 21617 Attachments:      Dr-15      DR-15a      DR-023      Citations     margin-left:8px"&gt;  MSP 033     Narrative: On April 15, 2023 at approximately 2325 hours I, TFC. Layton responded to NB RTE 301 in the area of Route 305 in reference to a motor vehicle accident. Upon my arrival I located a vehicle that had struck a guardrail. The vehicle was a gray Hyundai passenger car bearing Maryland registration 2EC5516. The driver and sole occupant of the vehicle was then located in the ambulance on scene. Prior to making contact the EMS personnel advised me that the driver seemed impaired. She advised the driver was slow to respond to their questions. I then made contact with the driver Reed, Julia Christina DOB: 04/05/1999 identified through MVA. She advised me that she was on her way home from a friends house in Elkton. I could at this time observe that Reeds eyes were blood shot, glassy. I also observed her responses to be delayed and her speech to be extremely lethargic. I asked Reed if she had anything to drink and she advised no. I asked if she had taken any other substances which she advised CBD. Reed refused any further EMS treatment and was then requested to preform SFSTs which she agreed to. I asked her if she wore glasses of contacts which she stated no. I then asked if she takes any medication which she stated yes a Benadryl. Reed was finally asked if she had any physical handicaps which she stated no. I noticed Reed was wearing sandals for the test. She was asked if she felt comfortable with them on for the test which she stated yes.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN): HGN was the first test that I administered to Reed. I used the tip of my black pen as a stimulus which Reed stated that she could see. I instructed Reed to stand with her feet together and arms straight down to her sides. I further instructed Reed to follow the tip of my pen with only her eyes not moving her head and asked if she understood, Reed stated that she did understand. I began the test by moving the stimulus horizontally approximately 12 to 15 inches away from Reeds face and slightly above eye level. After checking Reeds eyes for resting nystagmus and equal tracking. I began to check for a lack of smooth pursuit which I did observe. Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation was not observed in Reeds eyes. I also did not observe the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. After completing the test, I observed 2 of 6 clues.   1. Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  Walk and Turn test (WT):   The walk and turn test was then explained to Reed. She was advised of the instructional position for the test and was advised not to start until instructed. While explaining the test to Reed, she failed to remain in the instructional position. Reed then began taking steps forward without being instructed to do so. Reed was then instructed to begin the test. First nine steps: Reed completed the first portion of the test by taking 9 total steps. Reed raised her arms for balance, missed heel to toe, and then made an improper turn. Reed failed to turn around as demonstrated, instead Reed made a 90 degree left turn and began her second portion of the test.  Second nine steps: During the second portion of the test Reed missed heel to toe, stepped off line, raised arms for balance, missed heel to toe. Reed only took 5 of the explained 9 steps. After completing the test, I observed the following clues:      Cannot keep balance.      Improper number of steps.      Missed heel to toe.      Improper turn.      Starts to soon.      Raises arms for balance.     margin-left:8px"&gt;  Steps off line.     I observed a total of 7 of 8 clues.  One Legs Stand (OLS): Reed was then asked if she would be able to stand on one leg which she stated yes. Reed was then instructed to stand in the instructional position for the test while the test was explained and demonstrated. Reed then began to attempt to stand her left foot. She then began to sway. Raised arms and Put her foot down during the test.  After completing the test, the following clues were observed.      Sways.      Puts foot down.     margin-left:8px"&gt;  Raisearms for balance.     Reed failed to perform the tests to satisfaction and was subsequently placed under arrest for DUI. A preliminary breath test was then offered to Reed which resulted in a .000 DR-15 Advice of rights:  At approximately 2358 hours Reed was read the DR-15 advice of rights. Reed agreed to submit to a breath test. During the time the intoximeter was performing self tests, Reed vomited multiple times. The test was aborted and a new 20 minute observation period commenced. After the additional 20 minute period, Reedwas asked if she needed Ems which she stated no. An additional 20 minutes was waited for an observational period prior to the test. Resulting in a BAC of .000.   Reed became increasingly harder to keep awake Reed began to fall asleep (nod off) even while being spoken to. Reeds speech became increasingly slow and slurred. Several times while speaking to Reed I could not understand what she was saying. A Drug Recondition Expert TFC. Cambra #7191 was called out to MSP Centreville barrack. Reed was read her Miranda warning which she did not waive. TFC. Cambra conducted a consult with Reed which she refused to submit to a blood test and a DR-023 was then completed.  Additional: I am trained to administer standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Reed was released on citations to a sober party at the MSP Centreville Barrack. All events occurred in Queen Annes County Maryland </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Rolling Log Number: 23-006-0023 Training/Certificates: I am trained by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) Trained and certified as a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) Attended and successfully completed 2022 DUI College Attended 2021 DUI Conference  Breath Test:  The test was conducted at the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack. Reed had a test result of .00.  Interview of Arresting Officer: On 4/15/2023 I, TFC Cambra #7191 was contacted by TFC Layton #6847 in reference DRE evaluation after a breath test result of .00. TFC Layton advised his arrestee, Julia Christina Reed, of her Miranda Rights. TFC Layton advised me Reed invoked her rights and did not want to complete any additional tests. After arriving at the Centreville Barrack, TFC Layton advised me Reed was the sole occupant/driver of a single vehicle collision. TFC Layton advised me he observed Reed to have slow lethargic reactions. He also advised he observed her to have blood shot eyes, glassy eyes, and dilated pupils. TFC Layton advised me Reed admitted to smoking weed and taking benedryl in Elkton Maryland. TFC Layton advised Reed refused medical attention on scene. Reed then submitted to SFSTs where she was placed under arrest and transported to the Centreville Barrack for processing. TFC Layton advised that she was nodding off and that she vomited while at the barrack.  Preliminary Examination:  I observed Reed to be seated. I made the following observations:   Dilated pupils  Glassy eyes   Blood shot eyes  While speaking, she had difficulty answering any questions and at times was difficult to understand  Lack of concentration while answering    margin-bottom:11px"&gt;She appeared sedated and calm   While making observations, I spoke to Reed stating I knew she did not want to complete the DRE tests. Based on the observations made by TFC Layton, the clues of SFSTs not matching impairment for BrAC, statements made earlier to TFC Layton, and observations I made at the Barrack, I requested Reed submit to a blood test for controlled and dangerous substance. Reed refused the blood test. Reed was again advised of her DR-15 rights by the Maryland MVA official audio in its entirety. She was provided a copy of the DR-15 to follow along with. Reed again refused the blood test.  DR-23 issued. .</NarrativeText>
