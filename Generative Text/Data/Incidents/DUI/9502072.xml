         <NarrativeText>DUI#: S-24-001 DE Soundex: 1478254 DIGITAL EVIDENCE FROM MOBILE VIDEO RECORDER (MVR): I am equipped with Axon body worn camera. Event recorded. OFFICER EXPERIENCE:  I am certified through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in DWI detection and administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs). I have also have completed the Maryland State Police Academy.  PHASE ONE- VEHICLE IN MOTION: On Janurary 1, 2023, I, TFC Emerson #7196, responded to a automobile accident at 10700 Worton road, Worton, MD, involving two vehicles. Upon arriving I observed a Black Jeep Comanche with heavy passenger side damage and a Blue Chevrolet Equinox with heavy front end damage. After investigation of the scene and witnesses I determined the Jeep tried to make a left turn on Worton Rd and cut off the Chevrolet causing the accident. Their was only a driveway entrance where the Jeep was trying to make the left turn. The Jeep was at fault for the accident. I know through my training, knowledge, and experience that impaired drivers often cause accidents due to lack of judgement and impaired judgement from the alcohol or other drugs in their system.  PHASE TWO-PERSONAL CONTACT:  I approached the scene and observed the driver of the Jeep Comanche, later identified as Michele Ann Orzechowski, W/F/05/24/1988, was detained by OFC Baker of the Kent county Sheriffs office. Ofc Baker advised Orzechowski was trying to walk away from the scene of the accident and was not being compliant in the situation. I asked Orzechowski where she was going and she advised Wilmington, DE. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her person. I also observed Orzechowskis eyes to be very bloodshot and glassy. I asked Orzechowksi where she was trying to turn to and she could only advise she was following her GPS and the accident wasnt her fault. Orzechowskis speech was very slurred. I know the physical indicators of Glassy/Bloodshot eyes, slurring speech, and a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage are all signs of impairment.   I asked Orzechowski if I took her out of handcuffs if she would be willing to preform Standardized field sobriety. Orzechowski agreed to take the tests. I asked Orzechowski if she had any injuries to her that would keep her from walking in a straight line, standing on one leg, or from driving and she advised she didnt know and wanted EMS to look her over again. Based on Orzechowski having possible injuries I did not have her preform Field Sobriety. Orzechowski was very uncooperative with us.   ARREST DECISIONS (Probable Cause):  Based on my observations, I determined Orzechowski was unable to operate a vehicle safely. This is based on the totality of the circumstances from my initial examination of the scene, the personal contact with the driver. All the evidence taken, together, established probable cause for me to believe Orzechowski was driving while impaired and I placed Orzechowski under arrest.    Orzechowski was read the DR-15 in the hospital and refused to take the alcohol test.Orzechowski was issued the appropriate Maryland Uniformed Citations and was provided signed copies of the DR-15 and DR-15A forms Per policy and procedure. The appropriate DR-15 and DR-15A were mailed to the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Kent County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
