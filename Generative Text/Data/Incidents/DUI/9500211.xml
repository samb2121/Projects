NARRATIVE:  Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:    On August 21, 2023 at approximately 2346 hours I, Tpr. C. Merritt 7665, was on patrol in the area of US RT13 and Centre Road when I observed a black Chevy Tahoe bearing Maryland registration 751M016 sitting in the middle of lane two of N/B US RT13 with its flashers on. Upon approaching the vehicle, I activated my emergency equipment, the vehicle then started drifting N/B and then came to a stop still in the center of lane two.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact   I made contact with the operator, identified by Delaware drivers license as Craig Joseph Shull. I identified myself and the reason for the stop, and advised Shull that he was being audio and visually recorded. When asked why he was sitting in the middle of the roadway, Shull picked up an unopened can of an energy drink and pointed to it. Shull was asked to provide his drivers license. Upon Shull obtaining his drivers license from the center console I could observe numerous empty 50ML Fireball whiskey bottles, and an empty beer can.When asked a second time why he was sitting in the middle of the roadway, Shull stated,  honestly Im drunk. Shull was asked to remove the keys from the ignition, to which he complied. Shull was asked where he was coming from, to which he stated that he drank after he got off work. I inquired with Shull about how much he had to drink. Shull replied that he had two shots. When asked if Shull still resided at the Seaford, Delaware address displayed on his license, he provided me with a Salisbury address that was in the opposite direction from where he was driving. Upon contact with Shull I could detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle. I observed Shulls eyes to be blood shot and glassy, his speech to be slow and slurred, and his movements to be extremely lethargic.  Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening  Based on my observations, I requested Shull exit his vehicle. Initially Shull refused to exit his vehicle and stated he would not take any tests. After multiple requests,Shull exited his vehicle, he stumbled and laid against the vehicle. Shull appeared dishevelled. I could detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Shulls breath and person after separating him from his vehicle. When asked if he would voluntarily agree to perform Standardized Field Sobriety, Shull advised he would not.   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus  Test not taken- refused   Walk and Turn  Test not taken-refused  One Leg Stand  Test not taken-refused  Preliminary Breath Test    Not offered.  Arrest and Transport   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Shull was driving a motor vehicle under the influence: * Eyes glassy *Slurred speech *Lethargic movements *Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his vehicle  *Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person *Shulls self-admittance to intoxication/consuming alcohol   Shull was placed under arrest at 2351 hours. Shull was searched incident to arrest. Shulls center console contained (6) empty 50ml bottles of Fireball whiskey, (1) empty 24oz Twisted Tea, (1) empty 200ml bottle of Fireball whiskey, (1) empty 100ml bottle of Jim Beam Whiskey, and (1) empty 12 oz can on Yuengling beer. I placed Shull into the front passenger seat of unmarked patrol vehicle E-15. I then entered my patrol vehicle at which time I detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present in my vehicle prior to placing Shull into my vehicle. Shulls vehicle was removed by Harmon towing.  20 Minute Observation Period:  I transported Shull to the Maryland State Police Salisbury barrack for processing. Shull was played the MVA DR-15 advice of rights in English. Initially Shull refused the test; however, upon arrival to the barrack, Shull requested more time to read the DR-15 and consider his options. I observed Shull to read approximately a sentence or two near the top of the DR-15 and then skip down to the bottom and read the drug related DUI section. I observed Shull do this several times as well as flip through the three carbon copy sheets and read them in the same manner. I observed Shull flip the DR-15 over and examine the Spanish side of the form. Shull never indicated that he spoke or requested the Spanish version of the DR-15. When asked, Shull stated that he was fluent in Spanish, hewas offered the DR-15 in Spanish after stating he needed more time to read the Spanish version to see if there were any differences.Shull declined the Spanish version and continued to look at the English version. Shull read sections of the DR-15 in the above-mentioned mannerfrom 0019 hours until refusal at 0127 hours. During this time Shull would stop and ask questions not pertaining to the DR-15, Shull was asked multiple times if he had any questions pertaining to the DR-15, to which he replied he just wanted to read it.  Shull was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and transported to the Wicomico County Detention Center at 0301 hours. All events did occur in Wicomico County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
