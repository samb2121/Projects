         <NarrativeText>Incident was recorded. Q-23 is MVR equipped. Body-worn camera is equipped. Defendant: Tellish, Anthony William Date of Birth: 10/02/1984 Date of Arrest: 01/01/2023 Time of Arrest: 1916 hours Blood Kit #: Q365 Date of Blood Drawn: 01/01/2023 Time of Blood Drawn: 2205 hours Place of Blood Drawn: Washington Adventist Hospital Blood Drawn By: John Tablang MD License #: T-420-067-887-760 DUI #: 23-001 TRAINING/CERTIFICATES Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 1/1/2023 at approximately 1825 hours, I, Trooper Gonzales #7442 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack was operating marked Maryland State Police vehicle Q-23 in the area of northbound I-95 past Cherry Hill RD. I was responding to a call for service for a silver sedan off the roadway. I observed a silver Chevrolet Sonic with visible all-around damage and airbags deployed off the roadway to the left in the median in the area of northbound I-95 past Cherry Hill RD. The Chevrolet was bearing Maryland registration 72846CF.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the vehicle and made contact with the male operator who was the sole occupant. I observed the operator catch a shoe thrown at him by fireboard that was already on scene. The operator had difficulty putting on his shoe and once he stood upright staggered back five steps as well. I introduced myself to the operator and asked him what occurred tonight. The operator slurred and stated that he fell asleep operating his vehicle. I also observed a glazed look in his eyes when speaking to him as well. I asked the operator where he was coming from tonight to which he stated he was coming from Baltimore City after visiting a friend. I asked the operator for identification to which he stated his identification was in the Chevrolet. I asked him if he was the owner of the Chevrolet to which he answered yes as I asked him to sit down on the ground. The operator was identified as Anthony William Tellish (W/M 10/02/1984). A check through MVA revealed that Tellishs driver license was valid. I asked Tellish if he had anything to drink tonight to which he answered a few hard seltzers then clarified it to four. He stated he had the drinks a few hours ago; Tellish then clarified he had his first drink around 1600 hours. I asked Tellish how many drinks he had tonight to which he answered two to three and later when I asked again he stated he had one drink. At one point Tellish stood up to wipe his posterior after sitting on the grass for an extended period of time and I observed him staggering back and forth as he got up. At that time, I asked Tellish to perform standardized field sobriety tests to determine if he was safe to drive to which he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the left shoulder of northbound I-95 past Cherry Hill RD. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Tellish appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. I instructed Tellish to stand in front of my patrol vehicle. I asked Tellish the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  yes  reading glasses. Tellish was not wearing glasses at that time. Medical conditions or medication  yes  medication for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Injuries  none. If he considers himself a healthy person  yes.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. It was held approximately 12-15 inches from Tellishs eyes, slightly above his eye level. Tellish was instructed to look forward, keep his head still, and follow the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Tellish was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Tellishs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. It is to be noted that Tellish was swaying in place while this portion of testing was conducted. Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes. Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes. Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was not observed.  Walk and Turn (6/8 clues observed) Tellish was observed wearing black tennis shoes. The test was explained and demonstrated. Tellish was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe on a straight line. Tellish was then instructed to remain in that position until told to begin. Tellish was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. On the ninth step, he was instructed to keep his lead foot planted and take a series of short, choppy steps with his rear foot to turn completely around. After the turn, Tellish was instructed to complete the second series of nine (9) steps in the same heel to toe fashion. Tellish was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, count every step aloud, and once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed. Instructional Stage:   Cannot keep balance (two occasions)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Starts too soon (two occasions)  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Misses heel-to-toe (four occasions)  Steps off-line (three occasions)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Uses arms for balance  Turn     margin-left:8px"&gt;Incorrectly performed. (Did not keep lead foot planted, both feet came off the ground).  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Misses heel-to-toe (three occasions).  Steps off-line (two occasions)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Uses arms for balance  One Leg Stand (2/4 clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch the raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand, one thousand one, one thousand two, etc) and to keep his hands down by his side. I asked Tellish if he understood the instructions to which he states he did. Instructional Stage:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing to report.  Seconds 0  10:    Puts foot down (One occasion)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Uses arms for balance (One occasion)  Seconds 11  20:    Puts foot down (Once occasion)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Uses arms for balance (One occasion)  Seconds 21  30:    Puts foot down (One occasion)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Uses arms for balance (One occasion)  While on scene, I informed Tellish of his Preliminary Breath Test Rights. Tellish was offered a PBT to which he consented. PBT Result: .00  ARREST Based on the totality of the circumstances, I had reason to believe Tellish was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.    Slow lethargic movements  Glazed look in eyes  Slurred speech  Involved in motor vehicle collision  Clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Testing: HGN (6/6), WAT (6/8), OLS (0/4)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Driver admitting to consuming four drinks  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Tellish was driving under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a vehicle safely.  At approximately 1916 hours, I placed Tellish under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I immediately notified the College Park Barrack and searched his person for weapons and contraband along with a mouthcheck, all with negative results. Tellish was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and was transported to the College Park Barrack per department policy. Prior to being read his DR-15 Advice of Rights, Tellish was read his Miranda Rights at 1938 hours and asked if he consumed any drugs earlier that evening. Tellish advised he did not consume any drugs that evening. Tellish was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights in English from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration website and also given a copy of the DR-15 in English to read along to. At approximately 1950 hours Tellish agreed to take an alcohol concentration test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Tellish while on scene. Tellish was observed from 1916 hours until the time he submitted to an alcohol concentration test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Sgt. Long #5479 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Tellish had a result of .00 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 2008 hours. INTOXIMETER RESULT .00 BrAC  DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERT (DRE) After receiving the results of the breath test, I determined that those results were not consistent with the level of impairment that was observed. At 1955 hours I requested that a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) respond to the College Park Barrack to perform a Drug Influence Evaluation. Sgt. Fields #2789 of the Montgomery County Police Department, a certified Drug Recognition Expert, responded to the College Park Barrack and conducted a 12-Step IACP/NHTSA approved Drug Influence Evaluation of Tellish. Following the evaluation, Sgt. Fields found Tellish to be under the influence of a central nervous system depressant, impaired, and unable to operate a vehicle safely.Per Sgt. Fields guidance, Tellish consented to a blood test as blood kit # Q365 was signed out of the College Park Barrack and Sgt. Fields, Tellish, and I were enroute to Washington Adventist Hospital.Upon arrival, John Tablang of Washington Adventist Hospital took two samples of Tellishs blood at 2205 hours. Tellishs blood samples were packaged, sealed, and mailed to Maryland State Police Headquarters for analysis. Tellish was transported back to the College Park Barrack where he was processed and released to Ciara Jane McCaffrey Nejman (MD SDX: N-255-116-368-050). The defendant was issued copies of the following documents:    Citations  DR-15 Advice of Rights   margin-left:8px"&gt;MSP 33  All documents were forwarded to the Prince Georges County States Attorney Office.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Case closed by issuance of citations.</NarrativeText>
