         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-122 R HARRELL ID: 23-MSP-007267 Defendant: Jeremy Joseph Harrell TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 25, 2023 at approximately 2310 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Maryland 43, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a grey Toyota Tacoma failing to drive within a single lane. The Toyota was bearing Virginia registration UXH3402.    Right over dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Right towards dotted white lane line, then swerved left.  Drove on dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Right over dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Changed into lane two.  Drove on dotted white lane line with passenger side tires.  Took exit for Maryland 702.  Right over dotted white lane line with approximately half the Toyotas width.  Took exit for I-695 South from Maryland 702.  Drove on solid yellow fog line with driver side tires.  Drove on solid yellow fog line with driver side tires.  Drove on solid white lane line with passenger side tires. Then activated vehicles right turn signal and changed into lane two.  Drove on solid white fog line with passenger side tires.  Right over solid white fog line with passenger side tires.  Upon witnessing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Toyota on S/B I-695 at Chesaco Avenue.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Toyota on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle. There was a female passenger. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Alaska drivers license as Jeremy Joseph Harrell. While speaking with Harrell, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the inside of the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Toyota and requested Harrell to exit his vehicle. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking to Harrell outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Harrell stated he had four beers (Miller Lite). Additionally, Harrell stated his last Miller Lite beer was approximately an hour and a half prior to driving. Harrell also stated he was coming from a birthday party at his friends house and was driving home. I informed Harrell that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed in front of the Toyota on the right shoulder. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a green jacket, jeans, and boots.  I asked Harrell the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None Physical Injuries  Harrell stated he has inserts in his feet. I asked Harrell if that would hinder him from performing the tests and he stated, No. Medication  None Medical Conditions  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.    Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.      margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.      margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. I explained the instructions several times for Harrell. Harrell stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Nothing observed.  Walking Stage (1stNine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9.  Used arms to maintain balance on step 3.  Turn:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Did not complete turn as instructed.  Walking Stage (2ndNine):    Stepped completely offline on step 1.  Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 3 and 7.  Used arms to maintain balance on steps 1-9.  ONE LEG STAND  As I began to explain the test to Harrell, he now stated he has Plantar Fasciitis in both feet and that he is not comfortable with doing the test.  PBT #70005012: Refused.  ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Harrell was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2338 hours, I placed Harrell under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy. While being placed in the front passenger seat, Harrell stated, No professional courtesy, nothing? Harrell is a member of the United States Military. Harrell was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the Barrack, I made contact with Harrells ride. She stated, This sucks, he is on a zero tolerance. At this time, Harrell stated from the passenger seat of my patrol vehicle, Shut the fuck up Brittany. Harrell was taken inside the Barrack and provided with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Harrell was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. At 0014 hours, Harrell refused to take a breath test. Harrell refused to sign the DR-15 or the Order of Suspension (DR-15A).   INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****REFUSAL*****  Harrell was rude and argumentative during the encounter. Harrell was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
