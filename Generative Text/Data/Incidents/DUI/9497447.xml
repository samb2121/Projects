         <NarrativeText>DUI #: 23-036  MSP marked vehicle D-21 in car camera operational.   Defendant: Earl Thomas Carmichael Date of Birth: 12/07/1984 Date of Arrest: 02/04/2023 Time of Arrest: 0041 hours   TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: I am trained by the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer Standard Field Sobriety Tests. My training includes 32 hours of classroom instruction, and 8 hours of performing the SFST on volunteer subjects in a controlled environment.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 02/04/2023, at approximately 0013 hours, I, TFC ODonald #7284 was dispatched to The Bel Air Bypass just north of Harford Road in Harford County, Maryland, in response to a reported single vehicle collision with no injuries. I arrived on scene at approximately 0015 hours on 01/14/2023. When I arrived on scene, I observed a silver Ford Fiesta bearing Maryland Registration 4FC9788 off of the roadway on the southbound side of the Bel Air Bypass, near the 3.6 Mile marker.The vehicle had sustained heavy damage all around the vehicle and was disabled up against a tree of the drivers side of the vehicle. The driver, later identified as Earl Tomas Carmichael (2/M DOB 12/07/1984) was outside his vehicle rummaging around inside the drivers door. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached Carmichael and asked him if he was okay, to which he stated that he was, and that he was trying to find his phone. When Carmichael spoke, I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I also observed Carmichaels speech to be slurred. Carmichaels eyes also appeared to be bloodshot and glassy. I then asked Carmichael what happened. Carmichael stated that he was driving and lost control, identifying himself as the driver of the vehicle. I asked Carmichael where he was coming from, and he stated that he was coming from North East, Maryland in Cecil County. I asked Carmichael which direction he was traveling on the Bel Air Bypass, and he indicated that he was traveling northbound, which is in the direction of Cecil County, where Carmichael stated he was traveling from. I again asked Carmichael if he wanted me to call a medic to come check him for any injuries, and again Carmichael declined, stating that he was perfect. I then asked Carmichael how much he had to drink that night, to which he responded that he had just a little bit. Carmichael continued to look for his phone around his vehicle while I returned to my patrol vehicle to run routine checks on Carmichael and the vehicle. Carmichael then requested I call his cellphone to help him find it. Carmichael was then able to locate his cellphone, which was laying in the ditch several feet away from his vehicle. I then informed Carmichael of my concern for his ability to drive and asked if he would submit to the Standardized Field sobriety tests, which he agreed to.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the shoulder of the Bel Air Bypass at the 3.6 mile marker, Harford County MD. The surface was dry, level and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 16 degrees.Carmichael appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Carmichaels eyes. Carmichael was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes and his eyes only without moving his head until told to stop. Carmichael was positioned in a manner to ensure the vehicle lights would not interfere with the test results. I began by checking his pupils for equal size and equal tracking. I again observed his eyes to be bloodshot glassy. 1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  present in both eyes     WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) Prior to Carmichael performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Instructional Stage:   Lost balance.   Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Used arms for balance throughout  Took 7 steps (did not count out loud initially)  Missed heel-toe step 1  Stepped offline step 3, 4, and 5  Turn: completed unsatisfactorily. Stepped offline after the pivot  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Stepped offline on every step   Missed heel-toe on every step   Raised arms for balance throughout     ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) Prior to Carmichael performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed.   Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: raises arms for balance, sways, puts foot down Seconds 11-20: unable to perform Seconds 21-30:unable to perform    ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Carmichael was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol: -Admission to driving - Admission to having alcoholic drinks prior to driving - Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from breath and person - Slurred speech - Glassy, bloodshot eyes - Clues during standardized field sobriety testing  I concluded Carmichael was driving while under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0043 hours, I placed Carmichael under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. Carmichael was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and transported to the Bel Air Barrack. At the barrack, Carmichael was advised of his rights via the DR-15. The DR-15 was read aloud to him. Carmichael submitted to the Intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same. The result of the Intoximeter test was .11. Carmichael was issued all appropriate paperwork and was released. Case CLOSED by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
