NARRATIVE: Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion:  On August 13, 2023 at approximately 2057 hours, I, S/Tpr Wilkins was on routine uniformed patrol in the area of the northbound Salisbury Bypass and Hobbs Road, Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland. At that time, I was conducting routine patrol duties, traveling in lane #1 (left lane) of the Salisbury Bypass, and my vehicle speed was approximately 70-72mph. I was observing an unrelated vehicle just ahead in front of me in lane #2 (right lane). I looked in my passenger side rearview mirror, and observed a vehicle approaching me from the rear at a high rate of speed, and was rapidly approaching my fully marked patrol vehicle from the rear. I observed the vehicle catch up to my location and pass by me in the right lane. The vehicle activated its left turn signal, making a lane change from the right lane to the left lane. As the vehicle did so, it narrowly avoided striking the rear bumper of the vehicle in front of it in the right lane. The vehicle continued in the left lane briefly, before activating its right turn signal and returning to the right lane, now in front of the other vehicle. It was apparently obvious the vehicle was traveling well above the posted speed limit of 65 mph. I accelerated to pursue the vehicle, and initiated a pace of about one car length for a couple of hundred yards of approximately 80mph. The vehicle slowed suddenly once observing me behind it to about 74mph before I activated my emergency lights to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle.   I activated my emergency lights, attempting to stop the vehicle. I notified Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack of the stop, and identified the vehicle as a red Toyota passenger vehicle displaying Virginia registration VEL9710. The vehicle immediately tapped its brakes, and activated its emergency signal flashers. The vehicle bypassed several hundred feet of open, right shoulder of the highway to stop. Instead, it continued on, to the overpass of the Salisbury Bypass and Business Route 50. The vehicle crossed the white solid fog line on the right side of the roadway, appearing to pull over. I observed the vehicle jerking back and forth left to right, coming within inches of colliding with the jersey wall/barrier on the right side of the roadway. The vehicle veered back left, and then continued across the bypass exit ramp onto Business Route 50, back onto the northbound shoulder of the Salisbury Bypass. The vehicle finally came to a stop north of the Business Route 50 exit. From the time I initiated my emergency lights, the vehicle had traveled for approximately one half of a mile and took approximately one minute to stop.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact:  I approached the drivers side window of the vehicle, and contacted the lone occupant/driver of the vehicle. I identified the driver by his Virginia Drivers License as Rondale Lavon Dickerson B/M 11/30/1990. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. I noticed Dickersons eyes were watery and bloodshot, and his movements were slow and sluggish. I also noticed his speech was slow and slurred. He was having a hard time finishing his thoughts and sentences while speaking.  Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening:  I asked Dickerson if he had been drinking tonight, and he stated, I had one to two at my cousins. I advised Dickerson of my observations, and asked if he would be willing to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, to which he agreed. Dickerson wanted to advise me he was in, special ed, prior to performing the tests. After further speaking with Dickerson, he advised he consumed a, wine cooler, approximately a half hour ago. Dickerson advised he is not currently on any prescription medications. Dickerson was wearing a pair of flip-flops, which he decided to take off prior to starting the tests.   The area where the tests were conducted was on the right shoulder of the roadway. The area was flat, level, and free from debris. The area was illuminated with my patrol vehicles headlights, a streetlight in the area, and my flashlight.   Pre-Screening Questions: I asked Dickerson a series of questions prior to performing Standardized Field Sobriety Tests: * Visual check of inside of Dickersons mouth: Clear * Glasses: Dickerson does not wear contacts or glasses.  * Injuries/Doctors care/recent surgeries: No  I then began Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and I started with the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus: I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Dickerson. After explaining the test, I asked him if he understood the test and if he had any questions. Dickerson stated he understood the test and began. Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes present. Vertical Nystagmus was not present Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues: 6 of 6  Walk and Turn: Weather: Clear Surface: Level asphalt free of any debris I instructed Dickerson into the instructional phase. I then explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn test to Dickerson. During my explanation and demonstration, Dickerson could not keep his balance and broke heel to toe by placing his feet side by side. He had to be put back into the starting position. I asked Dickerson if he understood the test, and he stated that he understood. He began the test.  Instructional Phase: Could not keep balance Walking stage 1st nine steps: Stopped walking at turn  Turn: Incorrect; spun around to the right. Picked both feet up. Not as instructed.  Walking stage 2nd nine steps: Stepped off-line  Total Walk and Turn Clues:4 of 8 One Leg Stand: I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Dickerson. I asked Dickerson if he understood the test and he stated he did, he picked up his right foot to begin the test. Used arms for balance Put foot down Total One Leg Stand Clues:2 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test   I explained to Dickerson the reasons for using a preliminary breath test and asked if he wanted to submit a breath sample. Dickerson advised me that he wanted to submit a breath sample. Dickerson submitted a breath sample of .13 BrAC at 2127 hours.  Arrest and Transport: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Dickerson was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol * Driving behavior (sped past a fully marked police car, near miss striking the rear of another vehicle during a lane change, speeding 80/65)  * Eyes blood shot and glassy * Speech slow and slurred  * Movements slow and lethargic  *The odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle and his breath and person. * Admitting to consuming alcoholic beverages this evening.  * My observed signs of impairment.   I placed Dickerson under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 2127 hours. I placed Dickerson in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. After returning to my vehicle to begin transporting Dickerson to the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from within my vehicle that was not there prior to Dickerson being placed in.   20-Minute Observation Period:  Upon arrival at Maryland State Police Barrack E, I read the DR-15 Advise of Rights to Dickerson. Dickerson refused to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 at 2207 hours. Dickerson was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was released from the Barrack to a sober ride.  Dickerson was extremely polite and cooperative throughout the entire interaction.  All events did occur in Wicomico County, Maryland.  Case closed.</NarrativeText>
