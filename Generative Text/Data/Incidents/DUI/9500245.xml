         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack E    Incident: DUI, DWI  Location: Newton Street at Waverly Drive Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland  Suspect: Mellissa Katherine Henry (W/F 12/22/1970)  Body Camera Link: partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"&gt;https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=df03b0cccffe43ff97762675ca56aa75partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1 partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"&gt;https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=4161faea4f0f42f09fbc6f77d560bacepartner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  Dash Camera Link: partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"&gt;https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=773aa135b8c44916821a4be505245df2partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1   Subsequent Offender: Yes     Phase One: Vehicle in Motion  On 8/5/23 at approximately 0530 hours, I, TFC Huntington of the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack, responded to Newton Street at Waverly Drive to assisting S/Tpr Monk on a traffic stop. Refer to his supplement.   Phase Two: Personal Contact  When I arrived on scene, I made contact with the driver, who was identified by her Maryland license as Mellissa Katherine Henry. While speaking with Henry, I noticed her mood to swing, she was constantly fidgeting around/moving around, her speech was difficult to understand at times, disheveled appearance, could not maintain her thoughts and words, was not able to complete a simple task when asked. I asked Jenkins if there were anything preventing her from preforming a few tests. She stated there was nothing. I asked Jenkins if she takes any medication. Jenkins stated she took Clonazepam, Tegretol, Ingrezza. Henry stated she had taken the Clonazepam at 10pm the night prior, and the other two medications around 5am, just prior to the traffic stop. I asked Henry if she would be willing to conduct the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) to which she said yes.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Henrys brown eyes, and slightly above eye level. I asked Henry to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes, without moving her head and keeping her hands down by her sides. I moved my pen from side to side, twice, to see if her eyes tracked equally, which they did. Both pupils were noted to be equal size. I moved my pen in the same manner to check for the first (2) clues, Lack of Smooth Pursuit. Neither eye displayed Lack of Smooth Pursuit. I then moved my pen left of center out to Maximum Deviation to check for the next two clues, Distinct Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation. Each eye was checked twice, in which neither clues were observed. I moved my pen from center out to about 45 degrees, very slowly, starting with the left eye to check for the last two clues, Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees. Each eye was checked twice but Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees was not observed. I then moved my pen in a vertical manner to check for Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (VGN). Both eyes were checked twice, and VGN was not observed.  Clues Observed (0/6)   Walk and Turn The next test that was demonstrated was the Walk and Turn Test. The test was administered on a level, flat parking lot, clear of any obvious debris. Henry was advised to place her right foot in front of her left with her hands by her side as the test was demonstrated. I instructed Henry she would be walking heel to toe along an imaginary line with her hands along her side and looking at her feet. She was instructed to take nine (9) steps down the imaginary line, counting out loud every step. On the ninth step, I demonstrated how she was to turn around. I instructed her to take a series of small steps keeping the lead foot planted and to take nine heel to toe steps back to the starting location. I demonstrated the test which Henry advised she understood the test.  Clues Observed (5/8) -Lost balance -Missed heel to toe (greater than 3 inches for each time) -Raised arms -Number of steps -Improper turn  One Leg Stand  The next test administered was the One Leg Stand test. Henry was instructed to stand with her feet together and her hands along her side while I demonstrated the test. Henry was instructed to lift a foot of her choosing approximately six inches off the ground keeping her toe pointed out. Henry was instructed to look at her tow and county out loud by thousands: one thousand one (1001), one thousand two (1002), one thousand three (1003) and so on until I told her to stop. Henry was asked if she understood the instructions and she advised she did. Henry lifted her left foot, balancing on her right foot.   Clues Observed (2/4) -Sways -Hopping -Puts foot down -Raises Arms  Phase Four: Arrest  Based on the performance of the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, I advised Henry she was under arrest at approximately 0554 hours. Henry was then transported to Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack E for processing.   Phase Five: Processing  Upon arrival to Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack E, Jenkins was read out loud her DR-15 Advise of Rights Form. Henry refused to give a test of breath.  Henry was issued to appropriate traffic citations and was released to a sober driver. Each and all events occurred in Wicomico County, Maryland.  CASE CLOSED BY ARREST.</NarrativeText>
