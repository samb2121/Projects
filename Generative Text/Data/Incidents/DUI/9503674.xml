         <NarrativeText>DUI 23-002  This stop was recorded on in-car/body camera recording equipment in MSP unmarked unit R-12.  Defendant: Mungyeh, Jelvis Mungyeh,  Date of Birth: 09/20/1992  Date of Arrest: 01/01/2023  BAC: .15  Certification and training: -NHTSA Training certified to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) -Preliminary Breath Test Operator certified -Certified Radar/Laser operator -Advanced Roadside Impaired Driver Enforcement certified (ARIDE) -Assisted and conducted over 230 DUI arrests and investigations  Phase 1, Vehicle in motion On January 1, 2023 at approximately 0349 hours, I responded to the Outer loop 695 prior to Security Boulevard for a multi-vehicle collision. Upon my arrival, I observed several vehicles on the left and right shoulder. I observed a black Nissan Rogue in lane #1 against the left concrete barrier. I observed a Maryland registration of 6EN3760 on the vehicle. The vehicle was occupied by two people, a male, and a female. The male was identified as Jelvis Mungyeh, 1/M, DOB 09/20/1992. He stated he was traveling on the outer loop 695 prior to Security Boulevard and struck another vehicle. He was carrying a 9mm pistol on his person and provided a valid Maryland concealed carry permit.  Phase 2, Personal Contact Upon speaking with Mungyeh I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. He was vague about where he was coming from and was unable to provide an exact location of his previous destination. He had trouble maintaining his own balance, and was seated on the concrete barrier. He was offered medical attention due to the accident which he refused. Mungyeh also had red and bloodshot eyes which were droopy. His speech was slow and slurred.    Phase 3, Pre-arrest screening Based on my observations I had reason to believe Mungyeh was possibly impaired by alcohol which needed additional testing. Mungyeh voluntarily submitted to field sobriety tests. Tests were conducted next to his vehicle in lane #1. The entire highway was shut down due to the accident. The area was lit by vehicles and street lights. The roadway was flat and level but was slightly wet due to the previous rain that night. It was approximately 45 degrees out.   I asked Mungyeh if he had any injuries from the accident and he stated he did not. I asked him if he was under the influence of any medication which he also stated he was not. I asked him how much alcohol he had to drink but he was unable to state how much alcohol he had consumed.   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus, 6/6 clues observed. I instructed Mungyeh to stand with his feet together and his hands down by his sides. I instructed him to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes and his eyes only and to not move his head. He stated he understood the test. Initially, Mungyeh moved his head not as instructed but was able to then perform the test as instructed. I observed his pupils were of equal size and tracked equally, which showed he did not sustain any head injuries or drug impairment. I observed the following clues;  1. Lack of smooth pursuit in each eye, 2 clues. 2. Nystagmus at maximum deviation in each eye, 2 clues 3. Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees of deviation in each eye, 2 clues. Vertical nystagmus was also present, which showed a high level of alcohol impairment.  Walk and Turn test, 3 out of 4 clues observed. The next test conducted was the walk and turn test. I instructed Mungyeh to stand with his right foot touching directly in front of his left foot on a straight line and to not move until instructed to do so. I told him when the test began to take nine heels to toe steps forward, followed by a series of small slow steps to the left, and then another series of nine heel to toe steps on the same straight line. I instructed him to keep his hand down by his sides, to look at his feet, to count each step out loud, and not to stop the test until finished. He stated he understood the test. I observed the following clues;  1. Raised arms parallel with the ground during the entire test, 1 clue. 2. Stepped off line on step #6 on the first series, and step 7 on the second series. 3. Missed heel to toe on step #7 on the second series.  One Leg Stand Test, 4 out of 4 clues observed. The final test conducted was the one-leg stand test. I instructed Mungyeh to stand with his feet together and his hands down by his sides. I instructed him when told to start the test, to lift a leg of his choosing approximately 6 inches off the ground, to look at that foot, keep his hands down by his sides, and count out loud in thousands until told to stop. He stated he understood the test and what was expected of him. I observed the following clues:  1. Placed his foot down several times during the entire test, 1 clue 2. Raised his arms several times during the entire test, 1 clue 3. Hopped several times during the test, 1 clue 4. Swayed during the entire test, 1 clue  Based on the clues observed, as well as the physical signs of impairment I placed Mungyeh under arrest at 0416 hours. After concluding the accident investigation, I transported Mungyeh to the Golden Ring Barracks. He was advised of his DR-15, advice of right at 0545 hours. He indicated he wanted to take the breathalyzer test and indicated so with his signature. The test was administered by Cpl. Wilson at 0555 with a result of .15 grams of alcohol. Based on the result, Mungyehs license was confiscated. The DR-15a, driver order of suspension, was issued. His license was confiscated and he was released from the Golden Ring Barracks at approximately 0700 hours to his male friend. Mungyehs pistol which he was lawfully carrying was held for safe keeping, as I was not going to give it to him at the Barrack while impaired.   All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.   All events occurred in Baltimore County, MD.  I request this case be closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
