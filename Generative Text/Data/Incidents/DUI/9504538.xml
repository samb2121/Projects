Narrative:    On September 17th, 2023 at 0032 hours, I (TFC Phillips), was on marked patrol in the area of U.S. Route 50 and Logtown Road. At this time, I observed a black motorcycle at a high rate of speed in lane 2 of eastbound U.S Route 50.    Phase 1: Vehicle in Motion   The motorcycle was weaving inside the lane at a high rate of speed in lane 2. I had to accelerate to a high rate of speed to catch up to the vehicle.    As the vehicle approached U.S. Route 90, I was able to get behind the vehicle and activate V-16s in-car Kustom Golden Eagle II radar unit. I retrieved a digital reading of 74-mph in a 55-mph zone.    V-16s in-car Kustom Golden Eagle II radar unit was tested before and after shift and found to be working. I am certified through the State of Maryland to operate Lidar/Radar.    Traffic Stop:    I activated my emergency lights to my patrol vehicle, initiating a traffic stop on the motorcycle. The motorcycle was identified as a black 2022 Harley-Davidson FLHXS bearing Maryland registration #4062Y6.    Phase II: Personal Contact   I contacted both occupants of the motorcycle. I introduced myself and explained the reason for the stop. While speaking to both occupants, I observed the operators eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I also detected the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from both occupants. The operator was identified through his Maryland drivers license as Rodger Williams Geiger 3rd.   When asked how much he had to drink, he responded Had a beer or two. I also observed a white OC bike feast wristband on his right wrist. The wristband had 21 and over and Ride Safe Ride Sober on it.    As he spoke, I made the following observations.    I observed his eyes to be glassy and bloodshot.  He displayed a glazed expression on his face.  Detected the strong odor of alcoholic beverage from the drivers breath and person.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Slurred speech.   Note: License check revealed an alcohol restriction.   Due to these observations, he was asked to step in-front of my patrol vehicle.   Phase III: Pre-Arrest Screening   Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs)    The evaluation was performed on the road in front of my patrol vehicle. The surface was level and free from any debris. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight and vehicle headlamps. The weather was clear.   He was asked if he had any physical or mental disabilities, he advised he had a prosthetic leg from a previous accident. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.    When asked how many alcoholic beverages he had, he replied: three and advised they were Coors lights. When asked where he consumed the beverages, he advised Ocean City. His last drink was Hour and a half ago. Hour and a half ago.. When asked what time he thought it was, he advised 10 30. It was 0039 hours at the time. He advised he had 50/50 vision in his left eye and deaf in his left ear. He had brown eyes. He was wearing a blue shirt, Jeans, and boots. I continued to detect the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating off his breath and person as I spoke to him.  He had equal pupils, equal tracking, and no resting nystagmus.   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN): 6 of 6 clues      He displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  He displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.   margin-left:8px"&gt;He displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.    Note:    Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (VGN) was present. He swayed front to back throughout the test. He also stopped following the pen once.    VGN is an involuntary jerking of the eyes (up and down) which occurs when the eyes gaze upward at maximum elevation. The presence of this type of nystagmus is associated with high doses of alcohol for that individual and certain other drugs. *   Walk and Turn (WAT): Refused. Unable to perform.    One Leg Stand (OLS): Refused. Unable to perform.    Alphabet F-T:    He was asked to say the alphabet F-T without singing.

He responded 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46 then said You said 46, right?. I reminded him it was to 36. He continued with 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41. 40 40.
