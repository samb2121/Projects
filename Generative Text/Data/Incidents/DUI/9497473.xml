         <NarrativeText>The incident was audibly and visually recorded from my BWC. MSP unmarked unit D-24 is equipped with MVR equipment. DEFENDANT: POWELL, ANTHONY TYRONE Date of Birth: 05/28/1971 (51 years old) Date of Arrest: 02/23/2023 Time of Arrest: 1937 hours DUI #: 23-051 (Bel Air Barrack, Harford County) Subsequent Offender: No Minor in the vehicle: No MI-DL. # P-400-067-809-401 CDL: No Certificate and Training: *I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with participants at the Maryland State Police Academy and prior DUI/DWI arrests and convictions. *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *RADAR / LIDAR Certified 2019. *Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator Certified. *Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement Certified (ARIDE): Attended ARIDE with the Maryland State Police in January 2021 *UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND DUI INSTITUTE: I attended the University of Maryland DUI Institute, and I completed the course with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live participants (From June 5 to June 10, 2022) *Certified as SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge Martin H. Schreiber II in Baltimore City Circuit Court on September 27, 2022. *Certified SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge David E. Carey in Harford County District Court on October 11, 2022. *I have apprehended more than 160 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 23, 2023, at approximately 1918 hours, I, Trooper First Class Reckeweg # 7214 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Bel Air Barrack (unmarked MSP patrol vehicle D-24), was traveling in lane one (1) on eastbound Hanson Road 40 prior Edgewood Road. At that time, ahead of my patrol vehicle, I observed a black Buick SUV bearing Maryland registration 4EL0418. I conducted a routine check on the Buick, which revealed that the Buicks registration was suspended for an insurance violation. I observed the Buick make a right turn into the Royal Farms, go around the rear of the Royal Farm building, and make a right turn onto southbound Edgewood Road prior to Cedar Drive. I pulled behind the Buick, and a traffic stop was initiated as I activated my emergency equipment. The Buick stopped in lane one (1) on Edgewood Road prior to Willoughby Beach Road. I pulled parallel to the Buick and asked the driver to move to the Seven-Eleven (7/11) parking lot at 504 Edgewood Road, Edgewood, Harford County. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the Buick via the drivers side window, made contact with the driver, and explained to the driver the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver for his drivers license and registration. The driver handed me a Maryland drivers license. The driver was identified as POWELL, ANTHONY TYRON (B/M, DOB 05/28/1971, Maryland Soundex P-400-067-809-401) by his Maryland drivers license. I also observed a front passenger, later identified as Harvey, Maurice (B/M, DOB 09/29/1992). I asked POWELL where he was coming from and where he was going. POWELL advised me that where he was coming from was none of my god damn business, and he was going home. While talking to POWELL, I instantly noticed his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I detected an overwhelming odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from inside the Buick. POWELLs speech was slurred. I asked POWELL how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that evening, and he stated he had two (2) beers. I observed an open beer bottle in the drivers side door (12oz Miller High Life, half empty, see picture). I asked POWELL to exit and walk to the front of my patrol vehicle. I observed POWELL stumbling while walking to the front of my patrol vehicle. At the front of my patrol vehicle, I could now detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on POWELLs breath and person. I advised POWELL that I would perform standardized field sobriety test on him, which he agreed to submit. The summary of the first contact is as follows: Attitude: uncooperative Eye Condition: Glassy/bloodshot Mental State: Normal. Walk: stumbling. Speech: Slurred. I asked POWELL the following questions: Medication- Yes (high blood pressure) Medical Conditions- Yes (high blood pressure) Glasses: No (no wearing contacts) Any pain in the body- Yes (pain in the right leg) PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The below standardized field sobriety tests were performed in the parking lot of Seven-Eleven (7/11). That area of the parking lot was level and free of debris. Before beginning the standardized field sobriety tests below, I turned off my front emergency lights. The weather conditions were clear. Lighting conditions included parking lot lights, flashlight, and patrol vehicle headlights. POWELL appeared in good physical condition and displayed no visible signs of injury. I explained and demonstrated each of the below standardized field sobriety tests to POWELL. POWELL stated he understood my instructions and had no questions about the standardized field sobriety test. -HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) / (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: YES)  The first test given was the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. The tip of my index finger from my right hand was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches from POWELLs eyes, slightly above his eyebrows. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. POWELLs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I observed his eyes to be red. POWELL was positioned to ensure passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked POWELL if he understood the instructions, and he stated, Yes. The following clues and observations were made during the test: Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes The onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes Additional test Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Present in both eyes -WALK AND TURN (WAT) / (5/8 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: Yes) Before POWELL performed the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. POWELL was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. POWELL was instructed and demonstrated to put his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until instructed to begin. POWELL was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on each step. POWELL was asked to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count each step out loud. On the ninth step, POWELL was explained, and I demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and planted and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around to his left. POWELL was again explained, and I demonstrated that the second series of nine (9) steps were to be completed identically to the first. Keep his hands by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. I asked POWELL if he understood the test. POWELL stated, Yes. POWELL was instructed to begin the test. Instructional Stage: Started before instructed: POWELL started before instructed Unable to keep the balance: POWELL could not keep and broke the starting position as he placed his left foot parallel to the right foot. Walking Stage (1st Nine) POWELL stepped offline on steps 3, 4, and 7. POWELL missed heel to toe by approximately 2 inches on steps 5 and 8. Walking Stage (2nd nine): POWELL missed heel to toe by approximately 2 inches on steps 6 and 7. POWELL stepped offline on steps 3 and 4. POWELL did not complete the second series of the nine (9) steps. He took five (5) steps instead.  Turn:  Completed Unsatisfactory. POWELL did not take small series of steps to walk in a circle. -ONE LEG STAND (OLS) (LEFT LEG) (3/4 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: Yes) Before POWELL performed the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. POWELL was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given during the test. POWELL was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to watch his raised foot, count out loud by thousands (thousand-one, thousand-two), and continue the test until told to stop. I asked POWELL if he had any questions about the test (OLS) which he replied, no. POWELL raised his right foot. Instructional Stage: Nothing to report. Balance and Count Stage: 1. Raise arms: POWELL raised arms more than 6 inches on the 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, 21, 27, and 28-second mark. 2. Puts foot down: POWELL puts his foot down on the 3 and 23-second mark 3. Hopping: POWELL hopped on the 6, 7, 8, 17, and 18-second mark. -PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) (AGREED)- The final test offered to POWELL was the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT). POWELL was advised that he could refuse this test. POWELL agreed to submit to the PBT with results of .18 BrAC. ARREST Based on my knowledge, training, and experience as an MSP Trooper, previous DUI arrests, and clues gathered thus far, I had reason to believe POWELL was driving a motor vehicle while impaired (under the influence of Alcohol). * Physical control of a motor vehicle * Open the alcoholic container inside the vehicle *admission of consumption of alcoholic beverage *Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person *Bloodshot eyes *Slurred speech *Watery eyes * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) / CERTIFIED BREATH TEST (AGREED)/ SGT. PARKER # 5421 (Maryland State Police). I arrested POWELL for driving under the influence of Alcohol at approximately 1937 hours. POWELL was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to Maryland State Police Bel Air-Barrack for processing, where a mouth check was performed 20 minutes before his submission to the breath test. POWELL was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to follow along with as the DR-15 advice of rights was played to him from the official MVA website. At the conclusion of the DR-15, POWELL agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15, indicating the same at approximately 2029 hours. POWELL then provided two breath examples with positive results of .16 BRAC. POWELL was given all copies of pertinent paperwork, and POWELL was released to a sober adult that came to Bel Air Barrack. At the Bel Air Barrack, POWELL referred to the Criminal Enforcement Troopers that assisted me with this traffic stop as a bunch of white hillbillies. POWELL used profane language towards me during processing. INTOXIMETER RESULT: Results of .16 BRAC (2040 hours) POWELL was uncooperative, racist, and rude during the processing. Case Status  Closed by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.   </NarrativeText>
