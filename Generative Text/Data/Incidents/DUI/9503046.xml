         <NarrativeText>In-car camera operational, T-25. BWC utilized.  Defendant: Jony Leon Gonzalez Soundex #/State: No License Date of Birth: 05/05/1981 Date of Arrest: 04/15/2023 Time of Arrest: 0229 Hours DUI #23-041   Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1):  On April 15, 2023 at approximately 0200 hours, I, Tpr. Pettyjohn #7329 was operating my marked patrol vehicle in the area of Maryland Route 237 (Chancellors Run Road) and FDR Boulevard when I noticed a vehicle stopped in the northbound lane on FDR Blvd. After I was able to get turned around the vehicle was no longer there. At approximately 0204 hours, I observed the vehicle pulled over on the side of FDR Blvd just north of Old Rolling Road. I observed there to be tire marks on the curb of the roundabout and a pedestrian crossing sign lying in the roadway. I stopped to check on the driver of the silver Ford Explorer bearing Maryland Registration 6EZ4069.  Personal Contact (Phase 2):   I made contact with the driver of the vehicle via the passenger side window. The driver was identified as Jony Leon Gonzalez (H/M DOB: 05/05/1981) by his Mexico Identification Card. I observed the front right tire to be flat and damage on the front bumper. I asked Gonzalez if he was okay and he nodded while looking straight ahead. I observed the drivers speech to be slurred while speaking with me and glassy eyes. I asked Gonzalez if he spoke English and he stated Spanish. I observed a pack of Modelo on the floor in the back and a can of Modelo on the front passenger side floor. TFC Bauer #6719 asked Gonzalez how much he had to drink tonight and he stated three (3) beers. I then gathered the remainder of Gonzalezs information and asked him to exit his vehicle, to which he complied. I then asked if Gonzalez if he would be willing to conduct standardized field sobriety tests to which he consented. The results are as follows.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3):   The evaluation was performed on the side of the road, in front of my patrol vehicle. The surface was damp, level, and free from any debris or obstruction. Lighting conditions consisted of my headlamps, spotlight and my flashlight with my front emergency lights deactivated. Gonzalez appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, limps, or limb ailments. (Reference below for more information regarding any medical history or injuries). I asked Gonzalez the following questions and was translated by Tpr. Esuma #7574:   Contacts or eyeglasses: Gonzalez stated he did not wear contacts or eyeglasses.  Medications: Nothing to report.  Medical conditions or injuries which would inhabit his ability to walk in a straight line or stand on one foot: Nothing to report.   It should be noted, while speaking with Gonzalez outside of the vehicle I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed)   The first test was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The black tip of my pen was used as a stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Gonzalezs face. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the black tip of the pen with his eyes until told to stop. Gonzalezs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed. I asked Gonzalez if he understood the instructions and he stated, Yes.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degree  Present in both eyes   *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not present  It should be noted, while conducting Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Gonzalez would not move his eyes and had to be told multiple times to follow the tip of the pen.  Walk and Turn  (6/8 clues observed)   Prior to Gonzalez performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Gonzalez was instructed to place his feet together and place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe and imagine a straight line in front of him. Gonzalez was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in this position until told to begin. Gonzalez was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. Gonzalez was advised to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count every step out aloud. On the ninth step Gonzalez was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Gonzalez was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Gonzalez was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. I asked Gonzalez if he understood the instructions and he stated, Yes.    Instructional Stage: After being placed into the instructional position, Gonzalezbroke the instructional position one two (2) times. After being instructed not to start the test until told to start, Gonzalezstarted the test two (2) times without being told to start.   Walking Stage (1stNine Steps):    Steps of line on steps three (3), five (5), and nine (9).  Missed heel to toe greater than one half () an inch on steps two (2), four (4), five (5), and nine (9).  Stops walking on step nine (9).  Walking Stage (2ndNine Steps):    Stops walking after the turn.     Missed heel to toe greater than one half () an inch on steps two (2), three (3), four (4), and nine (9).  Steps of line on steps three (3), and nine (9).  Turn:    Did not complete turn correctly, Gonzalez looked at me for further direction after first nine steps and thought he was complete.   One Leg Stand (0/4 clues observed): *CANNOT DO THE TEST*  After being instructed on how to do the test, Gonzalez stated he was unable to do the test.    After the One Leg Stand test, I asked if he would consent to a preliminary breath test. Gonzalez consented to taking the preliminary breath test. The result was 0.29 BrAC.  Arrest:   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Gonzalez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath  Eyes glassy  My observed clues of impairment while he performed field sobriety tests  Striking the curb and sign with his car.   I arrested Gonzalez for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0229 hours. I then secured Gonzalez in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle (T-25), seat belted him normally, and transported him to the Leonardtown Barrack for processing. Gonzalez did not place any items in his mouth or remove anything from his mouth. A mouth check was conducted at 0230 hours. Nothing was located inside his mouth. During transport I played the Spanish version of the DR-15, Advice of Rights via the MVA website. After arriving at the barrack, I gave Gonzalez a copy of the DR-15 to review. After Gonzalez reviewed the DR-15, Advice of Rights, he signed his consent to submit to the intoximeter test. The breath test was administered by Lt. Evans #932. The breath test was translated to Gonzalez by Deputy Sales #358. The breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of 0.16 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.     All copies of the paperwork were completed and given to Gonzalez for his records. Gonzalez was released to a sober driver, from the Leonardtown Barrack. Charges:   Gonzalez was charged with the following citations:    Driving while under the influence of alcohol (00H0YXD)  Driving while under the influence of alcohol per se (00J0YXD)  Driving vehicle while impaired by alcohol (00K0YXD  Negligent driving (00L0YXD)  Reckless driving (00M0YXD)  Driving vehicle on highway without required license and authorization (00N0YXD)  Fail to display registration card upon demand by police officer (00P0YXD)  Case closed.  All of the following events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
