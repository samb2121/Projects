         <NarrativeText>Case#: 23-MSP-010423 Report: DUI Suspect: Rhonda, Rochelle Richardson.  Narrative:   On March 23rd, 2023, at approximately 1255 hours, I, Trooper Savilisky (ID#7460) and Trooper Barnhart (ID#7328), with the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, responded to 9310 Cherry Hill Rd, College Park, Maryland, to assist TFC. Coppedge (ID#6362) with a possible impaired driver.   Phase 1 ( Vehicle in motion ) See supplement.  Phase 2 (Personal Contact Phase)  Once on scene, I made contact with the operator of a silver Toyota Camry with Maryland Registration (1CE9459). The operator of the vehicle was later identified by her Maryland Drivers License (MD10273189566) as Rhonda Rochelle Richardson. Upon initial contact with Richardson, I was able to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. Richardson began to explain how she had driven to the location of the scene to pick up her god brother. While Richardson was speaking, I observed Richardson to have a slurred speech.  I asked Richardson where she was coming from to which she stated I left a friends of mine house. When I asked if she knew the address, Richardson was unable to give an exact address. I then asked Richardson to step outside of the vehicle to which she complied. While exiting the vehicle, Richardson used her right hand on the top of the drivers door to maintain her balance while exiting the vehicle.  While Richardson was standing behind the rear of her vehicle, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. I asked Richardson if her glasses were prescription glasses to which she removed the glasses from her face and stated yes they are. While Richardsons glasses were removed I observed her eyes to be bloodshot, watery, and glassy. I then asked Richardson if she had any alcoholic beverages to drink today to which she began to turn her head away from me and state that was yesterday. I then asked Richardson what time yesterday to which she stated two. I then stated two oclock in the morning to which she replied with yeah. I then clarified to Richardson that it was two oclock this morning to which she stated yeah, about one thirty, two oclock this morning, yeah.   I then asked Richardson how much did she had to drink to which she stated two drinks. I asked what did she drink to which she stated a mixed drink. I continued to detect the odor of a strong alcoholic beverage emanating from Richardsons breath and person. Richardsons speech continued to be very slurred during our conversation. At this time I asked Richardson if she would be willing to conduct Standard Field Sobriety Test to which she agreed.    Phase 3 (Pre-Arrest Screening)  Injuries:Richardson stated she had rods and pins in her right foot and leg. Richardson continued to agree to perform the standard field sobriety tests.  Medications: None  Glasses/Contacts: Prescription glasses. (Not needed to perform the standard field sobriety tests).   Richardsons field sobriety test results are as follows:  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 Clues)  Instructional Phase: Richardson was instructed to keep her head still, keep her arms down to her side, keep her feet together, and to follow my pen that was used as a stimulus with her eyes and her eyes only. When asked if Richardson understood the instructions I had given her she stated yes.  -Richardson displayed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. -Richardson displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes. -Richardson displayed onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  Note: It is worth noting that the sidewalk where the standard field sobriety tests were conducted was flat, level, dry, and free of any debris. Richardson also displayed equal pupil size and equal tracking during the HGN portion of the standard field sobriety test.  Walk and Turn (5/8 Clues)  Instructional Phase: Richardson was instructed to take nine heel-to-toe steps in a straight line. She was then instructed to pivot on her front foot after taking the ninth step and to take small steps with her other foot to turn herself back towards the direction she started the test from. Richardson was then instructed to take a second series of nine heel-to-toe steps in a straight line. Richardson was instructed to keep her arms down towards her side, look down at her feet while performing the test, and to count her steps out loud. I also demonstrated the walk and turn test for Richardson while explaining how to perform the test. I instructed Richardson not to stop the walk and turn test until she was completed with the test. When I asked Richardson if she understood my instructions she stated I heard what you said.  -Richardson missed heel-to-toe on all steps. -Richardson stepped off-line on all steps. -Richardson did not keep her arms down to her side, swinging her arms forward and backwards away from her body on all steps. -Richardson did an improper turn. Richardson slid her pivot foot backwards in order to partially turn herself around. -Richardson took an improper amount of steps during the walk and turn test. (Total of six steps on the first series of nine steps.) (Total of fivesteps on the second series of nine steps.)  One Leg Stand (3/4 Clues)  Instructional Phase: Richardson was instructed to lift either foot of her choosing for the one leg stand test. Richardson was instructed to raise a foot of her choosing approximately six inches from the ground, point her foot level to the ground, and to keep her raised leg straight. Richardson was also instructed to keep her arms down to her side, look down at her raised foot and to count out loud by thousands for the duration of the test. I asked Richardson if she understood the instructions given to her on how to perform the one leg stand test to which she stated yeah, but in my impairment its not going to work.  -Richardson swayed during all attempts.  -Richardson continuously raised her arms during all attempts. -Richardson put her foot down on all attempts.   Notes- Richardson balanced on her right foot for the one leg stand test. Richardson attempted the one leg stand test multiple times. Richardson continuously described how she was not going to be able to perform the one leg stand test while attempting to perform the test after stating she understood the instructions I had given her. Richardson was also asked multiple times if she wanted to refuse to perform the test to which she refused and insisted on performing the test. Richardson was only able to keep her left foot raised for a few seconds during all of her attempts.  Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Richardson was offered a preliminary breath test to which she agreed. Richardson PBT results: 0.083.   After making the above stated observations, I placed Richardson under arrest for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. I conducted a search to arrest of Richardsons person which did not reveal any contraband. Richardson agreed to allow Trooper Barnhart to move her silver Toyota Camry to a different parking spot, so Richardsons vehicle would not get towed from the parking lot due to it being parked in a time sensitive parking spot when we arrived on scene. Richardsons silver Toyota Camry was secured prior to our departure from the scene in a permitted parking spot.  I secured Richardson in my patrol vehicle and relayed her back to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack for processing. During the relay, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Richardsons breath and person.  Richardsons mouth was checked and negative for any foreign substances once arriving to the College Park Barrack. Once at the College Park Barrack, Richardson was provided a copy of the DR-15 to follow along with the audio recording that was audibly played for her in English. Once the DR-15 recording was completed, Richardson refused to submit to an alcohol concentration test at 0240 hours. Richardson was provided all copies of pertinent paper work for the incident prior to being released to a sober driver.  I request this case be closed per arrest.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On Thursday, March 23, 2023, Trooper First Class D. Coppedge #6362 of the Maryland State Police- Maryland State Apprehension Team/ US Marshals Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, was assisting members of the Anne Arundel County Sheriffs Office with locating fugitive, Brandon Allyn Meade (W/M DOB: 05/23/1992). Meade was wanted for Failing to Appear in reference for Felony Theft Charges and CDS not Marijuana Charges. Meade was also wanted, two additional times, through the Montgomery County Police Department for violating his conditions of release and failing to appear on Theft and CDS related charges. Investigators completed a work up on Meade. After an extensive review of Meades family life, social media and friends, investigators were able to determine that he was likely to be living with his girlfriend at her residence: 9033 48th Place College Park, Maryland 20740.    On March 23, 2023, investigators responded to the previous listed address and began to conduct surveillance in attempt to locate Meade. Once investigators arrived, they immediately observed the Red Nissan Versa, that Meade was last stopped in, backed into the driveway with no front tags. The vehicle appeared to be inoperable.    While conducting surveillance, at approximately 1150 hours, investigators observed a silver Toyota Camry bearing Maryland registration 1CE9459 pull into the driveway. The vehicle was registered to Rhonda Richardson (B/F DOB: 10/01/1965). Investigators positively identified Richardson as the driver as she exited the vehicle walked to the front door and knocked as if she was attempting to gain entry o the residence. She continued to knock, but her knocks went unanswered. Richardson then returned to her vehicle sat down in the driver seat and appeared to be waiting for someone.    At approximately 1250 hours, investigators observed Richardson back out of the driveway and leave from the 9033 48th Place address. As she backed out of the driveway investigators noticed she nearly struck a parked car that was across the street. Investigators observed Richardson back in and out of the driveway a total of three times to avoid the car parked across the street. As she left from 48th place she made a right turn on to Cherokee St. Investigators decided to leave one investigator at the 9033 48th Place address, while others followed Richardson in her vehicle. Investigators regained a visual of Richardson as she began to make a right turn on to Cherokee Street and drove slowly towards 49th Street. She made an exaggerated left turn on to 49th Ave and continued towards Delaware St. Investigators maintained a visual of Richardson as she made a left turn on to MD Rt. 1. Richardson continued on MD RT 1 making a left turn on to Cherry Hill Rd. She continued on to Cherry Hill Road then made a left turn into the Parking lot of the Seven Springs Apartments located at 9336 Cherry Hill Road College Park, Maryland 20740. She backed her vehicle into a parking space and continued to wait, as if she was waiting for someone. Investigators maintained a clear visual of Richardson from three separate angles.    At approximately 1310 hours, investigators made the decision to approach Richardson and interview her in reference to knowledge of Meade. Investigators made contact with Richardson who appeared to be under the influence of an alcoholic beverage due to her speech being slurred, eyes glossy, and her breath emitting a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. During the interview she confirmed she had consumed alcohol the prior night but wasnt currently drinking. She also confirmed that the original target Brandon Meade was currently living at the residence 9033 48th Place College Park, Maryland 20740.   TFC D. Coppedge contacted the College Park Duty Officer and requested assistance in reference to Richardsons impairment as she advised she didnt think she was impaired, and she would leave against officers orders. Trooper Savilisky and Trooper Barnhart of the College Park Barrack responded to the scene and conducted Standardized Field Sobriety Test on Richardson. Trooper Savilisky determined Richardson to be under the influence of alcohol and subsequently apprehended Richardson. (See original23-MSP-010423)</NarrativeText>
