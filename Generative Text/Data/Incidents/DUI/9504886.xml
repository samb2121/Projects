         <NarrativeText>This incident was audibly and visually recorded using the Axon Digital Video System installed in Maryland State Police Vehicle, U-32, as well as my Axon body worn camera. (7) Seven digital photographs were captured and uploaded to this report.   Defendant: Jason Anthony Walker  Date of Birth: 08/07/1987  Date of Arrest: 04/24/2023  Time of Arrest: 1637 hours  DUI# 23-037 (Prince Frederick)  CERTIFICATE AND TRAINING:   Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Safety Administration.  Attended the Maryland Highway Safety DUI Conference.  Enhanced DUI Enforcement School through the Maryland State Police S.P.I.D.R.E Team.  Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving School.  Trained and certified to operate radar and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  Apprehended more than 183 impaired drivers in the State of Maryland.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On April 24, 2023, at approximately 1619 hours, I Corporal J. Palumbo # 5974 with the Maryland State Police, currently assigned to the Prince Frederick Barrack, responded to the area of Stoakley Road and Prince Frederick Boulevard, Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland for a motor vehicle collision with injuries.  I arrived on scene in the area of 795 Stoakely Road, and observed a black RAM 3500 pickup truck with heavy damage to the front and passenger side, which had been towing a utility trailer. The RAM and utility trailer were partially in the roadway and the wheat field of 795 Stoakley Road. Two SMECO power lines were snapped in half with one on top of the RAM. Due to the positioning of the pick-up truck, and charged power lines down, I was unable to confirm the vehicle registration initially. Once the power was disconnected, I observed Maryland registration to the RAM to be 2ET0897, and the trailer to have Maryland registration 396099X. The two Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) poles had been damaged and dislodged from ground. SMECO was contacted and enroute to the scene.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I observed the male driver later identified as Jason Anthony Walker W/M, DOB 8/7/1987, who I positively identified by his Maryland Drivers License, standing outside his truck under the live power lines. Walker was within inches of a charged power line. I ordered Walker to move away from the power lines and asked if there was anyone else in the vehicle, which there was not. I asked Walker if he was okay, and I advised would start and ambulance to check him out. Walker had a few small facial lacerations. I confirmed with Walker that he did not strike his head.  I did not observe any evidence of head trauma to Walker, and he advised again he was okay. I asked what happened, and he advised he didnt know and stated the trailer may have gotten squirrely. Walker advised he was traveling westbound on Stoakley Road, and lost control approximately 100 feet from where his truck struck the first pole. There was approximately 8 inches of intrusion into the rear passenger side door with passenger side airbag deployment. There was a ride on lawn mower that was being hauled in the utility trailer, however it fell off and was now in the field. The RAM, utility trailer, and lawn mower damaged a small area of crops in the wheat field.  While speaking with Walker, he kept insisting on returning to his truck and specifically to retrieve his briefcase. Walker was told numerous times that he was not allowed to go near his truck until the power was disconnected. I observed Walkers eyes to be bloodshot and glassy.While standing near Walker and conversing with him, Idetected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I asked Walker twice if he had anything to drink. Walker advised no he hadnt and that he just left work and picked up his lawnmower. I asked Walker again, and advised him I could smell the odor of alcohol emitting from his breath, and he stated had just come from brunch.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  While standing near Walker and conversing with him, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I observed Walkers eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I asked Walker if he had consumed any alcohol, and he advised he did not. I then asked him again and told him I smelled it emitting from his breath and he advised he had just come from brunch.I asked Walker if he would perform Standardized Field Sobriety Testing, which he REFUSED.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST: Not offered due to refusal of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Walker was operating a motor vehicle under the influence Alcohol:  Involved in a single vehicle personal injury motor vehicle collision  Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Walkers Breath.  Observed Walkers eyes to be blood shot and glassy  Walker was placed under arrest for Driving While Impaired by Alcohol and Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. Walker was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights. After being allowed to consult his attorney for nearly 15 minutes, he ultimately refused to submit to an intoximeter test and was transported to the Calvert County Detention Center.  I responded back to the scene and was able to inspect Walkers vehicle and visually confirm the registration. An MVA check revealed the total gross weight of the RAM is 14,000lbs, which was also hauling the loaded trailer. There was a small area of crop damage to the wheat from where the RAM traveled off the roadway to the second pole. The owner of the property (795 Stoakley Road) , Thomas Leroy Bowen, W/M, DOB 08/12/1950, was on scene. Bowen advised he was the owner, which was later confirmed on the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation- Real Property Search. Bowen advised the crops were damaged and were set to be harvested later this year. The fuel from Walkers lawn mower was also leaking fuel into the field. Bowen was provided a case number and left the scene. Walkers vehicle, utility trailer and lawn mower were towed from the scene. Stoakley Road was reopened on 4/25/2023 and 0300 hours, nearly eleven hours later.  Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Calvert County, MD. </NarrativeText>
