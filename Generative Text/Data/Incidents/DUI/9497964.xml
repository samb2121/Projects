         <NarrativeText> Lawrence Eugene Windsor Maryland Soundex: W532488237356 Breath Test Result: 0.00  DUI Citation #: 0910YJL  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police.  NARRATIVE  -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION  On Wednesday, January 25, 2023, at approximately 0134 hours, I, Trooper Holder #7505, was on patrol in full uniform operating marked parol vehicle (T-21) in the area of Golden Beach Rd just after Charlotte Hall Rd, Mechanicsville, MD. At that time, I was facing eastbound on Golden Beach Rd when I observed a red Nissan passenger vehicle displaying a Maryland registration of 7AE0910. The vehicle was facing southbound in the left hand turn lane at the intersection of MD Rt 5 and Golden Beach Rd. The vehicle was not using its turn signal. I then went through the intersection. I made a left hand turn on Triangle Dr., turned around and remained stationary. The suspect vehicle then passed my vehicle traveling eastbound on Golden Beach Rd. I was traveling behind the vehicle and activated my Golden Eagle II Radar and obtained a speed of 70 MPH in a posted 50 MPH zone. It should be noted that the radar unit was tested before and after the stop.  -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT-  The vehicle came to a stop on the shoulder of Golden Beach Rd just prior to Laurel Ridge Dr. I made contact with the operator via the drivers side of the vehicle, I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. I then identified the driver as Lawrence Eugene Windsor (DOB: 05/10/1958). Windsor had his license in hand prior to me asking.As the driver produced his registration card, I observed that his head and body movements were lethargic and uncoordinated. Windsors speech was slow and slurred. I then asked Windsor how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed prior to driving. Windsor stated that he had too much and that he shouldnt be driving. As I spoke with Windsor, I made the following observations:  1. I observed Windsors eyes to be glassy and bloodshot. 2. Windsors speech was slow and lacked smooth articulation.  I went back to my patrol vehicle and conducted routine checks on Windsor. I then requested that Windsor exit the vehicle. I informed Windsor that I wanted to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFSTs). Windsor agreed to submit to SFST.  -PHASE II: PRE-ARREST SCREENING-  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs)  The evaluation was performed on the right-hand shoulder of the roadway in front of my patrol vehicle. Lighting consisted of my flashlight and my patrol vehicle headlights.  I asked Windsor if he had any medical or physical issues that would prohibit him from taking SFST or if he had taken any medication. Windsor stated that he had not taken any medication. Windsor stated that he hurt his knees from falling on a concrete step some days before our encounter. Windsor appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any obvious signs of injuries or disabilities. I continued to smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from Windsors breath and person upon his exiting the vehicle.  Windsor was wearing a baseball hat and a grey hoodie with pants.  **HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: 6 of 6 clues**  1. Windsor displayed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. 2. Windsor displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. 3. Windsor displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS  Windsor continuously had trouble following the stimulus. Windsor had to be continuously reminded to follow the stimulus with his eyes only and not his head.  ** WALK AND TURN: 1 of 8 clues**  1. Windsor could not maintain his balance during the instructional phase. Windsors feet broke from the instructional position on two separate occasions. Windsor refused to take the rest of the test. Windsor stated that he wouldnt be able to do the test successfully.  ** ONE LEG STAND: 4 of 4 clues**  1. Windsor swayed to the left and right throughout the duration of the test. 2. Windsor raised his arms for balance (more than 6 from his sides) throughout the test. 3. Windsor put his foot down on second 5. 4. Windsor hoped while trying to maintain balance.  ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS  Windsor continuously asked for a ride home and stated that he lived right down the street. Windsor stated on multiple occasions that he thought he was too intoxicated to drive and that he shouldnt be driving. Windsor stated that this would be his fifth DUI. The search of Windsors person revealed two alcoholic root beer beverages.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT)  Windsor refused to take the PBT.  PBT Result: Refused.  ARREST  Based off of the following, I had reason to believe that Windsor had been operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and drugs:  - Moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. -  Bloodshot glossy eyes. -  Lethargic head and body moments. -  Slurred Speech. -  Statements made by the operator that he shouldnt be driving. - Windsors admission to driving under the influence of alcohol. - My observed signs of impairment as he performed SFST. - Alcohol being found on Windsors person.  I determined that Windsor was impaired by the presence of alcohol in his system which affected his performance during the SFST. The inability to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests can also adversely affect the persons ability to operate a motor vehicle safely.  I placed Windsor under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0200 hours on 01/25/23. At approximately 0210 hours, I visually inspected the inside of Windsors mouth and no foreign objects were found.  TRANSPORT  Windsor was transported to the Leonardtown Barrack at approximately 0210 hours.  ADVICE OF RIGHTS  Windsor was secured in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. The DR-15 Advice of Rights was played via the English audio version of the DR-15 Form from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration website. Windsor stated that he wouldnt submit to a breath test at approximately 0317 hours on 01/25/23.  **INTOXIMETER RESULT**  REFUSED.  **TRANSPORT **  Windsor was transported to the jail.  CHARGES  Windsor was charged with the following:  1. Driving under the influence of alcohol. 2. Driving while impaired by alcohol. 3. Reckless Driving. 4. Negligent Driving. 5. Speeding. 6. Failing to use a turn signal. 7. Violating License restriction. 8. Driving motor vehicle with alcohol in blood in violation of license restriction.  Case closed.  All of the above events in St. Marys County, MD.  </NarrativeText>
