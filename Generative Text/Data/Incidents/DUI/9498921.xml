Narrative:  On 09/08/2023, at approximately 2155 hours, I Trooper Bynum heard a dispatch for an accident on Northbound Ocean Highway at Flower Hill Church Rd in Somerset County, Maryland. I responded to the scene and arrived at approximately 2203 hours. Upon arriving on scene and speaking with the operator of one of the vehicles involved identified as James Benjamin Doukas (2/M, 04/06/1985); Doukas told me he was heading Northbound on Ocean Highway in the area of Flower Hill Church Rd, and indicated the operator of the at fault vehicle identified as Russell Lael Henry (2/M,07/23/1958) pulled in front of him crossing from the median, in between North and Southbound Ocean Highway, over to Flower Hill Church Rd. This caused the accident to occur.  Another Trooper on scene spoke to Henry who told the Trooper he had been at the Redmens Lodge shooting pool, and he did have a couple of drinks. The Redmens Lodge Henry was referring to was later confirmed by Henry to be the one in Fruitland located at 103 Clyde Ave, Fruitland, MD 21826. The intersection of Ocean Hwy and Flower Hill Church Rd is a straight highway and Henry should not have had a problem viewing oncoming traffic at that location.   Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:  I did not observe the vehicle in motion however based off of the initial observation at the accident scene and statements from the parties involved Henry was found to be at fault in the accident. Please refer to the ACRS report that will be completed on Delta Plus.   Phase #2 - Personal Contact: I responded to Tidal Health to continue the investigation and upon making contact with Henry I detected the faint odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his person/breath. I also noticed Henrys eyes appeared watery and glassy. Henry admitted he had two drinks over the course of his time at the Redmens lodge. Henry said the two drinks he had were CLC (Canadian Lord Calvert) and Coke. Henry said he wasnt sure when he left the Redmens Lodge, but he got there at approximately 1700 hours. Henry said his last drink was at approximately 2000 hours to 2030 hours. The accident occurred at approximately 2154 hours. Due to those facts I decided to preform the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus portion of the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to help determine if I was going to offer Henry a blood test for alcohol in his blood. Henry did not remember much from the accident but did say he had taken his friend home after leaving the Redmens Lodge.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening: I asked Henry to try and lay on his back while he was in his hospital bed and told him to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes, and to keep his head still during the test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6) clues observed  -Lack of smooth pursuit: Present in both eyes.  -Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation: Present in both eyes.  -Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees: Present in both eyes.  - Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was not observed.  - Henry had equal pupil size as well as equal tracking.  Walk and Turn  Not completed due to unknown injuries/ability   One Leg Stand  Not completed due to unknown injuries/ability    Blood Test  Due to Henry admitting to drinking; having glassy and watery eyes; the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his person and his breath; admitting his last drink was only approximately 1 and  hours to 2 hours prior to the accident which occurred when Henry pulled out in front of a car driving towards him on a straight highway; as well as Henrys performance on the HGN test; I read Henry his DR-15 Advice of Rights and requested he submits to a blood kit test. I read Henry his DR-15 at approximately 2353 hours, and he agreed to take the test at approximately 0000:46 hours. Henry was unable to sign the DR-15 due to being in the hospital bed with his injuries.   The blood was collected by Loni Parker, one of Henrys nurses, at approximately 0053 hours. The blood kit was packaged and given to the post office in Eden, Maryland for shipment to MSP CTAU for testing.   Charging  Charges pending results of the blood kit.  I request this case remain open pending results of the blood kit.  All events occurred in Somerset and Wicomico counties. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  I received the blood results back which yielded a BAC of 0.04 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. I consulted with the Somerset County States Attorneys Office and came to the decision to not pursue any DUI related charges in this case due to the low evidentiary result. I believe the result was low due to the time elapsed between the accident and the blood draw. The accident occurred at approximately 2155 hours and the blood was drawn at approximately 0053 hours giving Henry right around three hours without an alcoholic beverage. On 11/5/2023 I served Henry with his citations pertaining to the accident as well as the MSP 033A (10-22). The paperwork has bee added to the attachments section of the report.    I request this case be closed by citations issued.    All events occurred in Somerset and Wicomico counties.</NarrativeText>
