         <NarrativeText>D-9 is equipped with a mobile recording device. Incident was recorded on MVR and body worn camera.  Defendant:Norman Joseph Wiley Junior Date of Birth:05/27/1952 Date of Arrest:11/29/2023 Times of Arrest:2116 hours MD DL #:MD-10272750490 DUI #:23-276 (Bel Air) Number of Prior DUI Offences:1 (2022)   TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Enhanced Impaired Driving Detection Certification through Maryland State Police SPIDRE team. *Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.) *I am approved by the State of Maryland Office of Chief Medical Examiner and Maryland State Police to conduct preliminary breath tests. * LiDAR/RADAR Certified through Maryland State Police. *I have apprehended more than 150 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Wednesday, November 29, 2023, at approximately 2037 hours I was dispatched to the area of Maryland Route 23 and Grafton Shop Road, Forest Hill, Harford County in reference to a two vehicle collision.  Upon arrival, I observed black Chevrolet Impala with front end damage and multiple airbags deployed, resting into the guardrail at the corner of Maryland Route 23 and Grafton Shop Road. I observed a Chevrolet Silverado with right rear damage resting on Grafton Shop Road just south of the Chevrolet Impala on Grafton Shop Road. The Chevrolet Silverado displayed a Maryland registration of 5AX5960. The damages observed between the two vehicles correlated. I spoke to the driver of the Chevrolet Impala, who was a off duty, in uniform, Baltimore County Police Officer, about the events of the collision. It was stated that he was traveling on eastbound Maryland Route 23 when the Chevrolet Silverado pulled out from Grafton Shop Road that the vehicles collided. Refer to collision report for further collision information.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the male driver of the Chevrolet Silverado, who was outside of the vehicle. The driver stated that he was driving the Chevrolet Silverado at the time of the collision. I asked about the events of the collision and he stated that he came up to the stop sign here and I looked and evidently, I pulled out in front of this guy here It was all my fault. I asked him where he was coming from and he stated The Moose Lodge up in Bel Air. I asked him where he was going he stated I live down on Reckord Road, I was heading home.. I identified the driver by his Maryland drivers license as Norman Joseph Wiley Junior, W/M DOB: 05/27/1952. I asked Wiley if he was injured and he stated No. While conversing with Wiley, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Wileys breath and person. I observed his eyes to be slightly bloodshot and watery. I asked how many alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving and Wiley stated 4-5 beers. I asked how long ago was his last drink and he stated Uh, about 45 minutes half hour ago. I asked Wiley when he started drinking and he stated Around 5pm. I asked what the alcohol he consumed and he said he Yuengling Draft. Wiley begged numerous times to let him go and that he feels that he is over the limit with drinking.  I asked if he would submit to standardized field sobriety tests and heagreed to perform the tests. The forward facing emergency equipment remained deactivated during testing.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the shoulder of eastbound Maryland Route 23. The surface was dry, level grade, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was cloudy. Lighting conditions consisted of slight overhead lighting, my flashlight and my patrol vehicles headlights. Wiley appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Wiley the following questions: Glassed or Contacts  Reading glasses, not wearing them. Medical Conditions/ Injuries  Right knee, right and left hip had surgery. Bad knee on the left knee. Medication  Lipitor, Entresto, Gardenal, Sprycel, Asprin. All taken on this date at approximately 0700-0715 hours.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Wileys eyes. I placed the pad of my index finger on the tip of my pen to provide a contrasting color on the tip of the nystagmus. Wiley was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Wileys pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Resting Nystagmus was not observed in either eye. Wiley was instructed to follow the stimulus with his eyes only. Wiley advised that he has a bad right eye; I observed a discoloration of the right pupil. Vertical nystagmus was not observed when tested. While testing, I observed Wileys body would slightly sway from front to back.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes   WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed to place his hands down at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. He was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Wiley was instructed to keep his hands down at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Wiley was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. On the second nine series of steps, he was again instructed to perform the steps in an identical manner as the first. Wiley was instructed that once he began the test he was not to stop until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Wiley if he had understood the test instructions and he stated, Yeah I guess.  Instructional Stage: Nothing to report.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch two (2) steps. 2.) Stepped offline by a foots width on four (4) steps. 3.) Raised arms from sides more than 6 inches for balance three (3) times.  Turn: Turn was completed satisfactorily.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on one (1) steps. 2.) Stepped offline by a foots width on three (3) steps. 3.) Raised right arm from side more than 6 inches for balance on all steps. 4.) Stopped walking one (1) time.   ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed) Prior to Wiley performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. He was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his legs straight, watch hisraised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Wiley attempted to balance one time on each foot choosing to balance in his left foot. Wiley attempted the test for approximately 6 seconds but ultimately stated he was not able to conduct the test.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Placed foot down two (2) times. 2.) Raised arms sides for balance on all counts.  Seconds 11-20: Nothing to report.  Seconds 21-30: Nothing to report.  While on scene, I explained and offered to Wiley a preliminary breath test. He agreed to the test, and the result was .08 grams per 210 liters of breath. The preliminary breath test was administered with PBT #1405785.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Wiley was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from breath and person. * Eyes watery and bloodshot. * Admission of consuming alcoholic beverages. * Clues during standardized field sobriety testing.  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Wiley was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2116 hours, I placed Wiley under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Wileys oral cavity was checked and was found to be clear. Wiley was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy to be transported to the Maryland State Police Bel-Air Barrack for processing. I utilized the Motor Vehicle Administration Advice of Rights DR-15 audio and played the fileto Wiley in English while responding to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks. At 2129 hours, Wiley stated he understood the form and agreed to submit to a breath test. Signing of the DR-15 was completed prior to test being conducted. Sgt. Stanley #4849 at 2148 hours yielding the following results.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ***.08 BrAC***  Wiley was charged with the following:  Traffic- 5C20MBG-Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Per Se 5C30MBG-Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol 5C40MBG-Driving While Impaired By Alcohol 5C50MBG-Negligent Driving 5C60MBG-Reckless Driving 5C70MBG- Fail to Yield Intersection Right of Way to Another Vehicle   Wiley was released provided all prudent paperwork in relation of the collision and the DUI and was released to a sober male driver on by 2215 hours.
