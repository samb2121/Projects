         <NarrativeText>T22 Body Camera and In-Car Operational  Defendant: Weber, Kathleen Marie Ellyn Date of birth: 07/16/1995 Date of Arrest: 10/16/2023 Time of Arrest: 2248 MD Soundex#: MD-10272878885 DUI #: 23-108  Scene Processing: I took two digital photographs of the outdoor gate damaged by suspect, Kathleen Marie Ellyn Weber. I took two digital photographs of the victim, Michael Terence Snavely, injuries in result of the assault from the Weber. Snavely and one of his employees, Ian Davis, completed an MSP Form 076, Written Statement. Snavely provided receipts from the Brass Tap indicating the alcoholic beverages Weber had purchased. I received video surveillance footage from Snavely pertaining to the incident.  Physical Evidence: Two (2) MSP Form 076, Written Statements, from victim and witness Two (2) receipts from the Brass Tap       Four (4) digital photographs, which were uploaded to Veripic and attached to this report       One (1) copy of surveillance footage of the incident burned onto a disk, which was captured on a MSP Form 67, Chain of Custody.   Narrative: On October 16, 2023, at approximately 2156 hours, Trooper Oliva Flores #7668 and I responded to 44940 St Andrews Church Road, California, St. Marys County, Maryland 20619 for a reported assault.  Upon arrival, I met with owner/manager of the Brass Tap, who was later identified by his Maryland Drivers License as Michael Terence Snavely (W/M DOB: 03/01/1967). Snavely advised me one of his employees triggered the panic alarm due to the fact he was getting assaulted. The suspectwas later identified by her Maryland Drivers License as Kathleen Marie Ellyn Weber (W/F DOB: 07/16/1995). Snavely advised he was telling Weber to leave the establishment, The Brass Tap, due to a dispute between Weber arguing with Snavely over an alcoholicdrink. Weber believedshe did not order and was falselycharged for. Snavely confirmed via video surveillance footage that Weber indeed did receive the alcoholicdrink that she was charged for. Snavely advised Weber got very angry when she was told to leave. Subsequently, Weber started making her way out of the establishment. Snavely advised he followed Weber out to ensure that the outside gate gets shut and locked once she leaves. Snavely advised prior to Weber leaving she turned around and assaulted him, by striking him in the chest with a closed fist. Snavely advised he attempted to deflect Webers closed fist by extending his arms out and attempting to redirect. Snavely advised Weber subsequently tripped on the establishments outdoor furniture and fell to theground. Snavely advised Weber then got back up and attempted to strikehim witha closedfist again. Snavely advised he grabbed both Webers arms and pinned her to thewall to gain control, so that she couldnt further assaulthim. Snavely advised he let go of Weber after she seemed to calm down. Snavely advised he demanded Weber to leave the establishment after letting her go. Snavely advised Weber slammed the outside gate multiple times causing damage to the outside gate. Due to Webers actions the gates paint was chipped off in multiplelocations. Snavely advised Weber left the Brass Tap and got into her vehicle. Snavely advised she drove off in her vehicle and minutes later Weber came back to the Brass Tap. Snavely provided video surveillance of Weber driving her vehicle and returning to the Brass Tap.  Snavely provided video surveillance footage of when the assault occurred. I observed the video which revealed Weber striking Snavely in his chest with a closed fist. I then observed Snavely attempted to deflect Webers closed fist and that is when she subsequently tripped on the outdoor furniture, landing on her knees. Weber then got back up and attempted to strike Snavely with a closed fist again but Snavely quickly reacted and grabbed both of Webers arms and push her up against the wall to prevent her from assaulting him any further. Snavely then let Weber go. Weber then proceeds to leave the establishment, as she leaves Weber slams the outdoor gate multiple times. Snavely and one of his employees, who was later identified by his Maryland Drivers License as Ian Davis (W/M DOB: 12/08/2000), completed an MSP form 076, Witness Statement. I photographed Snavelys injury from the assault, an abrasion to his left thumb. Snavely was not able to download and provide me with the video surveillance footage of the incident. Snavely advised he will provide the surveillance footage of the incident at a later time.    Vehicle in motion (Phase 1):   Upon arrival, I observed Weber sitting in the driver seat of her vehicle, bearing Maryland registration 5EB0052 on a silver Kia Forte, with the ignition on. Weber was parked in a parking spot located directly in front of the Brass Tap. Prior to our arrival, Snavely advised Weber was parked in a parking spot further away from the Brass Tap. Snavely provided surveillance footage of Weber being parked in a different parking spot prior to our arrival. I observed the video, Webers silver Kia Forte parked in a different parking spot than the one she was in upon our arrival.  Personal Contact (Phase 2):   I made contact with Weber, who was visibly upset standing outside her vehicle. Prior to making contact, Weber was in the driver seat of her vehicle and exited her vehicle as I approached her. Weber advised she arrived at the Brass Tap at approximately 1330 to 1400 hours. I advised Weber of her Miranda Rights, which she voluntarily waived. Weber advised she had only consumed two alcoholic drinks, one IPA beer and one Sam Adams beer. Weber admitted to drinking prior to leaving the establishment and then returning. When Weber returned to the establishment that is when Trooper Oliva Flores and I arrived at the Brass Tap. I observed Weber in the front driver seat of her silver vehicle with the ignition on, based on my observations, I did not see Weber consume any more alcoholic beverages upon her return to the establishment. Throughout the investigation Weber would become very agitated and start to scream at bystanders and other law enforcement on scene. Webers emotions were inconsistent while speaking with her. Weber would be calm and cooperative and the next minute Weber would become angry and start yelling at bystanders and other law enforcement officers. Snavely provided me with Webers receipt from the Brass Tap indicating the alcoholic beverages she had consumed. Based on that information on the receipts, Weber had consumed following alcoholic beverages: one (1) Crown Royal Whiskey Neat, one (1) Samuel Adams Oktoberfest draft beer, five (5) Buttery Nipple shots, and one (1) Goose Island Bourbon County draft beer. As I spoke to Weber, I made the following observations:   Webers left and right knee had small abrasions, which were consistent with the fact she tripped over the Brass Taps outdoor furniture as she assaulted Snavely.  Webers breath was emitting a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Webers eyes were glassy and bloodshot.   Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3):  The evaluation was performed in front of T-22, patrol vehicle. The surface was level and free from any debris. The weather was clear and there was no standing water/ice in the immediate area. Lighting conditions consisted of T-22 patrol vehicles headlights and outdoor street lighting. I asked Weber if she was wearing any contacts, Weber answered No. I proceeded to ask Weber if she has taken any medications prior to our encounter, Weber answered Yes. Weber advised she takes duloxetine and hydroxyzine. Weber advised she took duloxetine at 2030 hours and the hydroxyzine at 2200 hours. It should be noted that Trooper Oliva Flores and I arrived at the scene prior to 2200 hours and did not observe Weber taking any medication. Weber advised she has neck and thoracic pain, she also advised that she has a small gait. Weber advised her current conditions will not affect her from completing standardized field sobriety testing. Weber appeared to be in general good physical condition and did not display any limps or any limb ailments.  Weber was wearing a gray sweater, black pants, and black boots.  ** Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus ** (6/6 Clues)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Webers eyes and slightly above eye level. She was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only. Webers pupils were equal in size, showed equal tracking, and no resting nystagmus. I asked Weber if she understood the directions and she stated Yes. 1.Weber displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. 2. Weber displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. 3. Weber displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. Additional Observations: Vertical gaze nystagmus was observed in both eyes during the test. Webers eyes were blood shot and glossy.  ** Walk and Turn ** (6/8 Clues)  Prior toWeber performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be completed.Weber was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe.Weber was instructed to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in the starting position until told to begin. I advisedWeber to take nine (9) steps on an imaginary straight line in the pavement, touching heel to toe on every step. Weber was told to keep her hands flat at her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step,Weber was demonstrated and explained to keep her front foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around in a counterclockwise direction. During the demonstration, I demonstrated three (3) of the nine steps, both before and after the turn.Weber was instructed once she began the test, she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her side, look down at her feet and count every step out loud. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Weber if he completely understood the instructions, and she stated, Yes. Instructional stage: Weber could not stay balanced during the instructional phase. Weber could not remain in the starting position and instead she leaned back onto T-22 patrol vehicle as the walk and turn test was being demonstrated.  Walking Stage (1st Set of Nine):    Weber missed heal to toe on the following steps: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9.  Weber took the wrong number of steps. Weber took ten (10) steps.  Weber stepped off-line on the following steps: 1,2,3,4,5,and 6.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Weber used her arms for balance. Weber raised her arms almost parallel to the ground to maintain balance.   Turn: Completed unsatisfactorily.  Weber pivoted on the balls of her feet to turn around rather than the way explained and demonstrated.   Walking Stage (2nd Set of Nine):    Weber missed heal to toe on the following steps: 1,2,4,6,7,8 and 9.  Weber stepped off-line on the following steps: 4,5,6,7,8, and 9.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Weber used her arms for balance. Weber raised her arms almost parallel to the ground to maintain balance.  .   ** One Leg Stand ** (1/4 clues):  Prior to Weber performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Weber was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given and during the test. Weber was instructed not to begin the test until she was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised, she was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Weber was asked if she understood the instructions to which she stated, Yes. Weber raised her right foot. Instructional Phase: Nothing to report. Balance and count stage: Weber kept her arms raised almost parallel to the ground throughout the whole duration of the test. It should be noted that Weber also leaned back on T-22 patrol vehicle throughout the test to keep balance and that she did not count out loud. Primarily Breath Test (PBT) Results: Weber refused to take PBT.   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Weber was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: 1. Statements and observations made on scene. 2. Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Webers breath. 3. Webers eyes were glassy and bloodshot. 4. I observed signs of impairment as Weber performed the field sobriety tests.  Arrest: 2248 hours  Weber was placed under arrest at 2248 hours for driving under the influence. After placing Weber in handcuffs, she again began to escalate the situation because she did not want Deputy Smith to search her. She began to yell fuck that bitch and anyone but her. I informed Weber that if she does not want Deputy Smith to search her, and another female deputy is not available, then Tpr OlivaFlores will be conducting the search. Weber advised that would be okay. While standing at the front of my patrol vehicle, Weber stated Im a punk rocker and I dont give a fuck. Weber turned towards me and looked over my shoulder at Deputy Budd and Deputy Smith. At that time, Weber became very irate stating oh you think its cute. At that time, Weber tried to walk through me in order to get the deputies standing behind me. I used my right hand and grabbed Webers left upper arm. I escorted Weber back towards the front bumper of my patrol vehicle. I continued to hold onto Webers left arm and pushed her up against the front bumper of my patrol. The entire time Weber was using her body weight to push me backwards. While I was holding Weber against my front bumper, I was giving verbal commands to stop. Weber did eventually stop trying to push me backwards and did a 180-degree turn and sat back on my front bumper. Tpr OlivaFlores came over to conduct a search of Weber. While Tpr OlivaFlores was attempting to conduct a search, Weber turned towards the deputies and spit towards them. At that time, I took my right arm and went underneath Webers left arm and placed my right hand on her left shoulder. Doing this forced Webers arms into the air and causing her upper body to bend forward at the waist. It should be noted Tpr OlivaFlores did the same technique on Webers right side. Deputy Budd suggested putting Weber in his patrol vehicle with a cage to prevent any further harm to troopers or deputies. Weber was escorted to Deputy Budds patrol vehicle and placed in the back seat. Deputy Budd transported Weber to the Leonardtown Barrack T for processing.  Once Weber arrived at Leonardtown Barrack T, I played the English audio for DR-15, Advice of Rights form. During the duration of the audio being played Weber was very uncooperative and kept yelling at troopers. Weber agreed to submit to intoximeter testing and signed the DR-15 indicating the same (2332 hours). Minutes later Weber started to become uncooperative and refused to take the intoximeter test (2337 hours). After processing, Weber was placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to St. Marys County Detention and Rehabilitation Center, pending a bond review with the District Court Commissioner. Weber consented to a Primarily Breath Test (PBT) at St. Marys detention center. Webers PBT results were a 0.26 BrAc. Weber was charged with CR 3-203: Assault Second Degree and CR 6-301 Malicious Destruction of Property. Weber was also issued traffic citations for TA 21-902(a1I) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, TA 21-902 (b1i) Driving a Vehicle while Impaired by Alcohol, and TA 21-901.1 (b) Negligent Driving.  Intoximeter Results: Refused (2337 hours)  All events occurred in St. Marys County.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
