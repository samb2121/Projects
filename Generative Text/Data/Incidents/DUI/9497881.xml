         <NarrativeText>This event was recorded on my body camera. Defendant: Kyu Tae Yi Date of Birth: 1/15/1973 Date of Arrest: 1/4/2023 Time of Arrest: 0124 hours MD Soundex: MD10272238317 DUI #: 23-005(Golden Ring)  Certificates and training: *I am trained to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police andNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *I attended and successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) in April 2021.  Narrative:  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion On Wednesday, January 4, 2023 at approximately 0037 hours I, Trooper Hill #7277, currently assigned to the Golden Ring State Police Barrack, was dispatched to eastbound 70 ramp to inner loop 695, Gwyn Oak,Maryland. For a single vehicle collision.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact   I made contact with the driver and the driver, Kyu Tae Yi (A/MDOB 1/15/1973), who was identified by his Maryland drivers license, who was driving a light blue KIA Sorento bearing MD registration 9FD6927 . Yi advised that he was coming from his friends house and on his way home. Yi advised that he was driving and said that he must have fell asleep behind the wheel which sent the vehicle into the right shoulder guardrail and then into the left shoulder concrete barrier making the vehicle overturn on the ramp. While I spoke to Yi I observed he had bloodshot watery eyes and a strongalcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I asked Yi how many alcoholic beverages had he consumed today prior to getting behind the wheel. Yi advised that he had 2 beers before driving.Irequested that Wilson to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he agreed to take the test.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening The test(s)were conducted on the right shoulder oneastbound 70 ramp to inner loop 695. The surface was dry, level, and free from obvious debris.  I asked Yi the following questions:  Daily/Regular Medications - None  Glasses - None  Injuries - None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST (6/6) I used my pen as a stimulus and held it approximately 12 to 15 inches from Yis eyes. His pupils displayed no resting nystagmus and his pupils were equal in size. His eyes also showed equal tracking. Yis was advised to stand with his feet together and his hands down at his sides during the instruction/demonstration and throughout the test. I asked Wilson if he could see the tip of my stimulus and he stated, that he could. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Again, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. Yis was instructed to follow the stimulus with his eyes only, keeping his head still. After stating that he understood the instructions, Yi attempted the test with the following results:  *I had to explain to Anderson to follow the stimulus with his eyes only, keeping his head still multiple times throughout the test.  1.Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Yes  2.Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Yes  3.Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 degrees - Yes  4.Vertical Gaze Nystagmus test - Yes  WALK AND TURN (2/8)   Yi was advised to imaginea straight line in front of him. Wilson was instructed to stand on that straight line with his left foot and then place his right foot in front of his left foot with the right heel touching the toe of his left foot. Yi was instructed to stand in this manner while standing straight with his hands to his sides. Yi was then further instructed to remain in that position while the test instructions were given, the test was demonstrated, and throughout the test, which Yi had stated he understood. Yi was instructed to take nine heel-to-toe steps alongthe imaginary straight line in front of him. Yi was instructed that, after the ninth step, he was to turn around by keeping his front foot planted on the ground as he would take a series of small steps with his other foot to turn around. After turning around, he was to take an additional nine heel-to-toe steps back along the same line he had come from. I then demonstrated the test for Yi, taking only three steps, instead of taking nine for instructional purposes on each pass. I asked Yi if he understood the instructions, and he stated that he did. I then instructed Wilson to begin the test.  Instructional stage:    Starts too soon?     2 times      Turn    Unsatisfactory    ONE LEG STAND (0/4)  Prior to Yi performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Yi was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, one thousand-three, etc...) and to continue the test until told to stop. Wilson was asked and shown multiple times to ensure he understood how to properly perform the test. He stated, Yes I understand.    No notes   *Preliminary Breath Test- results: Refusal  I placed Yi under arrest for DUI/DWI at approximately 0124 hours. A search incident to arrest was conducted and no additional contraband was located on his person.Yi was then placed in the passenger side of my patrol vehicle and taken to the Golden Ring State Police Barrack for further processing.  *Intoximeter- results: Refusal at 0148 hours  OBSERVATIONS: Bloodshot glassy eyes Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage HGN: 6/6 WAT: 2/8 OLS: 0/4  Yi was released tohis son from the Golden Ring Barrack.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland. I request this case to be closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
