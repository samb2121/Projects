         <NarrativeText> Maryland State Police North East Barrack F  MSP unmarked vehicle F-10 is equipped with a mobile recording device. I, TFC Yocum #6934 am equipped with a body worn camera. The incident was recorded.  DEFENDANT: NAGLE, MARK ALLEN Date of Birth: 06/12/1968 Date of Arrest: 02/04/2023 Time of Arrest: 1706 hours (5:06 PM) MD SDX#: MD10273375209 DUI #: 23-033 (North East Barrack F)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). * I am trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driver Enforcement (ARIDE). * I have apprehended more than 150 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1): On February 4, 2023, at approximately 1645 hours, I, Trooper First Class Yocum #6934 was on duty and in full uniform, operating Maryland State Police unmarked police cruiser F-10. At this time, I was at eastbound Pulaski Highway at Delaware Avenue, investigation a motor vehicle collision involving a pedestrian strike when another collision occurred within the scene. Through investigations, it was discovered that the at-fault vehicle, 2007 gray Honda Pilot displaying Maryland registration OCM0360 struck the non-at-fault vehicle in the rear.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2): I contacted the driver/sole occupant of the Honda, who would be identified by his Maryland drivers license as Mark Allen Nagle (DOB: 06/12/1968 2/M). I introduced myself to Nagle, and advised him that we were being audibly and visually recorded. I asked Nagle what occurred, to which he advised the car in front him stopped suddenly, and he struck them. While speaking with Nagle, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I also observed his eyes to be watery, glassy, and bloodshot. I asked Nagle how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed, to which he stated, a couple beers. I asked Nagle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3): The evaluation was performed on the sidewalk for eastbound Pulaski Highway. The surface was solid, flat, and free from any debris. The weather condition at the time was no precipitation and approximately 40 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of daylight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Nagle appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. I asked Nagle the following questions:  I asked Nagle where he was coming from, to which he advised Elkton, and headed to Crisfield, Maryland. Nagle advised he was coming from his friends birthday/graduation party.  I then asked Nagle on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blackout drunk, and one not feeling anything where he would put himself. Nagle stated, A three, a two. Nagle advised the beer he was consuming were Natural Lights.  Medication  Antidepressants taken at 0700. Physical injuries/ disabilities  shoulder replacement, Sciatica, Glasses/ Contacts  Wears glasses.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) I gave instructions on how the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was to be performed. I asked Nagle if he understood all instructions and demonstrations, to which he stated, Yes.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes. *Vertical Nystagmus was present in both eyes*  WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed) I gave instructions and fully demonstrated how the Walk and Turn test was to be performed. I asked Nagle if he understood all instructions and demonstrations, to which he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Cannot keep balance.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe. 2.) Steps off line. 3.) Raised arms for balance. 4.) Stopped walking.  Once Nagle got to the fifth (5th) step, he lost balance and stated, It aint going to happen. Nagle then stopped doing the test.  Turn: Did not make it to turn.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): N/A  ONE LEG STAND (4/4 clues observed) I gave instructions and fully demonstrated how the One Leg Stand test was to be performed. I asked Nagle if he understood all instructions and demonstrations, to which he stated, Yes. Seconds 0-30: 1.) Raised arms for balance. 2.) Swayed back and forth. 3.) Put foot down. 4.) Hops on one foot.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Nagle was driving under the influence:  - Vehicle in motion (At-fault of motor vehicle collision). - Glassy, watery, bloodshot eyes. - Detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from drivers breath and person. - Driver admitted to consuming a couple beers. (Natural Light) - Clues observed during standardized field sobriety testing.  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Nagle was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 1706 hours (5:06 PM), I placed Nagle under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence. Nagle was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to Maryland State Police North East Barrack for processing.  Nagle was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights in English. Nagle was also provided a copy to view. At 1737 hours (5:37 PM), Nagle elected to submit the breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: Nagle was observed during the entire observation period and did not place anything in or near his mouth.  INTOXIMETER RESULTS: Nagle took a test of breath at 1748 hours (5:48 PM). His results were: .16 BrAC.  All appropriate citations were issued to Nagle, and he was provided copies of all pertinent paperwork. Nagle was advised he could not operate a motor vehicle for 12 hours. A warrant check of Nagle revealed that he had a warrant for his arrest through Ocean City for second degree assault. Nagle was seen in front of a Cecil County District Court Commissioner for his pre-trial bail review. Nagle was held on no bail and transported to the Cecil County Detention Center.  Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
