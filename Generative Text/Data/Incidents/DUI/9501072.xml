         <NarrativeText> Patrol Vehicle Information- Q11 (Marked) is equipped with a mobile recording device.  Defendant: Renico Lamont Williams  Date Of Arrest: 11/07/2023  Time Of Arrest: 0939 hours  Officers Training/Experience  *Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Eastern Shore Criminal Justice Academy and the Maryland State Police Academy.  *Trained and certified to operate Radar through the Maryland State Police.  *Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE).    VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On November 7, 2023, at approximately 0917hours, I Trooper Nikodemski #7510 observed a State Highway Administration Vehicle (SHA) behind a black, Nissan Maxima displaying Maryland registration 2CK9408 in the area of the right shoulder of the I/L 495 at Baltimore Washington Parkway, Greenbelt,Prince Georges County, Maryland. I proceeded to stop out with the both vehicles and spoke to the driver of the SHA vehicle who advised that the driver of the black Nissan was asleep behind the wheel and was not responding when he knocked on his window.    PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I positioned my vehicle behind the Nissan and attempted to make contact with the driver and sole occupant later identified Renico Williams. I observed Williams to be asleep in the drivers seat with the vehicle running and in park. Williams could be observed sleeping and unaware of any events around him. I knocked on the window until Williams woke and exclaimed that he was just driving down the road, although his vehicle was currently parked on the shoulder. I observed Williams to have a heavy odor of an acholic beverage to be emanating from his breath and person. I observed Williams to have red, glassy, eyes. I asked Williams if he had consumed any alcohol prior to driving to which Williams stated that he had drank early in the day but was not specific and only stated that he had drank beer. I requested Williams exit the vehicle so that I could preform, so I could preform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) to see if he was safe to operate a motor vehicle.  At this point in time Trooper Albaugh had also arrived on scene.   Williams was placed in front of his vehicle to preform SFSTs. While walking from his vehicle, I observedWilliams to make slow and lethargic movements while walking from his vehicle.  A routine check of Williams license and wanted status revealed that he possessed a valid drivers license and was not wanted.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the roadway, at the front of my patrol vehicle. The roadway where the following tests were conducted was level, free and clear of any debris. It was clear weather. Williams was asked pre-evaluation screening questions and stated that he was a diabetic and that may affect his ability to preform my tests, more specifically according to him his balance and coordination may be affected.    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Williams eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. His pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. Williams was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated yes. At this time I could still observe a heavy odor of an alcoholic beverage still emanating from his breath and person.    I asked Williams if he was able to see the tip of my pen to which Williams stated yes.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes  3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  4.) Vertical Nystagmus - Present in both eyes    WALK AND TURN (1/8 clues observed)    Prior to Williams performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Daniel was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin.    William was wearing a sneaker style shoe.  1.) Balance-Remained as instructed.  2.) Starts too soon-Remained as instructed.  3.) Stops walking- Completed as demonstrated.  4.) Misses to toe- Completed as demonstrated.  5.) Steps off-line- Completed as demonstrated.  6.) Raises arms -Completed as demonstrated.  7.) Actual # steps -Completed as demonstrated.  8.) Improper turn -Williams competed the turn but went the wrong direction.    ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed)    Prior to Williams performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. He was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Williams was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated yes.    Williams chose to balance on his left foot, raising his right.  1.) Sways-Completed as demonstrated.  2.) Raises arms -Completed as demonstrated.  3.) Hopps- Completed as demonstrated.  4.) Puts foot down - Williams put his foot down multiple times during the test.    ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Williams was driving a motor vehicle under the influence:  -Falling asleep on the shoulder of the roadway.  -Multiple Clues during Field Sobriety Testing.  -Poor balance and coordination.  -Slow and lethargic movements.  -Williams had a heavy odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  -Williams had watery blood shot eyes.    Williams was offered a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) but refused.  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Williams was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0939 hours, I placed Williams under arrest for driving while impaired. Williams was placed in my patrol vehicle and read aloud by audio clip the DR-15 Advice of Rights at approximately 0949 hours from the Motor VehicleAdministration website. Williams upon being read the Advice of Rights agreed to take the test at approximately 1140 hours after consulting with his lawyer.  Williams was upon being transported to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack submitted to an intoximeter test at approximately 1051 hours, which was conducted by Sgt. Mujaihid Jones.    INTOXIMETER RESULT:.*007*  Williams was issued copies of MVA paperwork to include the DR-15 and Intox. sheet.  Williams was also issued traffic citations related to DUI prior to being released to a sober driver.  It should be noted that Williams vehicle was tagged and secured on the shoulder of the roadway.    All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Case Status-CLOSED </NarrativeText>
