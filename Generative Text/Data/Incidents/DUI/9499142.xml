         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack J-19 In-Car and Body Camera Operational Maryland State Police DUI J-23-088 ***REPEAT OFFENDER*** LICENSE INFO: MD-10273029472 Brendan Matthew Hewes W/M DOB: 05/12/1995; 5938 Linthicum Lane, Linthicum Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Phone Number: 443-981-9053 TRAINING / CERTIFICATE:   Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Administration. (June 2020)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Certified RADAR / LIDAR Operator.  VEHICLE IN MOTION: (PHASE 1)  On Wednesday, May 24, 2023, at approximately 1825 hours I, TFC Yu #7292 was dispatched to a white Ford Pickup truck stopped in the roadway westbound US Route 50 east of northbound I-97 on ramp. The call was in regard to the driver slumped over the steering wheel of the vehicle in lane 2. I arrived on scene and observed a white Ford F-150 with a trailer hauling a jet ski stopped in lane 2 of the roadway. PERSONAL CONTACT: (PHASE 2) I approached the vehicle and made contact with the driver identified through his Maryland Identification Card as Brendan Matthew Hewes W/M DOB: 05/12/1995. A NCIC/METERS check revealed Hewes did not have a valid Drivers License. Upon making contact with Hewes, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I observed Hewes to be the only occupant in the Ford. I observed Hewes eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I also observed multiple White Claw Hard Seltzer Cans open in the center console and passengers side door. I also observed in plain view a partially burnt suspected Cannabis cigarette, a multicolor glass smoking device containing suspected Cannabis residue, and one black foil baggie containing suspected Cannabis. I also observed an empty variety pack of White Claw Hard Seltzers and Coors Light Beer Box in the backseat. Hewes also had a empty backpack cooler by his Jet Ski. Hewes appeared to be shirtless with a cut on his lip. I asked Hewes to exit his vehicle and step onto the left shoulder. Senior Trooper Matthews #5973 moved Hewes vehicle onto the right shoulder. Anne Arundel Fire Department Paramedics arrived on scene but Hewes refused treatment. I asked Hewes where he was coming from, he advised he was on his way home from watching the Blue Angels. Hewes advised he was on his jet ski by the Truxton Park Docks in Annapolis. While speaking to Hewes, the odor of an alcoholic beverage became stronger. I asked Hewes how many alcoholic beverages he had prior to driving, Hewes advised none. I requested Hewes submit to the Standardized Field Sobriety Test while explaining each test to him. Hewes refused to submit to all 3 Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. ARREST FOR DUI:  I placed Hewes under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol at approximately 1836 hours. I transported Hewes to the Annapolis Barrack for further processing. Hewes vehicle was towed by Marc Bowen Tow Services due to the vehicle being a road hazard and Hewes not having a valid Drivers License. PROCESSING:  At the Barrack, Hewes was advised his Miranda Rights at 1904 hours, Hewes waived his rights. Hewes was then provided with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, an MVA English recording of the DR-15 was played for Hewes. During the recording Hewes asked if I can stop the audio because hes already been through the process and just wants to go home. After the DR-15 audio recording, I explained the form to him. Hewes agreed to the Intoximeter Breath Test at approximately 1924 hours. Hewes signed the DR-15 stating he was agreeing to take the Intoximeter Breath Test while stating that he doubts that hes double the legal limit at .15 BrAC.  While waiting for the Intoximeter Breath Test, Hewes stated he had a couple alcoholic shots and beers prior to driving. He advised he had left his house to come to Annapolis with a friend named Celeste and arrived at the Truxton Docks in Annapolis. He advised they had both been out in the water while having some alcoholic beverages prior to meeting other people that were on a boat. Hewes advised they later joined the other people on the boat prior to an argument. Celeste then left him for the other people on the boat causing an argument which resulted in Hewes leaving back to his vehicle prior to driving resulting in our incident. Hewes advised he knew he should not have been driving but was upset due to his friend Celeste leaving him for the day.  At approximately 1953 hours, Sgt. Watson #5509 administered the Intoximeter Breath Test for Hewes. Hewes provided a sufficient sample on his first breath with a result of .19 BrAC. Sgt. Watson requested a second breath sample, Hewes paced back and forth in the Intoximeter Room and decided to not provide another sample. A third chance was given to Hewes, I advised Hewes once the Intoximeter Instrument times out for the third chance. The Intoximeter Breath Test will result in a refusal, Hewes advised I dont give a Fuck man. Hewes failed to provide another sufficient sample resulting in a refusal.  I completed the DR-15A, Officers Certification and Order of Suspension #AJW02052 for Hewes, a temporary license was not issued to Hewes due to his licenses status. I completed a Probable Cause Statement for Hewes and transported him to Jennifer Road Detention Center at approximately 2117 hours. Hewes was provided a copy of all paperwork and traffic citations along with an explanation and released to the custody of Jennifer Road Detention Center.   The suspected Cannabis was packaged and logged on Property Record Form P-334051 in accordance with Maryland State Police policy and procedure. The above-stated CDS was identified through my training, knowledge and experience obtained through multiple hours of drug enforcement training at the Maryland State Police Academy. Civil Citation Number: 2Z46642514  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.   </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>This stop was audibly and visually recorded on my Axon Body Worn Camera and on the Axon Digital Video Camera System installed in Maryland State Police unit, J15.  SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:   On 05/24/2023, at approximately 1825 hours, TFC S. Yu #7292 and I, S/TPR S. Matthews #5973, responded to spur from westbound U.S. Route 50 to northbound Interstate 97, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, for a report of a driver unconscious in the drivers seat of a white Ford F150, stopped in the roadway. Upon our arrival to the area, at approximately 1827 hours, I observed a white Ford F150, pulling a SeaDoo on a jet ski trailer stopped in Lane 2 of the spur from westbound U.S. Route 50 to northbound Interstate 97. The Ford was bearing Maryland registration, 2EV1156. TFC Yu made contact with the driver, later identified as Brendan Matthew Hewes, W/M, DOB: 05/12/1995, at the drivers side window of the Ford. I observed Hewes sitting in the passengers seat of the truck. He was wearing a green baseball cap, backwards; he was shirtless, and wearing black swim trunks. Hewes appeared tired and his eyes were droopy. His eyes appeared watery and bloodshot. Hewes was the sole occupant of the vehicle. Anne Arundel County EMS arrived on scene as well to evaluate Hewes. TFC Yu had Hewes get out of the drivers seat. Hewes slowly slid out of the drivers seat. TFC Yu escorted Hewes to the left shoulder so that EMS could evaluate his condition. Hewes also had a laceration on the cleft of his upper lip, which was slowly bleeding. I got in to move the Ford and SeaDoo trailer out of the roadway to the left shoulder. I observed two open White Claw Hard Seltzer beverages in the center console in plain view. I observed a multicolored glass smoking device in the center console with suspected burnt Cannabis residue in the bowl and a brown, partially burnt suspected Cannabis cigarette with the glass smoking device. The white and purple can, in the front upholder, felt and appeared approximately half full of purple seltzer. The white and yellow can of White Claw, in the second upholder, was empty. I also detected the odor of raw and burnt Cannabis in the vehicle as I got into the drivers seat to move it out of the roadway. I pulled the Ford to the left shoulder. I documented the alcoholic beverages and the CDS and CDS Paraphernalia on my Axon Body Worn Camera prior to getting out of the Ford. EMS personnel advised me that Hewes is going to be refusal for medical treatment.    I conducted a query of the vehicle registration and identified Hewes as the registered owner, through METERS/NCIC. Hewes was only issued a Maryland Identification card, and did not possess a valid Drivers License. I made contact with TFC Yu and he advised me that he observed signs of impairment on Hewes.    As TFC Yu was speaking with Hewes, I walked over to them, as they stood on the left shoulder. TFC Yu was requesting that Hewes submit to a series of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs). Hewes stood in front of TFC Yu, and looking away from TFC Yu. Hewes kept his mouth shut and avoided speaking with TFC Yu verbally. Hewes shook his head left and right, nonverbally declining to submit to the SFSTs. Hewes did not submit to the SFSTs.    TFC Yu placed Hewes under arrest for suspicion of Driving Under The Influence Of Alcohol, at approximately 1836 hours.     As TFC Yu was securing Hewes in handcuffs, I asked him if he needed anything out of his car. He spoke with heavily slurred speech, Nope, not that I know of. I asked Hewes if he had a cell phone. He stated it was in his pocket. As I spoke with Hewes, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath. TFC Yu secured Hewes in the front seat of his patrol car.    TFC Yu went to document the open alcoholic beverages in the vehicle as well as collect the suspected CDS and CDS Paraphernalia as I remained with Hewes. Hewes got my attention and I opened the passengers side door of TFC Yus patrol car to speak with him. The interaction was audibly and visually recorded on my Axon Body Worn Camera. He spoke with heavily slurred speech, Hey man I apologize, does anyone smoke? Does anyone here smoke?. Hewes slurred the word apologize.  I advised him no. I advised him that Marc Bowen Towing was coming to get his truck and trailer. Hewes stated, Awesome, man. I advised him that I would write the tow company information on a card for him. He stated, Thanks so much. Hewes slurred the entire sentence. He also asked with heavy slurred speech, Also do you mind itching my...itching my fuckin nose Hewes stated, Can I ask what happen? I could not understand him because he speech was heavily slurred. He repeated himself, Can I ask what happen? What called you guys to the scene? I advised Hewes that a citizen had stopped out with him and saw him slumped over the wheel. Hewes stated, Awesome. Awesome, thank you so much. Hewes eyes were watery and bloodshot. His speech was slow and heavily to moderately slurred at times as he spoke. I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath as he spoke. Hewes asked me again, Can you please scratch my fuckin nose man, please? with slow drawn speech. I tried to itch his nose for him. I asked Hewes what happened to his face. He slurred, Can I be honest with you...someone got fuckin mad at me cause I asked my girlfriend...arrr...my girlfriend was supposed to ride back with me and I was like, no shes coming with me. And they got mad and threw a fuckin beer can in my face. He stated with slurred speech, My mom gets married on Saturday dude, and I have a split fuckin face, and Im going to jail. The conversation carried on for a few more minutes.    TFC Yu transported Hewes to the Maryland State Police, Annapolis Barracks for processing.    Marc Bowen Towing responded to the scene and took possession of the truck and SeaDoo trailer and towed it from the scene.    This concluded my portion of the investigations.    All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
