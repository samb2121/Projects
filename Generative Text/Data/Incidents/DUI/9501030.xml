The vehicle drove up quickly behind another vehicle in lane 2 until there was less than half a car length between the two vehicles. The Jeep then drove into lane 1, drove quickly forward until it was just in front of the vehicle then quickly and unsafely changed lanes in front of the vehicle causing it to hit the brakes. The Jeep then accelerated at a high rate of speed. I was able to catch up to the vehicle and observe it to be driving 55 MPH in a posted 35 MPH zone. I was able to do this due to me driving at 55 MPH and observing the Jeep to be gaining distance on me so I know the vehicle was traveling at least 55 MPH. As we approached the train bridge in the area of Bridgeview Street, the vehicle drifted over the center line one time causing the driver side tires to go slightly over the center dotted line. Based on all my observations, I activated my emergency equipment and performed a traffic stop in the parking lot at the corner of N/B Rt 13 and Dover St. As I called out the vehicle registration the barrack came back with a response that it was suspended with a pickup tag order as well.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):   I made a driver side approach on the vehicle and contacted the driver, later identified as Lester Lee Rose II (07/30/1981 1/M). I could immediately detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle and could see that his eyes were extremely watery and eyelids heavy. I asked him how much he had to drink tonight and he stated that he had a beer and that was it. I could detect that his speech was slurred slightly, and his speech was slow. Based on my observations I asked him to exit the vehicle to conduct standardized field sobriety.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):   As I asked him to step out of the vehicle he immediately asked to take the breathalyzer test instead of doing the test. I explained to him that he could not do that and he then stepped out of the vehicle. Before asking him any standardized questions he explained to me what the situation was with his suspended registration and as he was talking I could continue to detect that his speech was slurred and slightly slow. I could also now detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breathe when he would speak away from his car. I asked again how much he had to drink and he again just said one beer.  I then asked him the standardized medical questions. I asked if he took any medications to which he said no. I asked if he wore any glasses or contacts to which he said no. I asked if he had any injuries to which he replied with no. Lastly, I asked if there was anything that he would like me to be aware of that would keep him from doing any tests and he stated no.   I explained the first test to Rose which was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: (Clues: 6 of 6)  I explained the test to Rose and asked if he had any questions to which he responded with no. I then performed the test and observed the following clues:  1  Lack of Smooth Pursuit Present in Both Eyes  2  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation Present in Eyes 3  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees Present in Both Eyes  Notes: Rose immediately turned his head after starting the test. After I instructed him not to do that and continued the test, he put his hands up to his cheeks as if to keep his head from moving.   The national standardization of the HGN test has determined that if four or more clues were evident, it is likely the subjects BAC is at or above .10. This criterion is reliable 77% of the time.    WALK AND TURN: (Clues: 5 of 8) The next test performed was the walk and turn test. It was performed on a flat, smooth surface that was well lit by my flashlight and the streetlamps that illuminated the parking lot. A large white line was used for the test. I explained the test to Rose and answered the questions that he had and ensured that he had no more. After I finished answering questions, I performed the test and observed the following clues:  Instructional Phase: 1  Cannot Keep Balance  He had to move his foot to the side to listen to the instructions given.   Walking Phase: 2  Steps Off line  The very first step he took he placed his left foot down outside the line to regain balance. 3  Raises Arms  Raised his arms immediately after starting the test to regain balance. 4  Improper Turn  Turned the wrong way and spun his feet.  5  Stops Walking  Stopped walking after initial set of steps for an extended period of time.   Notes: Rose stopped after the initial set of steps and stated that he could not remember what to do. He asked several questions and asked what to do next. I told him 9 steps back and he was still confused and then began to walk backwards on the line instead of how I instructed him to do earlier. Although he did place his feet to the side several times and he did not take any steps back I did not consider them clues due to him performing the test incorrectly.   The national standardization of the walk and turn test has determined that if two or more clues are evident or the subject could not finish the test, it is likely the subjects BAC is at or above .10. This criterion is reliable 68% of the time. This test combined with four or more clues on the HGN test is reliable 80% of the time.   ONE LEG STAND:  The last standardized test performed was the one Leg Stand Test. I explained the test to him and answered the questions that he had. After I ensured he had no more questions, I performed the test and observed the following clues:  1  Raises Arms 2  Puts Foot Down 3  Sways  Notes: Rose put his foot down around the 10-second mark and continually swayed to his right side while lifting his right arm up.   ADDITIONAL TESTS:  In addition to the standardized sobriety tests I also completed several additional divided attention tests. I first asked him to say the letters F to T without saying anything before or anything after. Rose began at F and stated F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,R,S,T. He said this in a slurred speech and I could continue to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath.   I then asked him to count backwards starting at 59 and ending at 36. He began at 56, counted to 56,54,55,54, then down to 48 which he said twice. He then reached 36 and continued counting down until he reached 30.  I asked Rose on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being sober and 10 being blacked out drunk where he is at and he stated he would not be on a scale.   I then offered Rose the Preliminary Breath Test that he initially asked for to which he agreed. He received a result of .08. He also gave a poor breath sample and was not appropriately blowing as instructed.   ARREST:   Based on the totality of my observations, I placed Rose under arrest for DUI / DWI at approximately 0212 hours. I secured him in my vehicle and retrieved his belongings from his vehicle. As I gathered his belongings, I observed a small bottle of Visine in the center console which would explain why is eyes were extremely watery but not bloodshot during my initial interaction. I reentered my vehicle and the odor of an alcoholic beverage had filled my vehicle that had not been present before placing Rose inside. I then transported Rose to the Maryland State Police Barrack for processing.   I arrived at the barrack and walked Rose inside to perform a secondary search per policy. At this point, Rose had stated multiple times that he was not drunk at all but he did admit that he was speeding. I then brought him to the DUI room where I read him out loud his Dr-15 Advice of rights while also providing him with a physical copy to follow along with. At approximately 0243 hours Rose refused to take the Intoximeter Test.   Rose was polite and respectful throughout my interaction with him. He was later released to a sober driver after being appropriately cited and issued all paperwork.  I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live donors at the Maryland State Police Academy. I have also completed an additional 16 hours of Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training through the Maryland State Police. My training, knowledge, and experience have led to several prior DUI arrests and subsequent convictions.  CASE CLOSED  TFC Todd 6929 </NarrativeText>
