         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM* Title: THOMAS A 23-086. ID: 23-MSP-030201 MVR Statement: The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera. Arrested: Thomas, Christopher Marquise. Certification and training  -Trained in Field Sobriety Test through Maryland State Police Academy.  -Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E)  -Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  - Graduated from The Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies Driving Under the Influence Institute-University of Maryland.  - I am a certified EC/IR II Intoximeter operator.  - I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor.  - I have apprehended more than 240 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On August 27, 2023, at approximately 0411 hours, I, TFC. I. Riba Tankari # 7058 with the Maryland State Police was traveling westbound I-70 east of US-29, Howard County, Maryland in lane #1 (left lane). My issued patrol vehicle is Maryland State Police unmarked unit DUI-6. At that time, I observed a vehicle later found to be a red Lexus IS250 facing the wrong direction with its headlights activated on the ramp from westbound I-70 to southbound US-29 on the right shoulder. I immediately activated my emergency equipment to check on the vehicle. I approached the vehicle and observed the driver (sole occupant) of the vehicle exiting the vehicle from the passenger side and observed the vehicle against the Guardrail with driver side damage. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I made contact with the driver of the vehicle and asked him what happened, and he stated I hit something right there, I dont know what the fuck I hit. I asked the driver where he was coming from, and he stated he was coming from his friends house in Windsor Mill, Maryland. I requested his drivers license and registration card. I observed a clear plastic cup containing an alcoholic beverage in the center console cup holder (see attachments). I observed driver had watery and glassy eyes. While speaking with the driver, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person and noticed his speech was mumbled. The driver was identified through his Maryland drivers license as Thomas, Christopher Marquise. I asked Thomas how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed, and he denied having any alcoholic beverage. I asked Thomas to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, and he agreed.  The evaluation surface was dry, flat, and free of debris. No surface defects were observed. My patrol flashlight and my patrol vehicle and his vehicle headlights lit the area. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Thomas appeared to be in good physical condition. I asked Thomas the following questions: Medical conditions: No. Medications: No. Anything that will prevent you from walking on straight line or standing on one leg: No Glasses or contact: No contacts, wears glasses but not at that moment. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: (6/6 clues observed). The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus - Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Notes: * During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Thomas breath. WALK AND TURN: (6/8 clues observed). The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Thomas stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage: Thomas lost his balance to the right on three separate occasions and to the left on two separate occasions. Thomas started too soon on one occasion. Walking Stage (1st Nine): Raised his arms for balance more than six (6) inches away from his body on all counts. Turn: The turn was not completed correctly; instead Thomas turned to his right failing to take a series of small steps as instructed and demonstrated. Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Stepped completely offline by one shoe width on counts 5 and 7. Raised his arms for balance more than six (6) inches away from his body on all counts. Took ten actual steps when instructed to take 9. One Leg Stand Test (2/4 observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual.

Raised right arm more than six (6) inches from his side for balance. Seconds 11-20: Raised arms more than six (6) inches from his side for balance. Right foot hit ground one time. Seconds 21-30: Raised arms more than six (6) inches from his side for balance. Preliminary Breath Test:  I explained and offered a PBT to Thomas. Thomas elected to consent to the PBT and results were .16 BAC. ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Thomas was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely:  -Driver was involved in a single motor vehicle collision.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from vehicle.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath as he conversed with me.  -Glassy and watery eyes.  -Slow movements  -Observed signs of impairment as he performed the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  - Preliminary Breath Test result of .16 BrAC.  Thomas was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a motor vehicle at 0427 hours and was transported to the Maryland State Police Waterloo Barrack. A search incident to arrest revealed no weapons or contraband. Upon arrival at the Barrack, Thomas was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, and it was read to him from the MVA website in English, and he elected to consent to the Intoximeter EC/IR II test at 0512 hours. 20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Thomas beginning with his arrest. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. He remained in my custody from the time of his arrest. Nothing was introduced to his mouth at any time. The test was conducted by Sgt. Krysiak Intox ID #5199 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument and a result of .16 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath was obtained at 0528 hours. Thomas was polite and cooperative during the encounter. Thomas was given pertinent paperwork, released from the Barrack to his friend pending an appearance in the District Court of Maryland for Howard County at a later date.  All events occurred in Howard County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
