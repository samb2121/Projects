         <NarrativeText>DUI: 23-217 D-34, Marked patrol vehicle equipped with MVR. Defendant: Stamey, Jonathan Christopher DOB: 09/21/1982 License Number: S-350-435-115-731 Date of Arrest: 8/27/2023 Time of crash: 2221 hours Time of Arrest: 2302 hours PBT: Not offered Time on DR-15: 2318 hours Time of Test: 2350 hours Test Result: .18 BAC  This incident was recorded by audio and video. Rear facing in car camera was not functional at the time of this incident. Help desk ticket number 243853 was submitted. Both body worn camera and forward facing in car camera were operational.  Training: Standardized field sobriety testing certified. Advanced roadside impaired driving enforcement (ARIDE) certified.  Narrative: On 8/27/2023 at approximately 2224 hours, I, TFC. Urbano #6588 of the Maryland State Police, currently assigned to the Bel Air Barrack was dispatched to respond to Old Philadelphia Rd at Heathland Trl for a crash with injuries.  I arrived on scene at approximately 2236 hours and observed two vehicles involved in what appeared to be a head on collision. I first made contact with the driver of a Dodge sedan bearing Maryland registration 3FM8936. The driver was identified by Maryland drivers license as Stewart, Kenneth Miles DOB:06/19/1991. Stewart advised he was driving when the other vehicle involved crossed the double yellow line. Stewart was checked by EMS personnel and transported to Harford Memorial with minor injuries.  I then walked over to the other vehicle involved in the crash. The vehicle was a red Tesla Model Y bearing Maryland registration 3FF2454. It was later found that these tags actually belong to a Ford however, after checking the VIN of the Tesla, it showed having a valid registration of 5EL1159. I made contact with Stamey, Jonathan Christopher DOB:09/21/1982. Stamey advised he was driving the vehicle at the time of the crash. Stamey stated he thought he was in the left turn lane however, he was not. Stameys license status showed a status of suspend through MVA. Crash report submitted through DELTA PLUS.  While talking with Stamey I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and or person. Stamey also displayed moderately slurred speech. I asked Stamey if he has had anything to drink tonight. Stamey advised that he had a couple Miller Lites to drink. Stamey further advised he had a total of two drinks over the course of a couple of hours, his last drink being 30 minutes ago.  I asked Stamey if he would be willing to submit to field sobriety testing to determine if he is okay to drive a vehicle. Stamey agreed to the testing. The tests were performed on the side of Old Philadelphia Rd. The surface had a slight crown and was free of debris. I asked Stamey if he takes any medications. Stamey advised he takes 15 Mg of Lexapro once a day. Stamey advised the last time he took Lexapro was two days ago. Stamey advised he has no physical injuries that would affect him driving.  HGN - Six of six clues observed  The first test preformed was the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. During the test, Stameys eyes displayed equal pupil size and equal tracking. Stamey also displayed lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. Stameys eyes also displayed onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.  Walk and turn - Seven of eight clues observed.  I explained and demonstrated how this test should be completed. Stamey was unable to maintain his balance during the instruction phase. Stamey broke the initial heel to toe stance multiple times, using his arms to balance and almost falling over. During this phase of the test, Stamey also started walking too soon.  On Stameys first set of steps, the following clues were observed: - Missed heel to toe on step 1 - Stepped off line on steps 5 and 7 - Uses arms to balance  Stamey performed an improper turn.  On Stameys second set of steps the following clues were observed: - Stopped walking after first step - Uses arms to balance  One leg stand - two of four clues observed.  The third and final test completed was the one leg stand. I explained and demonstrated how the test should be completed. Stamey put his foot down and used his arms to balance.  Stamey was not offered a preliminary breath test.  Due to the above listed clues, Stamey was placed under arrest at 2302 hours. Stamey was read the DR-15 via MVA audio file inside my patrol vehicle.Stamey agreed to submit to a breath test at 2318 hours. Stamey was transported to the Bel Air Barrack where he preformed the breath test.The test was administered by Sgt. Stanley #4849 of the Maryland State Police. Stameys result was .18 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Stamey was polite and cooperative throughout the entire interaction. Stamey was released from the Bel Air Barrack to his son.  Case closed.</NarrativeText>
