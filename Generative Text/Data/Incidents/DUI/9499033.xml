         <NarrativeText>In car camera (G-12) and BWC fully operational at time of incident.  Defendant: John E Cullison III Date of Birth: 03/04/1976 Date of Arrest: 10/02/2023 Time of Arrest: 1900 Pennsylvania DL: 24289354 DUI #: 23-163  Officers Training/Experience * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police.  *Repeat Offender*No  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) Not observed.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  On 10/02/2023 at approximately 1627 hours I responded to the intersection of Taneytown Pike (MD 140) and Hughes Shop Rd for a multi vehicle collision.   Upon my arrival, I observed multiple vehicles that had damage sitting next to the intersection. I had multiple witnesses state the vehicle at fault was a gray Nissan Juke bearing PA registration KEW5710. I observed the driver of the Nissan Juke to be unconscious with medical personnel already on scene providing the driver aid. While the driver of the Nissan Juke was getting worked on by medical personnel, I made contact with the witnesses and other individuals involved in the accident.  Multiple other drivers involved in the collision advised the driver of the Nissan Juke was stopped in the middle of the intersection of Taneytown Pike (MD 140) and Hughes Shop road, blocking traffic, and appeared to be unconscious behind the wheel. Witnesses advised the driver of the Nissan Juke re-gained consciousness all of a sudden and rapidly accelerated, drove up a small grass embankment next to Hughes Shop Rd, came across the opposite lane of traffic, and struck multiple cars that were stopped at the traffic light.  Medical personnel administered Narcan to the driver of the Nissan Juke, who quickly regained consciousness after receiving the Narcan. Narcan is a drug that temporarily stops the effects of an opioid overdose. I was able to positively identify the driver of the Nissan Juke by his Pennsylvania drivers license as, John E Cullison III (W/M DOB: 10/02/2023). Cullison was then transported to Carroll Hospital Center for further treatment. I was not able to speak with Cullison at the scene of the collision due to his condition.    An accident report was for the incident was completed via Delta Plus.   The witness information from the collision is attached to the accident report.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)    Due to the statements made to me by the witnesses, and Cullison needing to be given Narcan to regain consciousness, I suspected Cullison was suffering from an opiod overdose. I then requested a CDS K9 respond to the scene to conduct a scan of Cullisons vehicle.  Corporal DeAngelis #143 and his K9 partner Uri responded to the scene. The K9 performed an open air scan on the exterior of the vehicle, positively alerting to the vehicle. A probable cause search of Cullisions vehicle was conducted which did not reveal any CDS, however, a Narcan nasal spray was found in the vehicles glove box.   Suspecting Cullison was under the influence of CDS at the time of the collision, I responded to the Carroll Hospital Center with an MSP issued blood test kit, to make contact with Cullison. Once at the hospital, I made contact with Cullison. It should be noted that the conversation between Cullison and I was not recorded on body worn camera due to HIPAA regulations inside the hospital.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (0/6 clues observed):   Not performed.  WALK AND TURN (0/8):   Not performed.  ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed):   Not performed.  While at the hospital, I spoke with Cullison who advised he thought another vehicle ran a red light and collided with him in the intersection. I asked Cullison if he recently ingested any controlled dangerous substances, and he advised he ingested multiple Oxycodone tablets prior to driving. I asked Cullison if he has a prescription for them, and he advised he used to, however, it is expired. I asked Cullison if he is supposed to drive after taking his Oxycodone, and he stated, No. I asked Cullison if he thought he was safe to be driving, and he stated, No.   While speaking with Cullison, I observed his body movements to be very slow and lethargic.  ARREST  Based on the following,Ihad reason to believe Cullison was driving a motor vehicle under the influence:  1) Suffering from an apparent drug overdose at the time of the collision. 2) Admission to consuming an opioid (Oxycodone) prior to driving. 3) Slow and lethargic movements. 4) Having to be given Narcan in order to regain consciousness 5) Being at fault in a motor vehicle collision.    Due to my numerous observations, I concluded Cullison had been driving under the influence, and was unable to operate a vehicle safely. While at the hospital, I read Cullison the English version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Cullison refused to submit to a blood kit at approximately 1912 hours. I asked Cullison if he was willing to speak to a drug recognition expert, however, he refused.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ***N/A***  Cullison was charged with Driving Under the Influence of CDS, and given all other appropriate citations related to the motor vehicle collision.  Cullison was left in the custody of the Carroll Hospital Center staff.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
