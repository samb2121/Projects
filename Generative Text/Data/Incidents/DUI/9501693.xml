         <NarrativeText>                                                  Maryland State Police-Salisbury Barrack E MSP unmarked vehicle V-11 is equipped with a mobile recording device.     Defendant: Jacob Dallas Tingle Drivers license #: MD-10274403570 Date of Arrest: 11/17/2023 Time of Arrest: 1716 hours DUI #: 23-54-228 PBT Results: Not offered Blood kit results: Pending   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING   -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. -Trained ARIDE test through the Maryland State Police. -Completed certified SFST instructor class.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 11/17/2023 at approximately 1702 hours, I, Trooper First Class C. Shubert #7062 with the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack, was on-duty working the paving detail for US Route 13, operating unmarked patrol vehicle V-11 in the area of US Route 13 and Clyde Avenue, Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland 21826. At that time, I was stationary on the southbound side of US Route 13 with my emergency equipment activated for traffic control. I then observed a white Ford F250 bearing Delaware (CL19848) that was leaving Adams Tap house Grille parking lot doing a burnout/spinning tires while leaving. The vehicle then traveled northbound on US Route 13. The vehicle later made a right turn onto E Cedar Lane. Due to the vehicles behavior, I then activated my emergency equipment and attempted to catch up to the vehicle and left my traffic detail. The vehicle then went around the round. While the vehicle was traveling around the round about the vehicle slowed down and then quickly accelerated onto N Division Street. The vehicle then was following the vehicle in front of it closer than a car length. After approximately ten (10) seconds the vehicle eventually stopped on N Division near Hunters Way where the traffic stop was conducted.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the driver. I advised the driver why he was being stopped. While speaking with the driver, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. The drivers speech was slurred and eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I identified the driver as Jacob Dallas Tingle through his Maryland license. I asked Tingle how many alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving to which he advised; A few drinks. I then asked Tingle how long he was at Adams Tape house Grille, and he advised; A few hours. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine MVA checks on Tingle. I later returned to Tingles vehicle and asked him to step out and to walk to the front of his vehicle. Tingle complied. At the front of his vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Tingles breath and person. Tingle freely stated:I have a buzz, I know I smell like alcohol. I then asked him what type of alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving to which he advised:A couple of Coronas.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on N Division Street where the vehicle made a complete stop. The surface was flat and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 68 degrees. Lighting conditions were dusk hours, flashlight, vehicle headlights. My forward emergency equipment was deactivated during all testing. Tingle appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injury.   I asked Tingle the following pre-testing questions:   1. Injuries: Possibly a lazy eye but has good vision. 2. Glasses: NO 3. Medications:NO  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6 of 6 clues observed)   1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes. 2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes. ***VGN was present***   WALK AND TURN (3 of 8 clues observed) Tingle was argumentative throughout the demonstration process.   Walking Stage (1st Nine) Counting in Spanish    Took ten (10) steps instead of nine (9) as demonstrated     Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Counting in Spanish      1. Stepped off of the line on step 2.  2. Took eleven (11) steps instead of nine steps as demonstrated.     margin-left:8px"&gt;Stopped walking after step 6 and couldnt remember what number he was counting in Spanish.     Tingle then became argumentative again while I was demonstrated the one leg stand test. Tingle began to yell and try to argue about the test he conducted. Tingle eventually started walking back to his driver side of his vehicle stated; I passed the test. Im calling my lawyer.   ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Tingle was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  * Spinning tires. * Aggressive driving. * Following vehicle too close. * Failing to stay within lane of travel. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.   At approximately 1716 hours, I placed Tingle under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I placed Tingle in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. Tingle continued to be argumentative and did not listen to a single thing I was trying to explain to him. While still on-scene, I played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Tingle via the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) official website. Tingle did not listen to the DR-15 form and continued to be argumentative. At the conclusion of the audio version of the DR-15 form, I verbally repeated and reviewed the possible suspensions and sanctions that can be imposed by the MVA to Tingles driving privilege. Tingle stated two or three times; How would you feel if I put a gun in my mouth and kill myself after you drop me off, how would you feel. Tingle then was stated suicidal statements and was advised he would be going to Tidal Health for an emergency petition evaluation, and he would be taking the blood kit test at the hospital. Tingle submitted to the blood kit test and signed the same at approximately 1737 hours.   TRANSPORT   Tingle was subsequently transported to Tidal Health for further processing. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Tingle continued to be strong and Tingle continued to be argumentative.   Blood kit test results: Pending  RN Melissa K administered the blood kit test at approximately 1819 hours. The blood kit was packaged per MSP policy.   RELEASE   Tingle was released to the hospital staff at approximately 1830 hours. Photographs of Tingles tire tracks from his spinning his wheels leaving Adams tape house Grille were captured and attached to the report.   CHARGES   Tingle was charged with the following:  1. Driving vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (6BH0UR8) 2. Driving vehicle while impaired by alcohol (6BG0UR8) 3. Reckless driving vehicle in wanton and willful disregard for safety of person and property (6BF0UR8) 4. Driver spinning wheels (6BD0UR8) 5. Driver of motor vehicle following vehicle closer than reasonable and prudent.   I request this case to remain open pending blood kit results.  All events occurred in Wicomico County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
