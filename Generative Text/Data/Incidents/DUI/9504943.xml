         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on my Maryland State Police issued BWC and MSP marked T-31 front and passenger in-car camera.  SCENE PROCESSING:   I captured two (2) photographs of three (3) empty alcohol miniatures on the front passengers side floor board. The photographs were uploaded to this report.    Defendant: Stephen Joseph Redding   Date of Birth: 07/11/1963   Date of Arrest: 06/20/2023   Time of Arrest: 1520 hours   MD DL# R-352-777-441-549   DUI: 23-068  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On June 20, 2023, at approximately 1502 hours, I was on duty, in full uniform, operating MSP Marked (T-31). While on routine patrol, I was monitoring traffic heading northbound on Maryland Route 235 south of Hugh Dr, Hollywood, Maryland. An electric company was working on the electric line with their vehicles parked on the right shoulder. The electric company also had their yellow flashers activated and a roadwork sign behind them to indicated they were working. While monitoring traffic, I observed a white passenger vehicle, in lane #2, failed to move over to lane #1 as required by law. It also should be noted the white passenger vehicle was the only vehicle on the roadway at the time of the violation. I positioned my patrol vehicle behind the white passenger vehicle, activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on a white Toyota Corolla bearing Maryland registration 7AX6454 on the left shoulder of Jones Wharf Road just north of Three Notch Road, Hollywood, Maryland.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I approached the drivers side of the Toyota Corolla, and made contact with a white male driver who was wearing a white tee shirt, black and gray pajama pants and brown slippers. The white male driver was the operator/sole occupant. I explained to the operator the reason for the traffic stop. The operator was confused on the traffic stop and at one point stated, I did not see any workers on the shoulder. After explaining the reason for the traffic stop, I asked the operator for his license and registration. While talking to the driver, he seemed very lethargic. The operator provided his drivers license and was identified as Stephen Joseph Redding (W/M DOB: 07/11/1963). While talking to Redding, I smelled the odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle and his breath. I observed Redding eyes to be glossy. I asked Redding how many alcoholic beverages did he consumed prior to the traffic stop. Redding advised he had one (1) wine glass at Olive Garden three hours ago.   I requested Redding to step out of his vehicle and walk to the front of his vehicle. As I continued to talk to Redding, I continued to smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I continued to observe Reddings eyes to be glossy. Redding again advised he only had one wine glass at Olive Garden three hours prior to the traffic stop. I informed Redding that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The tests were performed on the right shoulder of Jones Wharf Road north of Three Notch Road, Hollywood, MD The surface was dry, level and free from debris. My patrol vehicles emergency equipment and spotlight were deactivated during all three (3) tests.   I asked Redding the following questions:  Contacts or Glasses: None  Medical Condition: None  Injuries: None  Medication: None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED)   The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as a tests stimulus and held approximately 12-15 inches from Reddings eyes. Redding was instructed to look straight ahead, keep his head still while focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Redding pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Redding was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not hinder his ability to complete the test.   Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset Nystagmus Prior to 45 degrees  Present in both eyes.  Vertical Nystagmus - Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 CLUES OBSERVED)   Prior to Redding performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Redding was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot touching heel to toe on an imaginary line with his hands by his sides. Redding was instructed to remain in that position until told to begin. Redding was advised to take nine (9) heels to toe steps in a straight line. Redding was instructed to keep his hands at his sides, eyes focused on his feet and count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Redding was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot planted, and take a series of small steps around his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Redding was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) heel to toe steps were to be performed identical to the first series minus the turn. Redding was instructed once he began the test, he was not to stop walking until he completed the test. I asked Redding if he understood the test directions that were given and demonstrated in which he stated, Yes.    Instructional Stage:    Cannot maintain balance   Start too soon  WALKING STAGE (1ST NINE)    Missed Heel to Toe by more than half inch on all nine (9) steps.   Stepped off-line on step all nine (9) steps.   Arm raised more than six (6) inches.    Redding took twenty-one (21) steps instead of the nine (9) that was instructed.   Note: While doing this portion of the test, Redding almost fell over multiple times.   WALKING STAGE (2ND Nine)    After Redding took twenty-one steps, he advised he was completed this portion of the test. Redding did not complete this portion of the test in Its entirely as instructed.   WALK AND TURN (3/4 CLUES OBSERVED)   Prior to Redding performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Redding was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice approximately six (6) inches from the ground. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot and count out loud by thousands and continue the test until instructed to stop. Redding was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes. Redding did not raise either foot.   Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10  Did not complete  Seconds 10-20  Did not complete  Seconds 20-30  Did not complete  Note: Once the instruction phase was completed for the One Leg Stand Test, Redding advised he understood the direction that were given. Redding began walking and counting his steps out loud. Redding had a hard time walking. Redding did not complete this portion of the test as instructed. Redding was very lethargic and not understand what was going on.   While on scene, Redding was offered a Preliminary Breath Test (P.B.T). Redding took the test with the results of .15 BrAC.  ARREST:   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Jones was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   Odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath.  Redding admitting to consuming an alcoholic beverage.   Reddings eyes were glossy.  Redding exhibited numerous clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.    I concluded Redding was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 1520 hours, I placed Redding under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. A search of Redding was conducted on scene and revealed that he did not have anything in his mouth. Redding was placed in the front passenger seat per policy. Redding was transported to the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack. When I arrived at the barrack, Redding was provided a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights and was instructed to follow along with me while I read it out loud to him. While continuing to talk to Redding, I continued to smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Reddings breath and person. I continue to observed Redding eyes to be glossy. At approximately 1547 hours, I finished reading the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Redding stated he understood what was read to him and agreed to take the intoximeter test.   Sgt. Oles from the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack administered the intoximeter test at approximately 1554 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULTS *******.12 BrAC*******   Redding was cooperative during this incident. Redding was provided all the proper paper work and released to a sober driver.    Case closed by arrest.  All the above listed events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
