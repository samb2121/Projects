         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM*  The following incident was captured on in-car camera. Title: DUI 23-069 R. ID: 23-MSP-004227.  Case #: 23-MSP-004227 DUI #: 23-069 (Golden Ring Barrack) Defendant: Paul Nixon Huber   TRAINING: *I am trained by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. *I am approved by the State of Maryland Office of Chief Medical Examiner and Maryland State Police to conduct preliminary breath tests. *I have successfully completed the Instructor Development Course in Standardized Field Sobriety Testing by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *I have successfully completed and graduated with distinction from the 15th session of the University of Marylands Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies (DUI Institute.) *I have successfully completed the Instructor Development Course in Preliminary Breath Tests by the Maryland State Police. *I have successfully completed the Basic Breath Test Operator Course. *I attended the Impaired Driving Conference, October 2018. *I have successfully completed a 24-hour NHTSA course in Moving/Stationary Doppler RADAR and LIDAR through the Baltimore County Police Department, June 2019. *I attended the Robert F. Borkenstein Course on Alcohol and Highway Safety in Bloomington, IN. December 2022. *I have apprehended more than 450 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE ONE): On February 2, 2023 at approximately 2246 hours, I, Trooper First Class Jackson #6481, was conducting moving RADAR in Maryland State Police unmarked unit DUI-6. While on Bowleys Quarters Road prior to Susquehanna Ave in Baltimore County, Maryland, I observed a gray GMC Sierra (MD: 1BV2592) directly in front of my patrol vehicle. I observed the operator fail to remain right of center. I observed the operator swerve the truck to the left, over the double yellow lane lines and into the oncoming traffic lane by more than half the trucks width.  I observed the operator of the truck accelerate to, what appeared to be, a high rate of speed. With my patrol vehicles Kustom Signals Golden Eagle II RADAR set activated, the vehicle entered my RADARs field of influence at 46 MPH in a clearly posted 30 MPH speed zone. The Radar was tested before and after the stop and found to be working properly.  I observed the operator again swerve the truck to the left, over the double yellow lane lines, and into the oncoming traffic lane by more than the width of the drivers side tires. Based on these observations, I felt the truck was being operated in an unsafe and negligent manner and needed to be stopped for the safety of other motorists on the roadway. I activated my emergency lights and observed the operator come to a stop in a parking lot.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE TWO): I contacted the driver and sole occupant of the truck. I identified myself and the reasons for the traffic stop. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within the vehicle. I identified the driver by his Maryland drivers license as Paul Nixon Huber. I observed Hubers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Huber stated that he dropped his cigarettes and he was trying to pick them up. Huber stated that he was driving home from his girlfriends house.  I returned to my patrol vehicle where I conducted a license check on Huber. I deactivated my front emergency lights and made my second approach on the drivers side. I asked Huber to exit his vehicle in order to separate him from the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within.  While outside of the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Hubers breath and person. Huber admitted to consuming three Jack Daniels and coke prior to driving. Huber stated that he consumed the drinks while watching Top Gun Maverick. I observed Hubers speech was slow and thick. Based on my observations of Huber, I asked him to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE THREE): I conducted the evaluation in a well-lit parking lot. The area appeared to be level, dry, and free of any obvious debris. Huber appeared to be in good physical condition.  I asked Huber the following questions: Glasses or contact: Wearing prescription glasses. Medications: Three high blood pressure medications and two diabetes medication. 100 mg Zoloft taken in the morning. Physical or mental injuries: No. Medical conditions: Anxiety and high blood pressure. Huber explained that he is a newly diagnosed Diabetic.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): 6/6 CLUES OBSERVED. I instructed Huber to stand with his heels and toes together and his arms flat down at his sides. I then properly explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Huber and he stated he understood. I positioned Huber in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test. Hubers pupils were equal in size, resting nystagmus was not present, and his eyes showed equal tracking.  1.) Lack of smooth pursuit- Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes. 4.) Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Not present.  NOTE: During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Hubers breath.  WALK AND TURN (WAT): 3/8 CLUES OBSERVED. I instructed Huber to stand in the instructional position, with his right foot in front of his left foot, touching heel to toe, in a straight line, with his hands flat down at his sides. I instructed Huber to remain in that position until I tell him to begin the test and he stated he understood. I then demonstrated and explained the Walk and Turn to Huber in accordance with the NHTSA manual. Huber stated that he understood.  Instructional Phase: During the instructional phase, I observed Huber put his thumbs in his pocket when he was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides. Prior to starting the test I instructed Huber to place his hands flat at his sides.  Walking Stage (1st nine): 1.) Huber missed touching heel to toe by more than one inch on step 5.  Turn: Huber did not perform the turn as instructed. After turning, I observed Huber put his thumbs back into his pockets.  Walking Stage (2nd nine): 1.) Huber missed touching heel to toe by more than three inches on steps 6, 7, 8 and 9. 2.) Huber stepped off line on step 8 causing him to cross his feet. NOTE: During the test, Huber stepped on the toe of his shoe multiple times causing him to stumble forward.  ONE LEG STAND (OLS): 4/4 CLUES OBSERVED. I instructed Huber to stand with his heels and toes together and his arms flat down at his sides. I then demonstrated and explained the One Leg Stand to Huber in accordance with the NHTSA manual. Huber stated that he understood. Huber chose to raise his right foot.  Instructional Stage: Nothing observed.  Balance and Count Stage:  1.) Huber put his foot down three times. 2.) Huber swayed from side to side for balance seven times. 3.) Huber raised both of his arms by more than one foot for balance three times. 4.) Huber hopped on his left foot for balance two times.  Preliminary Breath Test (PBT): I offered Huber a Preliminary Breath Test, which he agreed. Result: 0.13 BrAC.  While awaiting the PBT results I asked Huber how many alcoholic drinks he consumed prior to driving and he stated, Three or four Jacks and Cokes in the last three hours. Huber stated that his girlfriend mixed the drinks, so he was unaware of the amount of Jack Daniels in each drink.  ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Huber was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2303 hours, I placed Huber under arrest for driving while under the influence. Search incident to arrest revealed no contraband on Hubers person. I placed Huber in the front passenger seat per department policy.  I transported Huber to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing. While at the Barrack, I provided Huber with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. I then played the DR-15 Advice of Rights audio aloud and instructed Huber to follow along. At approximately 2339 hours, Huber agreed to submit to an alcohol concentration test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Huber beginning with his arrest. I conducted a preliminary search of Huber on scene and it revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. I observed Huber from the time of arrest until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. SGT Taylor, Operator #5494, conducted the test on a certified instrument. Huber had a result of 0.12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 2349 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT:  ****0.12 grams of alcohol****  I issued Huber citations, copies of the DR-15, DR-15A, and MSP 33. Huber was cooperative throughout the incident and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
