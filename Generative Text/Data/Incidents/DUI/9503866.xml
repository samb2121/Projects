         <NarrativeText>THIS INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED BY MOBILE VIDEO RECORDER AND BODYWORN CAMERA (MSP MARKED VEHICLE J-10 MVR EQUIPMENT FUNCTIONAL.)  DWI 23-019  Suspect Information: Wilmer Ismael Romero Diaz, DOB 10/28/1996 Address: 8133 15th Ave Apartment 4 Hyattsville, Maryland 20783 Maryland Drivers License: MD-10273253194  Training Certificates:   Trained in administering standardized field sobriety test through Maryland State Police.  NHSTA certified to conduct field sobriety (SFST)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE)   Narrative:  Call For Service:  On 01/28/2023 at approximately 0729 Hours, I Tpr. Fuller #7354 of the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack was dispatched to a single vehicle collision in the area of eastbound route 50 at South Haven Road. When I arrived on scene, I noticed a silver Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration 2EJ9641 on the right shoulder with damage all around the vehicle. Upon my arrival, witnesses on the scene advised that the occupants of the vehicle fled on foot. I canvased the immediate area, no occupants of the vehicle were located. While checking the vehicle for occupants, I detected the odor of alcohol emitting from the vehicle. I noticed multiple cases and empty bottles of Corona Extra alcoholic beverages to be scattered all around the interior of the vehicle. TFC. Hitch #7051 made contact with a bystander who witnessed the single vehicle collision. The bystander was identified by their Maryland drivers license (C-516-139-398-361) to be Denise Jennifer Cumberland (W/F DOB 05/12/1971). Ms Cumberland said she saw a silver sedan lose control and swerve from the left lane to the right shoulder hitting a light pole after spinning around. I then observed three (Mexican male) passengers climb out of the rear window of the vehicle. When the emergency vehicle approached the three males left on foot into the woods. Personal Contact:  TFC. Hitch #7051 and TFC. Tyler #6787 made contact with four Hispanic Males matching the description given by the witness, walking down South Haven Road at 2nd Street Annapolis, Maryland 21401. While on scene TFC. Tyler requested a Spanish speaking officer and none were available to respond to the scene from Anne Arundel County Police, Annapolis City Police, and Maryland Department of Transportation Authority (MDTA). However, a non spanish speaking Anne Arundel County Police officer arrived. I cleared the accident scene and started to TFC. Hitch and TFC. Tylers location. I made contact with driver of the vehicle who was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Wilmer Ismael Romero Diaz (H/M DOB 10/28/1996). When contact was made with Wilmer I observed car keys to be in his left pocket as well as the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I also observed his eyes to be bloodshot red and glassy. Wilmer was detained for suspicions of driving under the influence of alcohol and transported to the Maryland State Police Annapolis barrack to perform a standardized field sobriety test.  Pre-Arrest Screening:  On arrival at the Maryland State Police barrack. I called the Language Line Solution Hotline number for translation purposes due to no Spanish speaking Officers being available at the time. Adriana ID Number 405509 answer the phone and translated in Spanish.The tests surface was dry, level and free of debris. Before administering the Standard Field Sobriety Test, I asked Wilmer if he had any injuries that would prevent him from completing the tests correctly. I asked Wilmer the following questions: Medical Conditions  No Injuries  No Medication  No Glasses or Contacts  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Wilmers eyes. Wilmer was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Wilmers pupils were equal in size and had equal tracking.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes   margin-left:8px"&gt;Vertical Nystagmus  Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (5/8)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per NHTSA SFST Manual. Wilmer was asked if he understood and if he had any questions. Wilmer said he understood and had no questions. Instructional Stage:     Cannot Keep Balance  Unable to stay in instructional position as told   margin-left:8px"&gt;Starts too soon  Walking Stage (1st Nine) Completed satisfactory  Turn:  Not performed as instructed  Walking Stage (2nd Nine)     Misses heel-toe on step two.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Steps off line on step two   One Leg Stand (0/4) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per NHTSA SFST Manual. Wilmer was asked if he understood and if he had any questions. Wilmer said he understood and had no questions.  Preliminary Breath Test: Not Offered  Arrest:  Based on my training, knowledge, and experience acquired from the Maryland State Police and prior DUI arrests, I placed Wilmer under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0919 hours. I administer the 20 minute observation period. During the 20 minute observation period, I did not observe Wilmer belch, regurgitate or ingest anything. At 0945 hours DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to Wilmer utilizing the MVA Spanish audio recording. Wilmer agreed and submitted to a chemical breathalyzer. BaC tests results showed that Wilmer breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of 0.18 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Wilmer was charged appropriately for Driving Under The Influence of Alcohol.  Disposition: Wilmer was charged with DUI and released to Yenner Aroldo Miranda Mendez H/M DOB 09/10/1992  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County Maryland. Case Closed By Arrest </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured by my body camera.  On 1/28/2023 at approximately 0729 hours, I TFC. Tyler of the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack assisted TPR. Fuller on a single vehicle accident E/B RT. 50 at South Haven Rd. When I arrived on the scene I was advised by the Anne Arundel County Police Officers on the scene that the driver and passengers of the vehicle had fled the scene on foot into the woods. Myself and County Police Officers searched the woods for those individuals but were unable to locate them. I was advised by the County Officer that it was four individuals and that one of them only had on a shirt and jeans. TFC. Hitch and I checked the surrounding area within close proximity to the collision scene for those individuals. TFC. Hitch located them on South Haven Road at 2nd Street walking down the sidewalk.  I joined TFC. Hitch in interviewing the individuals. They all advised that they needed a Spanish speaking interpreter to communicate with us. With the assistance of Annapolis City Officer Paralda who was called by the Anne Arundel County Officer, we were able to get the information needed to confirm they were the individuals involved in the collision. The owner of the vehicle that was involved in the collision was among the individuals walking away from the collision. The owner/driver was identified as Wilmer Ismael Romero-Diaz H/M DOB 10/28/1996 of Hyattsville, MD Romero-Diaz advised that he was the driver of the vehicle involved in the collision and will take full responsibility for the situation and damages. While speaking with Romero-Diaz, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. His eyes were glassy and bloodshot as well. I advised TPR. Fuller of what we discovered and he took over the scene from there.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, MD.  </NarrativeText>
