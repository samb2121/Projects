         <NarrativeText>L-8 is equipped with a mobile recording device, this incident was recorded. This incident was also recorded with my body-worn camera.  Defendant: Edgar Daniel Guzman Date of Birth: 07/04/1999 Date of Arrest: 04/26/2023 Time of Arrest: 0108 hours MD License #: G-255-172-135-528 DUI #: 23-131  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES      Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on December 5th-8th, 2022.      Trained in administering Preliminary Breath Tests through the Maryland State Police Forensics Science Division on December 9, 2022.     Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1):  On April 26, 2023 at approximately 0056 hours, I, Trooper Stacey #7390 of the Maryland State Police Forestville Barracks was running stationary LiDAR serial #LF04533 in the area of Maryland Route 4 and Woodyard Road, Prince Georges County, Maryland, when I observed a dark green Cadillac Escalade in lane #2 traveling at a high rate of speed. I pointed my LiDAR unit at the front of the green Escalade and obtained a reading of 93 mph in a posted 55 mph zone at an unknown distance due to my LiDAR system shutting down before obtaining the distance. The green escalate was bearing Maryland registration 1FD1901. At this time I initiated a traffic stop on this vehicle at Maryland Route 4 at Dowerhouse Road. The vehicle took an extremely long time to pull over. Once the vehicle pulled over, both right side tires went into the ditch.  Personal Contact (Phase 2): On my initial drivers side approach of the vehicle, I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. The driver who I later identified as Edgar Daniel Guzman (H/M, DOB: 07/04/1999) by his Maryland Drivers License appeared to be very paranoid and nervous. Guzmans eyes were glassy and bloodshot, and he was slurring his speech. When attempting to grab his registration card he just pointed at the glove compartment and wouldnt grab it. I asked Guzman what year his car was, and he stated 2016, I waited a few seconds and asked him the same question, and he said 2015. At this time Guzman was asked if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages, and he said he had one cup of vodka. I then asked Guzman to exit the vehicle for Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Once Guzman exited the vehicle I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3): The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of the highway. The weather was clear 50 degrees. Lighting conditions were dark. The ground was level and free of any debris. My patrol vehicles overhead emergency lights in the front were deactivated prior to field sobriety tests as well as the vehicles spotlight. Guzman was wearing flat heeled shoes at the time of the evaluation.  I asked Guzman the following questions: Medical Conditions: None Glasses or contacts: No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from his eyes. Guzman was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Guzmans pupils were of equal size and showed equal tracking.  Guzman displayed the following clues:    Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes   WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) Prior toGuzman performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Guzman was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary line.Guzman was instructed and demonstrated to place hishands flat at hissides and to remain in that position until told to begin.Guzman was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Guzman was instructed to keep hishands flat at hersides, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Guzman was explained and demonstrated to keep hislead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with hisrear foot to the left to turn completely around.Guzman was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Guzman was instructed that once she began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hissides, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud.  Instructional Stage:    Cannot keep balance during instruction  Starts too soon   Walking Stage (1st set of nine steps):    Does not touch heel to toe for any of the 9 steps  Steps off line in between steps 2 and 3  Uses arms for balance  Stops the test   Walking Stage (2nd set of nine steps):    Does not touch heel to toe for any of the 9 steps  Uses arms for balance   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)  Prior to Guzman performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to stand with his feettogether and hands down by his side while the instructions were given. During the test he was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start, once the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop.  Guzman displayed the following clues:  Raises arms for balance: 0 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 30  Foot down: 0 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 30  Sways: 0 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 30  Guzman was offered a Preliminary Breath Test to which he refused.   ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Guzman was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle and his breath  Eyes glassy and bloodshot  Clues observed during field sobriety  Admission of consuming alcoholic beverages    Guzman was arrested at 0108 hours. Guzman was transported to the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack. At approximately 0116 hours, Guzman was read the DR15 which was played from the MVA website. Guzman refused to take the intoximeter examination test at 0126 hours. Guzman was given the appropriate citations and was released to his parents at 0155 hours.  All of the above events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.    </NarrativeText>
