         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police-Berlin Barrack V MSP marked vehicle V-11 is equipped with a mobile recording device.  Defendant: David Allen Moore Jr Identification Card #: MD-10272763708 Date of Arrest: 4/15/2023 Time of Arrest: 0035 hours DUI #: 23-96-087 PBT Results: .17 Intoximeter Results: Refusal   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING   -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. -Trained in ARIDE test through the Maryland State Police. -Certified SFST instructor.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 04/15/2023 at approximately 0017 hours, I, Trooper First Class C. Shubert #7062 with the Maryland State Police was on-duty and operating unmarked patrol vehicle V-11 in the area of US Route 50 westbound and Riddle Lane (Berlin). At that time, I observed a blue Chevy S10 bearing Delaware registration (CL60197) that was traveling westbound in lane two. While following the vehicle, I observed the driver unrestrained by his seatbelt. I also observed the vehicle cross the right shoulder line by a tire width four (4) times. I activated the emergency equipment to my patrol vehicle and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle made a right turn onto MD Route The vehicle made a complete stop on the right shoulder area.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver and passenger. I advised the driver why he was being stopped. While speaking with the driver, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. The drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and his speech slurred. I asked the driver for his license and registration. The driver advised he did not have a license. The driver eventually handed me his identification card. I identified him as David Allen Moore Jr through his Maryland identification card. I asked the driver where he was coming from, to which he advised:Ocean City. I then asked him how many alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving to which he advised:Nothing. As I was talking to the driver, I continued to hear slurred speech. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine MVA checks on Moore. I later returned to Moores vehicle and asked him to step out and to walk to the front of his vehicle. Moore complied. While at the front of his vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Moores breath and person and continued to hear slurred speech. I asked Moore when was the last time he had consumed an alcoholic beverage, to which he advised: Like ten (10) minutes ago, Jack and Coke. I then asked Moore how many total alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving, to which he advised:Like two (2). I then asked Moore where he consumed the alcoholic beverages at, he then stated he could not remember.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on MD Route 589. The surface was flat and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 71 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight, vehicle headlights, and parking lot lighting. My forward emergency equipment was deactivated during all testing. Moore appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injury.   I asked Moore the following pre-testing questions:   1. Injuries: Bad right shoulder and bad right knee from a car accident. 2. Contacts: NO 3. Medications: Smoked Marijuana five (5) minutes ago prior to the traffic stop.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6 of 6 clues observed)   1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes. 2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes.   WALK AND TURN (Moore advised to skip the test due to hip issue)     ONE LEG STAND (Moore advised to skip the test)    ADDITIONAL TESTING ALPHABET TEST   1). I asked Moore if he knew the English alphabet, to which he advised: Yes. I instructed Moore to recite from the letter H to the letter T. Moore started at the letter H and stopped at the letter V,which was contrary to my instructions.   PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST   I offered Moore the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test, and Moore consented to the preliminary breath test with the result of .17 BrAC.   ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Moore was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   * Crossing the right shoulder line four (4) times * Unrestrained by his seatbelt * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Slurred speech. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.   At approximately 0035 hours, I placed Moore under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I checked Moores mouth for any foreign objects and none were found. I placed Moore in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. While still on-scene, I played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Moore via the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) official website. At the conclusion of the audio version of the DR-15 form, I verbally repeated and reviewed the possible suspensions and sanctions that can be imposed by the MVA to Moores driving privilege. Moore refused to submit to a breath test at approximately 0053 hours. Prior to transport, I observed the vehicle registration was expired as of 6/22.   TRANSPORT   Moore was subsequently transported to the Berlin Barrack for processing. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Moore continued to be strong.   RELEASE   Moore was cooperative throughout the process. Moore was released at approximately 0115 hours from the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack.   CHARGES   Moore was charged with the following:  1. Driving vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (5QJ0UR8) 2. Driving vehicle while impaired by alcohol (5QH0UR8) 3. Operator motor vehicle not restrained by seat belt (5QB0UR8) 4. Failure to drive right of center (5QC0UR8) 5.
