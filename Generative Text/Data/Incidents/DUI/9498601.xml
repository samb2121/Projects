         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM* MVR Statement: The following incident was captured on in-car and Body camera. Title: VASQUEZ R23-501. ID: 23-MSP-032497 Arrested: Vasquez Amaya, Porfirio Feliciano. Certification and training  -Trained in Field Sobriety Test through Maryland State Police Academy.  -Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E)  -Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  - Graduated from The Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies Driving Under the Influence Institute-University of Maryland.  - I am a certified EC/IR II Intoximeter operator.  - I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor.  - I have apprehended more than 250 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On September 16, 2023, at approximately 0016 hours, I, TFC. I. Riba Tankari # 7058 with Maryland State Police was traveling eastbound MD-150 (Eastern Blvd) west of Wilson Point Road, Baltimore County, Maryland in lane #1 (left lane). My issued patrol vehicle is Maryland State Police unmarked unit DUI-6. At that time, I observed a green Ford SUV bearing Maryland registration 1AJ9258 traveling eastbound MD-150 in lane #1 had swerved to the left towards the solid yellow line and struck the curb. I followed the Ford and observed the vehicle was unable to stay within a single and appeared to be traveling under the posted speed limit. I observed the Ford had swerved from lane #1 into lane #2 (right lane) by one tire width on two separate occasions. I observed the Ford had swerved to the right towards the dotted white line and drove on the line on four separate occasions. I continued to follow the Ford and observed the vehicle had swerved from lane #1 into lane #2 by more than one tire width on two separate occasions. I initiated a traffic stop on the Ford using my emergency equipment. The Ford came to a stop in the area of eastbound MD-150 and east of MD-43 (White Marsh Blvd), Baltimore County, Maryland in the left turning lane. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the Ford on the driver side and made contact with the driver (the sole occupant) of the vehicle. I introduced myself and explained to him the reason for the traffic stop and observed an opened can of Modelo beer (half full) in the center console cup holder and I later found two unopened boxes and an empty can of Modelo beer on the front passenger floor mat (see attachments). I asked the driver where he was coming from, and he stated I am coming from the city, I lost my wallet, so I am trying to figure it out where. I asked the driver if he had he drivers license on him, and he stated like I said I just lost my wallet. I then requested his registration card. I asked the driver where he was going, and he stated home. I asked the driver if he is the vehicle registered owner, and he stated yes. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I observed that the driver had glassy and watery eyes. I observed the drivers movements were slow while he was looking for the registration card. The driver was identified through an MVA check of the vehicle registration as Vasquez Amaya, Porfirio Feliciano. I returned to my patrol vehicle and notified the barrack who I was out with. I returned to the Ford and I requested Vasquez to exit his vehicle and he complied. After exiting his vehicle, Vasquez stated he was coming from a nightclub and that his wallet was stolen. While outside his vehicle, I again noticed his movements were slow. I asked Vasquez how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed he stated two or three beers. I asked him what kind of beer, and he stated Modelo. I asked him if they were bottle, cup or can, and he stated bottle. I asked him around what time, and he stated maybe like thirty minutes ago. While speaking with Vasquez outside his vehicle, I again detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I asked Vasquez to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, and he agreed.  The evaluation surface was dry, flat, and free of debris. No surface defects were observed. My patrol flashlight, surrounding lightning, and his vehicle headlights lit the area. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Vasquez appeared to be in good physical conditions. I asked Vasquez the following questions: Medical conditions: No. Medications: No. Anything that will prevent you from walking on straight line or standing on one leg: No. Glasses or contact: No. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: (6/6 clues observed). The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus - Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Notes: * During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Vasquezs breath. WALK AND TURN: (5/8 clues observed). The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Vasquez stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage: Vasquez lost his balance to the right on several occasions and had difficulty staying in the instructional position. Walking Stage (1st Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than half inch on counts 8. Took nineteen actual steps when instructed to take 9. Stepped completely offline by one shoe width on count 1. Notes *After the nineteenth step, I asked Vasquez how many steps he was asked to take, and he stated nine. I asked him how many did he do, and he stated I havent counted. Turn: The turn was not completed correctly; instead Vasquez turned to his right failing to take a series of small steps as instructed and demonstrated. Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than half inch on counts 3, 8, and 9. Stepped completely offline by one shoe width on count 7 Took fourteen actual steps when instructed to take 9. One Leg Stand Test (3/4 observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Vasquez stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Left foot raised during the test. Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: Swayed body to the right and left.  Left foot hit the ground three times. Raised right arm more than six (6) inches from his side for balance. Seconds 11-20: Swayed body to the right and left. Left foot hit the ground two times. Raised right arm more than six (6) inches from his side for balance. Seconds 21-30: Nothing to report, Vasquez stopped the test on count 17 and stated I cant right now. Preliminary Breath Test: I explained and offered a PBT to Vasquez. Vasquez elected to consent to the PBT and results were .15 BrAC. ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Vasquez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely:  -Unable to stay within a single lane/driving patterns.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from vehicle.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath as he conversed with me.  -Watery and glassy eyes.    -His admissions to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving.  -Observed signs of impairment as he performed the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.    - Preliminary Breath Test result of .15 BrAC.  Vasquez was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a motor vehicle at 0041 hours and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack. A search incident to arrest revealed no weapons or contraband. Upon arrival at the Barrack, Vasquez was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, and it was read to him from the MVA website in Spanish, and he elected to consent to the Intoximeter EC/IR II test at 0116 hours. 20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Vasquez beginning with his arrest. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. He remained in my custody from the time of his arrest. Nothing was introduced to his mouth at any time. The test was conducted by Sgt. Twardowski intox ID #5455 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument and a result of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath was obtained at 0125 hours. Vasquez was polite and cooperative during the encounter. Vasquez was given pertinent paperwork and released from the Barrack to his friend pending an appearance in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County at a later date. All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
