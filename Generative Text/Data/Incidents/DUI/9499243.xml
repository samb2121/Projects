NARRATIVE:  Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:    On August 18, 2023, at approximately 0230 hours TFC P. Eckrich and I, TPR C. Merritt, were traveling South on US Route 13 in unmarked Maryland State Police patrol vehicle E-15. Upon approaching the intersection of US RT13 and South Blvd. I observed a vehicle, that appeared to be traveling above the posted speed limit, driving West on South Blvd. I observed this gray passenger vehicle disregard a steady red circular signal and cross US RT13. I observed the vehicle to turn right onto Waverly Drive and the immediately left onto Middle Blvd. Upon catching up to the vehicle I could identify that it was a Gray Volkswagen Jetta bearing Maryland registration 7ED4126. I observed this vehicle attempt to quickly back into a parking spot parallel to Middle Blvd. I then activated my emergency equipment to initiate a lawful traffic stop. I observed the vehicle continue to back until coming in contact with a Silver Ford Focus bearing Maryland registration 9DL1510, that was legally parked on Middle Blvd.      Phase #2 - Personal Contact   Upon contact with the operator of the Volkswagen, identified by Maryland drivers license as Vince Sigfried Jedeliz Umali DOB: 05/20/1999, I identified myself and the reason for the stop and advised him that our encounter was being audio and visually recorded. Umali was able to provide all necessary documents. Upon identifying the reason for the stop Umali advised that he was not familiar with the area and did not see the red light. Umali stated that he was coming to 231 Middle Blvd. to see some friends. I observed Umali to have glassy, bloodshot eyes, and his speech to be slightly slurred. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle while speaking with Umali. When asked, Umali stated that he did not have anything to drink, and that he was designated driving for his friends. I could observe numerous unopened cans of beer inside of Umalis vehicle. Upon having Umali exit the vehicle I could detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Umalis breath and person while speaking to me.   Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening  Based on my observations, I advised Umali that I would be conducting standardized field sobriety tests. When asked if he would voluntarily agree to perform Standardized Field Sobriety, Umali advised he would. I asked Umali a standard series of questions for pre-screening prior to performing the Standardized Field Sobriety test.  Do you wear contacts or glasses: Yes Any medication: No Any injuries or disabilities: No Umali stated he did not have any alcoholic beverages.  Umali continued outside the vehicle, and throughout the duration of our conversation to emit a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. Umali voluntarily agreed to submit to the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and I began with the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus  I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Umali and asked him if he had any questions about the test. Umali stated he did not have any questions about the test and I began.   Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes    Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation present in both eyes Onset of nystagmus prior to forty-five degrees present in both eyes  Vertical Nystagmus: Yes  Total Horizontal Gaze NystagmusClues:6 out of 6  Walk and Turn  Weather: Clear Surface: Level surface, clear of any debris. I observed Umali to be wearing white tennis shoes with an athletic sole.   I instructed Umali into the instructional phase, to which Umali was unable to maintain the heel to toe position. During my demonstration of the test Umali could not maintain his balance and broke heel to toe. Umali placed his left foot in front of his right and was instructed back into the proper starting position. I asked Umali if he had any questions to which Umali stated he did not have any questions.   Instructional Phase: -Cannot maintain balance  Walking stage 1st 9: -Missed heel to toe on 5, 7  -Incorrect number of steps (10) Turn: Incorrect; subject did not perform a turn as instructed. Subject did not keep his lead foot planted. Walking stage 2nd 9: -Steps off line on 2  -Incorrect number of steps (10)  Total Walk and Turn Clues: 5 of 8  One Leg Stand  I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Umali. I asked Umali if he had any questions to which Umali replied he did not have any questions.Umali picked up his left foot for the test.   Seconds 1-10: Raised arms for balance  Swayed  Hops Puts foot down at 2 second mark  Upon Umali picking his foot back up, he would start over counting.  Seconds 11-20: Raised arms for balance Swayed  Upon White picking her foot back up, she started over counting.  Seconds 21-30: Raised arms for balance  Total One Leg Stand Clues:4 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test    Umali was explained the reasons for using a preliminary breath test and asked if he wanted to submit a breath sample. Umali refused to submit to the PBT.  Arrest and Transport   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Umali was driving a motor vehicle under the influence: *Observed driving behavior  * Eyes bloodshot and glassy * Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his vehicle  * Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person *My observed signs of impairment during SFSTs.   I placed Umali under arrest for driving under the influence at 0245 hours. I placed Umali into the front passenger seat of unmarked patrol vehicle E-15. Umali was searched incident to arrest. Umalis vehicle was locked and the keys were given to his friends. I then entered my patrol vehicle at which time I detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present in my vehicle prior to placing Umali inside. The owner of the other vehicle was contacted and provided with the appropriate information 20 Minute Observation Period: I transported Umali to the Maryland State Police Salisbury barrack for processing. Umali was read the MVA DR-15 advice of rights in English. Umali stated he would submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 at 0313 hours.SGT K. Mareck, a certified intoximeter operator administered the test at 0321 hours. Umalis breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  Umali was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was released to a sober adult. All events did occur in Wicomico County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
