         <NarrativeText>Alexis Joaquin Larios  Maryland SOUNDEX: L-620-044-421-635 Breath Test Result: .18 DUI Citation # 66V0T5Y DUI Tape #: Video tagged as 23-MSP-028825 (Axon View XL Software)  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.). * Completed and graduated from the DUI Institute. * Completed and graduated from the SFST Instructor school  NARRATIVE -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION- On August 15, 2023 at approximately 0141hours, I (TFC. S. Shubert #6944), was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating unmarked MSP vehicle V-08 in the area of southbound Coastal highway at 48thStreet, Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland.   At that time, I observed a blue Chevrolet Silverado bearing Maryland registration (6FF6557) traveling northbound on Coastal Highway approaching 48th Street in lane one.   I observed the blue Silverado appeared to be traveling above the posted 35 MPH speed limit. The in-car Kustom Golden Eagle II front radar antenna was activated (Opposite direction mode) and had been checked before (and later after) my shift and appeared to be functioning properly. I am certified through the Maryland State Police to operate Radar/Lidar. I made the following observations:    A speed of 53 MPH in a posted 35 MPH zone was displayed on my in-car radar unit (Opposite direction mode) as the vehicle entered the influence of the radar beam.  I also observed the blue Silverado nearly travel through a steady red signal. However, abruptly stopped prior to proceeding through the intersection.  I safely made a U-turn and I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop.  -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT- I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver via the driver side door. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. I informed the driver the reason for the traffic stop and requested his drivers license and registration card. I also observed the driver to display a dazed/expression look on his face. The driver was identified through his Maryland drivers license as Alexis Joaquin Larios. I asked Larios where he was coming from and Larios stated The beach. I asked Larios how many alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to operating his motor vehicle and Larios stated I havent had anything. I observed Larios movements to be lethargic. As Larios spoke, I observed his eyes to be glassy and bloodshot. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks on Larios. I observed the blue Chevrolet Silverado registration status to be suspended.  I then returned to the blue Chevrolet Silverado and asked Larios to step out of his vehicle and walk to the back of it. I observed a  empty bottle of Corona beer on the drivers seat. Larios did as I requested. Larios then reached into his pocket and pulled out credit cards and advised he was handing me his ID. I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I asked Larios if he wanted to submit to standardized field sobriety tests to ensure he was not impaired, Larios agreed to submit to standardized field sobriety tests.   -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING- STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs) The evaluation was performed in the roadway area. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of overhead lights, headlights and flashlight. Larios appeared to be in general good physical condition and did not display any limps. Larios advised he hurt his right ankle.  Larios was wearing black pants and multi-colored short sleeve shirt.   **HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: 6 of 6 clues**  1. Larios displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  2. Larios displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. 3. Larios displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  **WALK AND TURN: 3 of 8 clues** First nine steps: No observations made Turn: Completed unsatisfactory, lifted lead foot  Second nine steps: -Missed heel to toe by approximately two inches on steps 4 -Stepped off line by approximately three inches on steps 6,9  **ONE LEG STAND: 1 of 4 clues** -Firmly placed left foot down one time during the test.   I then asked Larios if he could recite the English alphabet starting at the letter H ending at the letter T. Larios stated the following: H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T  After the conclusion of all Field Sobriety Tests, I offered Larios the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). Larios agreed to submit to the Preliminary breath test, which resulted in .17  -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING- ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Larios was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot.  * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  * I observed clues during his performance in SFST *lethargic movements   I placed Larios under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0202 hours on August 15, 2023. At this time, I visually inspected the inside of Larios mouth for any foreign objects and none were found.   ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) Larios was placed and secured in the right front seat of my patrol vehicle.Larios was given his Advice of Rights via the audio version of the DR-15 Form. I placed a copy of the DR-15 in front of Larios. Once the DR-15 was completed being played Larios stated that he understood his Advice of Rights. At approximately 0219 hours, agreed to submit to the Intoximeter test. I then transported Larios to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for processing.   Intoximeter: Cpl. Ruiz and myself checked Larios mouth for any foreign objects. Larios did not have any foreign objects or liquid located in his mouth. Larios gave two valid breath samples, which resulted in .18 BrAC.   PROCESSING During all aspects of processing (mugshot, completion and explanation of the DR-15A Form, issuance and explanation of citations), the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Larios continued to be strong.  I drove Larios around Ocean City for approximately 30 minutes attempting to locate his hotel that he was unable to remember where the exact location of the hotel was. Once arriving at the hotel, Larios was released.  CHARGES Larios was charged with the following citations: 1. Driving Vehicle While Under The Influence Of Alcohol (66W0T5Y) 2. Driving While Impaired By Alcohol (66X0T5Y) 3. Negligent driving(66Y0T5Y) 4. Exceeding the maximum posted speed limit (66V0T5Y) 5. Driving vehicle with suspended registration (66Z0T5Y) 6. Driver consumic alcoholic beverage in passenger area (6700T5Y 7. Driving while under the influence of alcohol per se (6710T5Y)  Case closed by arrest. All events occurred in Worcester County, MD. </NarrativeText>
