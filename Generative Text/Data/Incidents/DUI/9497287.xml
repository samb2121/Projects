Loudin #6490, was advised by dispatch that Sgt. Shipley #2861 was on a traffic stop, and he believed the driver to be impaired. I responded to Sgt. Shipleys traffic stop, located at Bachman Valley Road and Eckard Road in Westminster, Carroll County Maryland.    I made contact with Sgt. Shipley, who advised that the vehicle was all over the road and observed a few traffic violations prior to stopping the vehicle. He noted that the vehicle could not maintain its lane, failed to drive right of center and the lights on the vehicle kept coming on and going off. He then advised that when he made contact, he immediately could tell that the driver was impaired by his appearance. Sgt.

I advised the driver that Sgt. Shipley was the one who intialy pulled him over, however his shift was coming to an end and requested another unit to continue the traffic stop. I asked the driver for his name and date of birth, the driver then identified himself as Sinhasunkage, Sadip Kavinda Gun (DOB: 11/04/1997) by a presented Maryland Drivers License.   I asked Mr. Sinhasunkage if he had consumed any alcohol, and he advised that he had consumed alcohol at his home. I also asked if he smoked marijuana and at first he denied smoking marijuana,but then admitted to smoking and drinking alcohol approximately forty minutes prior. He advised that he normally smokes in the car. I detected the odor of burnt marijuana and a faint odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be blood shot and his movements and reaction to my questions to be delayed or slow.  Pre Arrest Screening   I requested Mr. Sinhasunkage to exit the vehicle. He then put his hand on the gear shifter and it appeared as though he was going to try and leave. I told him not to and he changed the shifter from park to drive. I again told him not to leave, and he looked at me when I said  no and then changed the gear back to park. Mr. Sinhasunkage then exited the vehicle.
