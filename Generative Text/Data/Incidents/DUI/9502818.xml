         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-011601 DUI #23-58-065 Harmony Road @ Wilkins Branch Road, Preston, Caroline County, MD TROOPER T. BENSON #7099 MARYLAND STATE POLICE - EASTON BARRACK  Maryland State Police (MSP) unmarked patrol vehicle I-5 is equipped with a mobile video recording device. Body Worn Camera was operational. Stop recorded.  Defendant: Name: Robert Nathaniel Evans  Date of Birth: 04/03/1979 DE SDX#: 1165545  Date of Arrest: 04/01/2023 Time of Arrest: 0326 DUI #: 23-58-065 (Easton Barrack)  Training  Certificates: * I am trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training. * I have successfully completed Enhanced DUI Enforcement Training through the Maryland State Police SPIDRE Team. * I have successfully completed Cannabis Impaired Detection Workshop through the Maryland State Police.  Narrative: On Saturday, April 1, 2023, at approximately 0256 hours, I, TFC. Benson #7099, was dispatched to Harmony Road and Wilkins Branch Road in Preston, Caroline County, MD for the report of a motor vehicle collision involving a vehicle on the guardrail.   Phase 2  Personal Contact: Upon my arrival, I observed one (1) black Alan Meyers Ford F-150, bearing MD registration 8EF1701, off the roadway with the front of the vehicle in the ditch and the rear of the vehicle stuck on top of the guardrail. The vehicle airbags had deployed and the contents of the bed of the pickup truck, including two external gas tanks, were scattered throughout the scene creating a large debris field. Caroline County EMS Paramedic #12 was on scene at the time speaking with the driver, identified by his DE drivers license as Robert Nathaniel Evans, DOB: 04/03/1979, 2/M, who refused medical treatment. Prior to making contact with Evans, EMS personnel and a Firefighter on scene both informed me that Evans stated he had been drinking.  Upon making contact with Evans I asked him what happened, to which he stated bad things between me and my wife, thats all. Just drunk. Im sorry. Evans informed me he had been drinking but was unable to stated exactly how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed, stating I cant say I had a lot. Evans continued to apologize multiple times. While speaking with Evans I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his person, I observed Evans eyes to be red, bloodshot and glassy, and Evans displayed slurred speech while answering questions.   Evans stated he had just been riding around. When asked where he had been coming from, Evans avoided answering the question directly and repeated that he had just been riding around while at the same time shrugging his shoulders. Evans then stated he had hit a deer and thats what caused the collision. It should be noted that upon examination of the vehicle and the scene, I did not observe a deer nor did I observe any signs (i.e. Hair, blood, etc.) that would indicate Evans struck a deer prior to driving off the roadway.  Phase 3  Pre-Arrest Screening: Based on my observations, I asked Evans to submit to a series of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Evans stated You dont need to put me through tests, I drank. Evans then agreed to submit to the tests, stating thats fine. Evans then stated, Dude I have two DUIs and Im going to jail for 6 months. Evans then refused to submit to SFSTs.  Medical Pre-Screening: Not completed due to Evans refusing to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Testing.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) Test: Evans refused to complete this test.  A total of zero (0) clues were observed during this test.  Walk and Turn (WAT) Test: Evans refused to complete this test.  A total of zero (0) clues were observed during this test.  One Leg Stand (OLS): Evans refused to complete this test.  A total of zero (0) clues were observed during this test.  Preliminary Breath Test (PBT): Evans was not offered the PBT roadside.  Conclusion: Based on my observations, the results of the Standardized Field Sobriety, along with my training, knowledge, and experience Evans was placed under arrest at approximately 0326 hours. Evans was read the English audio version of the Advice of Rights form (DR-15) and an English copy was placed on his lap to read along. Evans refused to submit to an intoximeter test at approximately 0340 hours. Photographs were taken and attached to the ACRS report which has been uploaded to this report. Chambers Towing was contacted, per Evans requested, and removed the vehicle from the scene. Evans was transported to the MSP Easton Barrack, located at 7053 Ocean Gateway, Easton, MD 21601. Evans was issued the appropriate paperwork and released from the barrack to his wife, Danielle Marie Evans, DOB: 12/14/1977, 2/F, at approximately 0523.
