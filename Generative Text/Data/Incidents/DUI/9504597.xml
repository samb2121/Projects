Defendant: Pamala Marie Rocco Drivers license #: MD R-200-676-585-611 Date of Arrest: 7/29/23 Time of Arrest: 2216 hours DUI #: 23-96-221 PBT Results: refusal Intoximeter Results: Refusal   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING   -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. -Trained ARIDE test through the Maryland State Police. -Completed certified SFST instructor class.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 7/29/2023 at approximately 2158 hours, I, Trooper First Class C. Shubert #7062 with the Maryland State Police was on-duty and operating unmarked patrol vehicle V-11 in the area of Golf Course Road and US Route 50, Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland. At that time, I was traveling northbound on Golf Course Road when I observed in front of me a silver Jeep bearing Maryland registration (7EM9672) that had crossed the center yellow line two (2) times by a tire width and one (1) time by half the width of the vehicle. While I was following the vehicle I also observed the vehicle cross the stop line at the intersection of Golf Course Road and US Route 50 by all four tires. I activated the emergency equipment to my patrol vehicle and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle continued straight onto Golf Course Road and merged onto the right side of the road and came to a complete stop.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the driver. I advised the driver why she was being stopped. While speaking with the driver, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. The drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I identified the driver as Pamala Marie Rocco through her Maryland license. I asked Rocco where she was coming from, to which she advised:Sellos. I then asked Rocco how many alcoholic beverages she consumed prior to driving to which she advised:A glass of wine with dinner.I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine MVA checks on Rocco. I later returned to Roccos vehicle and asked her to step out and to walk to the front of her vehicle. Rocco complied. While at the front of her vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Roccos breath and person. I asked Rocco how many alcoholic beverages she consumed in total, to which she advised:Two glasses of wine with dinner.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed in the on the right side of Golf Course Road. The surface was flat and free from any obvious debris. The weather was cloudy and approximately 79 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight, vehicle headlights. My forward emergency equipment was deactivated during all testing. Rocco appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injury.    I asked Rocco the following pre-testing questions:   1. Injuries: NO 2. Glasses: NO 3. Medications:NO    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6 of 6 clues observed)   1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes. 2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes. ***NOTE*** Rocco had vertical gaze nystagmus present   WALK AND TURN (4 of 8 clues observed) (wearing heels)   Instructional Stage:      Broke heel to toe contact in an attempt to maintain balance    Walking Stage (1st Nine):    1. Stepped off of the line more than an inch on step 2.    2. Took eleven (11) steps instead of nine as demonstrated.    Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    1. Stepped off of the line more than an inch on steps 3, 7.   2. Missed heel to toe contact more than half an inch on steps 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.   ONE LEG STAND (1 of 4 clues observed) (Right foot)       Put foot down on second 1, 2, 11, 22.    ADDITIONAL TESTING:     ALPHABET TEST      I asked Rocco if she knew the English alphabet, to which she advised:Yes.I instructed Rocco to recite from the letter H to the letter T without singing the alphabet. Rocco completed this test satisfactorily.      PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST   I offered Rocco the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test, and Rocco refused to the preliminary breath test.   While conducting standardized field sobriety test, two passengers who were heavily intoxicated started becoming disorderly. Additional units arrived on-scene and later placed two passengers under arrest. TFC Brader will complete a supplement narrative.   ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Rocco was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   * crossing the center line into on-coming traffic portion of road * Crossing the stop line * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as she performed field sobriety tests.   At approximately 2216 hours, I placed Rocco under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I placed Rocco in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. While still on-scene, I played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Rocco via the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) official website. At the conclusion of the audio version of the DR-15 form, I verbally repeated and reviewed the possible suspensions and sanctions that can be imposed by the MVA to Roccos driving privilege. Rocco refused to the Intoximeter test and signed the same at approximately 2228 hours.   TRANSPORT   Rocco was subsequently transported to her residence. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Rocco continued to be strong.     RELEASE   Rocco was released to her friend at her residence.   CHARGES   Rocco was charged with the following:   1. Driving vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (5ZN0UR8) 2. Driving vehicle while impaired by alcohol (5ZM0UR8) 5. Driver failure to stop at stop line (5ZL0UR8) 6. Driver failure to stop at stop line (5ZL0UR8)  Case closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 7/29/2023 at 2203 hours, I, TFC Brader responded to assist TFC C. Shubert on his traffic stop located at Golf Course Road north of US 50, Ocean City, Worcester County. TFC Shubert advised two subjects were acting disorderly in the vehicle he had stopped.  Upon my arrival, I meet with a subject, identified as Bradford Breen (DOB: 4/16/1980) who was seated on the curb next to the entrance of the Wine Rack. Breen began to state how he didnt do a single thing at all. Breen began to advise us about how much he supports police. While speaking with Breen, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. Breen had slow and lethargic speech.  Breen shouted at a vehicle driving by Move it man. Breen asked why he was sitting on the curb and he was advised because he was causing a scene and distraction during the traffic stop. I walked to the Jeep and made contact with Brandon Connolly (ODB: 4/26/1983) who was seated in the passenger side seat of the vehicle.  I walk back towards Breen and he yelled Did he fuck you? and you definitely got fucked. Breen shouted that guy got fucked. I advised Breen he needed to lower his voice because he was drawing attention from people at the Wine Rack. I advised Breen that if he continues, I will arrest him. Breen asked for what? and I advised him disorderly conduct. I observed customers going in and out of the store to be looking in our direction due to Breens disturbance and yelling. I advised Breen that I advised him of his warning.  Breen then proceeded to get up and walk into the parking lot of the Wine rack. Breen walked behind the fencing that surrounds the garbage cans. I heard Breen begin to scream and cheer as he was seated on the curb on the other side of the fencing. I observed customers look his way as they were entering and exiting the Wine rack store. I observed the customers direct their attention to Breen due to his actions and loud cheering.  I walked over to Breen and advised him that he was under arrest. I placed handcuffs on Breen. Breen asked for what? and I advised him disorderly conduct.  I walked Breen to my patrol vehicle. Breen was placed inside my patrol vehicle. Breen began to yell and shout as he was being placed into my patrol vehicle.  Connolly exited the vehicle and became angered due to the driver being placed under arrest for DUI.  Connolly walked towards my vehicle. Breen yelled at Connolly to Shut the fuck up Brandon. Breen continued to shout. I requested Ocean City Police Department to bring their wagon due to Breens actions.  Connolly was angered that his friend Breen was placed under arrest. Connolly walked back towards our direction and loudly stated what the fuck. As Connolly was walking he raised his hands and stated bunch of assholes. I continued to observe customers entering the Wine Rack and at the gas pumps to be looking our direction due to Connollys choice of words and actions. Connolly continued to be upset talking towards our direction. I was not able to understand what Connolly was saying due to him walking around the area of the traffic stop and raising his hands. The Wine Rack had several customers parked out front of the store and also at the gas pumps who were looking towards our direction due to Connollys behavior.  I walked over to Connolly and advised him he is under arrest. I placed handcuffs on Connolly. Connolly then asked if he can just go home. I advised no and that he was under arrest.  Ocean City Police Wagon arrived on scene. Breen and Connolly were transported to the Ocean City Police Department for processing.  I issued Breen a DC-CR-045 Criminal Citation for Disorderly Conduct (Tracking 202001483412).  I issued Connolly a DC-CR-045 Criminal Citation for Disorderly Conduct (Tracking 202001483423).  Breen and Connolly were released on the Criminal Citation.  All events occurred in Worcester County, MD. </NarrativeText>
