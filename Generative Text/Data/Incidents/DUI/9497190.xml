Norfolk 7120 was patrolling the area of South Salisbury Blvd @ Bateman St, Salisbury MD 21801 when I observed a red Chevrolet Camaro sitting at the Dogwood Ave light in the left turn lane. I observed the vehicle to have an out third brake light, When the light turned green the Camaro completed the U-turn in a very slow manner as if they never hit the accelerator but just let off the brake. I also observed the vehicle to have an altered exhaust that I was unable to hear after the vehicle completed the U-turn which showed the vehicle never tried to accelerate as a normal vehicle would. I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle for the brake light being out. The weather was clear and warm; traffic was very light due to the time of night on a weekend. Phase Two - Personal Contact:  I contacted the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle identified as Anderson Sanchez-Lopez. Lopez was advised the reason for the traffic stop and asked to provide me with his license and registration. I was able to observe Lopez to have blood shot and glassy eyes. I asked Lopez where he was coming from, and he advised his friends residence where they had a small party. I was able to observe Lopez to have slurred and slowed speech. I asked Lopez what alcohol he had to drink to tonight, and he advised that he had some tequila. Lopez gave me the information that I asked for. I asked Lopez to step out of the vehicle to complete Standard Field Sobriety Testing which he agreed.   Phase Three - Pre-Arrest Screening:  Once Lopez was out of the vehicle I was able to smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person. Lopez was observed to have trouble walking to the back of his vehicle and staggered from side to side while walking. Lopez also had difficulty standing upright without swaying from side to side and leaned on my patrol vehicle on several occasions to maintain balance.  At the time of testing, Lopez was wearing tennis shoes and appropriate clothing for the season. The area where the testing was completed was flat and level and free from debris. The testing area was lit by my patrol vehicles headlights and nearby streetlights.  Before administering the tests, I asked Lopez if Lopez had any medical conditions or physical issues that would keep him from completing any of the tests today, which advised that he did not. Lopez was asked if he wore contact and or glasses. Lopez advised that he did wear glasses but not contacts. Lopez advised that he needs the glasses to see. Lopez only had his glasses off for the first test which requires no walking. My front-facing emergency equipment and spotlight were deactivated before beginning the tests. The first test administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test:  I explained the test to Lopez. He advised that he understood my instructions and did not have any questions.   Displayed the lack of smooth pursuit and equal tracking in both eyes.  Displayed the Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  Displayed the Onset of Nystagmus before 45 degrees in both eyes.  A check for Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was conducted with negative results.  A total of (six) clues were observed during this test. The second test administered was the Walk and Turn Test:  I explained and demonstrated the test to Lopez who advised that he understood my directions.    Lopez had to move his feet from heel-to-toe contact and had to move his feet on multiple occasions to maintain balance.   Lopez completed most of the test with his arms raised more than 6 inches from his body.  Stopped walking after the first set of steps and asked for further instruction.  Completed an improper turn by turning to the right while not using a series of steps.  Missed heel to toe on step 3,6 during the first set of steps test. Missed heel to toe on step 2,6 on the second set of steps  Stepped offline on step 3,6 during the first set of steps and step 7 on the second set of steps.  A total of (6) clues were observed during this test. The third test administered was the One Leg Stand Test:  I explained and demonstrated the test to Lopez who advised that he understood my directions.    Put his foot down repeatedly during the test in an attempt to keep from falling.  Swaying from side to side by approximately three inches during the test.  Raised his arms approximately 18 to 20 inches from the side of his body to maintain balance.  A total of two (3) clues were observed during this test.  Lopez was offered the Preliminary Breath Test on the roadside which he agreed to take. Lopez gave a breath sample that measured .13 on my calibrated PBT.  Based on observations of Lopezs driving, physical appearance, and performance of SFST he was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0113 hours on 04-15-2023. Lopez was seated in my patrol vehicle. When I entered my vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present before being seated in it. Lopez was transported to the Salisbury Barrack for processing. While at the barrack, he was read and allowed to read his DR-15 advice of rights. After completing the DR-15, Lopez agreed to submit to the intoximeter at 0148 hours. Lopez submitted a sample of .11 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Lopez was released to a sober person at the barrack after being provided all of his paperwork.  All events occurred in Wicomico County, MD.  Based on all the above facts, I request that the case be closed by arrest. CASE CLOSED.  </NarrativeText>
