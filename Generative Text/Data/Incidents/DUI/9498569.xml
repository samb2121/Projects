         <NarrativeText>R-27 is not equipped with an in-car camera. Body worn camera was activated.  Defendant: Richard Johnathan P Brickner Date of Birth: 03/13/1987 Time of Arrest: 0206 DWI#: 23-514   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E)   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On September 25, 2023, at approximately 0113 hours, I, Trooper Hunt #7356 was on duty in official capacity as Maryland State Trooper operating Marked MSP vehicle R-27 assigned to the Golden Ring Barrack located at, Baltimore County, Essex Maryland. I was dispatched to a two-vehicle collision that occurred on northbound I-95 prior to I-695 (west side). Upon my arrival I, observed a blue Ford Mustang bearing Maryland registration 9EL8947 with all around heavy damaged and a Tractor trailer bearing Minnesota registration 946STV that was 500 feet ahead on the right shoulder.   PERSONAL CONTACT I made contact with the operator of the blue Ford Mustang who was standing outside his vehicle on the passengers side who was later identified by their Maryland drivers license as Richard Johnathan P Brickner, (W/M), DOB: 03/13/1987. I asked Brickner to tell me what happen, and he stated that he got struck from the rear of his vehicle. I detected a strong odor of alcohol beverage coming from Brickners breath and observed his eyes to be watery and glassy. I asked Brickner where he was coming from, and he informed me that he was coming from Starling Virginia and going to his friends house in Annapolis. I asked Brickner if he was out with friends, and he stated yes then I asked Brickner if he was drinking, and he stated no.  I made contact with the operated of the tractor trailer who was later identified by their Minnesota drivers license as Mohamed Abukar Ali Shiekh, (IND/M), DOB: 01/01/1986. I asked Shiekh to tell me what happen, and he informed me that he was traveling in lane 3 and the blue Mustang was traveling in lane 4. Shiekh informed me that the Mustang started to weave in between lanes 4 and 3, then made unsafe lane change into lane 3 striking sheikhs truck on the passengers tire. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct a routine check and complete an accident exchange sheet.  I returned to Brickner who was sitting on drivers side rear trunk of his vehicle. I asked Brickner where he was coming from a second time and stated Starling Virginia, going to Annapolis. I asked Brickner how much he had to drink, and he stated One drink, and it was a blue moon. I asked Brickner how big the drink was and Brickner stated in an aggravated tone It was like this big, the dude ripped off the back of the car, off of one fucking drink and Brickner continued to state one drink didnt do this. Brickner then offered to show me a receipt of the drink he had consumed during that time. I informed Brickner that I wanted him to perform a Standardize Field Sobriety test, which he agreed to take.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder on northbound I-95 prior to I-695. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear, cold and it was dark outside. Brickner appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, limp, or any limb ailments.  I asked Todd the following questions: Injuries- No Medication- No Medical Conditions- No Glasses/Contacts- No observed    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was use as the stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Brickners eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Brickners pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed. I asked Brickner if he understood the instructions, and he stated yes. Before I began the test Brickner informed me that he is a medical worker and works with eyes. Brickner informed me that he can tell if Im doing the test right or wrong. During the lack of smooth pursuit, I had told Brickner twice to stop turning his head.    Lack of smooth pursuit- present in both eyes  Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees- present in both eyes   Vertical Nystagmus-present   WALK AND TURN (5/8 CLUES OBSERVED)  Prior to Brickner performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Brickner was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Brickner was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Brickner was advised to take (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe every step. Brickner was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Brickner was explained and demonstrated to his lead foot on the line, and to take series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Brickner was again explained and demonstrated the second series of (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Brickner was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Brickner if he understood the test, and he stated yes.  Instructional stage: started to soon twice Walking stage (1st Nine)    Raise arms on steps one-three    Walking stage (2nd Nine)    Raises arms on steps two-four   Steps off-line on step seven   Misses heel to toe on step eight    Turn Nothing to report.    ONE LEG STAND (3/4 CLUES OBSERVED)  Prior to Brickner performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Brickner was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (One thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Brickner if he understood the test, and he stated, Yes.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10:    Raise arms   Seconds 11-20:    Sways   Puts foot down      Seconds 21-30:    Raise arms  Puts foot down     Arrest Based on the following above, Ihad reason to believe that Brickner was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcoholic.  I arrested Brickner approximately 0206 hours, placed him in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. I transported Brickner to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for DUI processing. While en-route to the barrack, I played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights from to Brickner. At the conclusion of the audio, Brickner agreed to take the intoximeter test at approximately 0223 hours. While at the barrack, I gave Brickner a copy of the DR-15 form to review, and he submitted to the intoximeter with a result of .14 BrAC. Brickner was issued the appropriate paperwork and released to a sober ride.   All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland. __________________________________________ Body worn camera video request are made to Sgt. Twardowski.
