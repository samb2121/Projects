         <NarrativeText>DUI # 23-100   R-41 is equipped with a mobile video recording device, and it was functioning properly. Two segments of this incident are available. The Field Sobriety Testing is recorded utilizing R-41 MVR, as well as body camera footage from myself. Driver habits during transport are recorded on the interior camera of R-41.  Defendant: Elmer Alexander Lopez Perez Date of Birth: 03/19/1983 Date of Arrest: 02/18/2023 Time of Arrest: 0529 hours  Training Certifications:  * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police (MSP) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Trained operator of Preliminary Breath Test (PBT)  Narrative:  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On Saturday, February 18, 2023, at approximately 0442hrs, I, Trooper Rhoten #7513 was on routine patrol in Maryland State Police vehicle R-41 when I was dispatched to a single motor vehicle collision in the area of I/L 695 at Baltimore National Pike.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I arrived on scene and noticed a gray Acura sedan with MD registration 9CK3711 that had two passenger side tires on top of the concrete barrier, and the drivers side two tires that were touching the pavement. I noticed there were a driver and passenger inside the vehicle that were struggling the get the drivers side door open because it was wedged into the pavement. I was able to get the drivers side door open to get the driver and passenger out of the vehicle. Upon the drivers side door opening, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the drivers side compartment of the Acura. I was able to identify the driver as Elmer Alexander Lopez Perez, DOB 03/19/1983 through his Maryland drivers license. As I was talking to Perez, I was getting a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting directly from his breath. I asked Perez numerous times how the Acura got up onto the concrete barrier, and he stated he didnt know.  On my second approach, I asked Perez to walk in front of his vehicle, and he complied. I asked Perez how much he has had to drink, and he stated I want to be drunk all the time, and I am drunk right now. As he spoke, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, emitting from his direct breath and person. I advised Perez that I believed he was driving under the influence of alcohol, and requested him to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST), to which he submitted.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The SFST was performed on I/L 695 at Baltimore National Pike on the right shoulder in front of Perezs vehicle. It was dry and approximately 40 degrees with clear skies. The road was level and free from any debris. The direct area for testing was illuminated by the headlights of my patrol vehicle, vehicle headlights driving by, and my flashlight. Additionally, my patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. I observed Perez to be wearing a jacket, jeans, and sneakers.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Perezs eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. His pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. He was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Perez was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, a little bit.   1/2) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 3/4) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 5/6) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes    Although not a direct clue, Perez failed to follow the pen as instructed numerous times and had to be reminded to follow the pen with his eyes and eyes only.   WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  Prior to Perez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Perez was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. He was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. He was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Perez was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Perez was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. He was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping his hands down by his sides, looking down at his feet, and counting each step out loud. Perez was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):  Perez missed heel to toe on every step by approximately 2-3 inches.  Perez stepped offline on every step by not touching heel to toe.  Perez took thirteen (13) steps instead of the nine (9) he was instructed to.  Turn: Perez turned around and did not keep his lead foot planted.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  Perez stopped the test after the improper turn and had to be reminded to conduct 9 more heel-to-toe steps back.  Perez missed heel to toe on every step approximately 2-3 inches.  Perez stepped offline on every step by not touching heel-to-toe Perez took twelve (12) steps instead of the nine (9) he was instructed to.  Although not a direct clue, Perez had to be told numerous times to take his hands out of his pocket during the test.    ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)    Prior to Perez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. He was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Perez was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated Yes   Balance and Count Stage:  Perez swayed from side to side for the entire duration of the test. Perez raised his arms over the 6-inch minimum to approximately 12 inches away from his body, during the entire duration of the test. Perez placed his foot down on two (2) occasions and after the second occasion, he kept his foot down for the remainder of the test.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST:  The Preliminary Breath Test was offered to Perez and refused.    ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Perez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence:   -Strong odor of alcoholic beverage on breath -Motor vehicle collision  -Slurred speech  -Glassy eyes  -Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages  -Clues observed during Field Sobriety Testing   Due to the number of observations, I concluded Perez was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0529 hours, I placed Perez under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Perez was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy. He was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing.   *** 20-Minute Observation Period***    I conducted a 20-minute observation period on Perez from the time of arrest, where I inspected his mouth and determined there to be no foreign objects of any kind.  The DR-15 Advice of Rights was audibly read to Perez in Spanish, and he was also provided a copy to read over at which time he agreed to submit to the Intoximeter Test at 0623. The test was administered by Sgt. Taylor #5867, on the intoximeter at 0717 hours. The test result was 0.17 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  INTOXIMETER RESULT:   ***0.17 BrAC**   Perez was very polite and cooperative throughout the process. Perez was given copies of all pertinent paperwork, including citations for driving under the influence of alcohol, and was released from the Barrack to a sober driver; Hamilton Garcia.   All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  I request this case remain open, pending an approved accident report.</NarrativeText>
