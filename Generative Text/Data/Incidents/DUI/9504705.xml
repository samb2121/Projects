BENSON #7099 MARYLAND STATE POLICE - EASTON BARRACK  Maryland State Police (MSP) marked patrol vehicle I-33 is equipped with a mobile video recording device. Body Worn Camera was operational. Interior, rear facing, camera not operational. Incident recorded.  Defendant: Name: Shelby Renee Winik Date of Birth: 05/29/1981 MD SDX#: MD-10273486176 Date of Arrest: 08/19/2023 Time of Arrest: 1122 hours DUI #: 23-58-169 (Easton Barrack)  Training  Certificates: * I am trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training. * I have successfully completed Enhanced DUI Enforcement Training through the Maryland State Police SPIDRE Team. * I have successfully completed Cannabis Impaired Detection Workshop through the Maryland State Police.  Narrative: On Saturday, August 19, 2023, at approximately 1035 hours, I, TFC. Benson #7099, was operating Maryland State Police (MSP) marked patrol vehicle I-33 on a traffic enforcement assignment in the area of Shore Highway and Meetinghouse Road in Denton, Caroline County, MD.  Phase 1  Vehicle in Motion: At this time, I observed an older model tan Toyota Camry, bearing MD Historic registration 5Z4104, traveling eastbound on Shore Highway in the area of River Road in Denton, Caroline County, MD. At this time, I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle came to a stop in lane 1 of eastbound Shore Highway east of River Road. Upon contact with the driver I instructed her to safely move her vehicle to the right shoulder of the roadway.  Phase 2  Personal Contact: I made contact with the driver of the vehicle who was identified by her MD drivers license as Shelby Renee Winik, DOB: 05/29/1981, 2/F. Upon contact with Winik I observed a white powdery substance on Winiks left nostril that I recognized and suspected to be a controlled dangerous substance. Winik was unable to sit still in the driver seat of the vehicle as we spoke. I observed Winik constantly moving around inside the vehicle as she appeared to fidget with items inside the vehicle. When asked where she was coming from, Winik informed me she was coming from Baltimore. Based on the previous listed observations I requested the services of Talbot County Sheriff Office K-9 Unit to conduct a free air sniff of the vehicle. TSO Cpl. Smith and K-9 arrived on scene and conducted a K-9 scan of the vehicle which resulted in a positive alert. Probable Cause search of the vehicle was conducted with negative results. During the search of the vehicle, I observed a large amount of empty White Claw cans scattered throughout the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Also located were two cooler bags with unopened White Claws inside. Located in the center console cup holder of the vehicle was one (1) clear plastic cup containing a clear carbonated liquid that I recognized and suspected through my training, knowledge, and experience to be the alcoholic beverage White Claw. The clear plastic cup was cool to the touch at the time of the search.   Phase 3  Pre-Arrest Screening: At this time, I asked Winik to submit to a series of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs), to which she agreed.  Medical Pre-Screening: Winik appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any physical injuries. Winik was wearing a dark colored V-neck t-shirt, blue jeans, and black fuzzy slippers. I informed Winik that she could remove her slippers and conduct the tests barefoot if that was more comfortable. I asked Winik the following questions:  Doctor and/or Physical Therapist  Yes, sees psychiatrist for mental health Physical Injuries No. Medical Conditions Yes, anxiety. Medication Yes. Alprazolam and Adderall. Glasses and/or contacts Yes, glasses. Winik stated her glasses were located somewhere inside the vehicle.  I asked Winik if she could walk in a straight line, turn around, and walk back, to which she stated she could. I asked Winik if she could balance on one (1) foot to which she stated she could. I asked Winik if she had consumed any alcoholic beverages, to which she stated she had NOT consumed any alcoholic beverages but she had gone to a concert the night prior. I asked Winik if she had consumed medication or any other substances, to which she stated she had taken her Alprazolam as prescribed earlier that morning at approximately 0500 hours.   Standardized Field Sobriety Testing was conducted on the shoulder of Shore Highway. The shoulder was flat and free of debris. The weather was clear and sunny with an approximate temperature of 80 degrees.   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) Test: Prior to beginning the test, I instructed Winik to stand with her feet together and her arms down at her sides. I explained the test to Winik. Winik advised she understood and did not have any questions. Prior to beginning the test, I held my pen twelve (12) to fifteen (15) inches from Winiks nose, slightly above eye level. Her pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Not Present.  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (VGN) was conducted and NOT present.  A total of four (4) clues were observed during this test.  Walk and Turn (WAT) Test: Prior to beginning the test, I instructed Winik to imagine a straight line, on the shoulder of Shore Highway, with her right foot directly in front of her left foot touching heel to toe and to place her arms down by her sides. At this time, I demonstrated and explained the test to Winik. Winik advised she understood and did not have any questions.   Instructional Stage: 1.) Lost Balance one (1) time.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Raised arms more than six (6) inches on steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 2.) Stops walking after step 9  Turn: Performed unsatisfactorily. Turn was not performed as instructed. Winik failed to keep her front foot planted and take a serious of small choppy steps with her opposite foot. Winik twisted around on both feet.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Stops walking after the turn. 2.) Completed a total of 10 steps, but only counted 9  I observed both Winiks legs shaking aggressively throughout the entirety of the test.  A total of five (5) clues were observed during this test.  One Leg Stand (OLS): Prior to Winik performing the test, I demonstrated and instructed her to stand with her feet together and arms down by her sides. I explained and demonstrated the test to Winik. Upon completion of my explanation and demonstration, Winik advised she understood and did not have any questions. Winik stated she was going to balance on her right foot, raising her left foot off the ground.   Instructional Stage: Nothing observed.  Balance and Counting Stage: Seconds 0-10: 1.) Nothing observed.  Seconds 11-20: 1.) Nothing observed.  Seconds 21-30: 1.) Nothing observed.  Winik counted 24 seconds in a total of 30 seconds. I observed Winiks right leg shaking throughout the entirety of the test.   A total of zero (0) clues were observed during this test.  Preliminary Breath Test (PBT): Winik was offered a Preliminary Breath Test. Winik refused to submit to the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT), stating she had been at a concert last night. Winik then voluntarily changed her mind and agreed to the breath test. The PBT revealed a result of 0.10 BrAC roadside.   Conclusion: Based on my observations, the results of the Standardized Field Sobriety, along with my training, knowledge, and experience Winik was placed under arrest at approximately 1132 hours. Winik was read the English audio version of the Advice of Rights form (DR-15) and an English copy was placed on her lap to read along. Winik agreed to an intoximeter test at approximately 1136 hours. Winik stated that she is an alcoholic and she relapsed several months ago, but stated she had not consumed any alcoholic beverages that day. She stated she was still intoxicated from the concert the previous evening. Winik was transported to the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, located at 7053 Ocean Gateway, Easton, MD 21601. Upon arrival at the barrack, a chemical breath test was administered, at approximately 1228 hours, by breath test operator Sgt. Goldman #5099.
