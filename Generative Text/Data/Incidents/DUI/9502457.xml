When I arrived on scene I observed a Burgandy Lincoln (MD 8FC5467) on the shoulder. I woke up the driver of the Burgandy Lincoln Continental who I identified by his MVA profile as William Joel Gee 3rd (DOB 03/30/1985).  I approached the driver side of the Burgandy Lincoln Continental and observed that the driver was slumped over the wheel. I knocked on the windshield numerous times until the driver woke up. Gee 3rd stated that he was on his way to his aunts house and felt tired, so he pulled over. Gee 3rd advised he took Gabapentin one-hour prior to driving.As I spoke to Gee 3rd, I detected an odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle.I asked Gee 3rd if he had any alcoholic beverages prior to driving, Gee 3rd stated he had a drink around 8am. I asked Gee 3rd if he would be willing to participate in Standardized Field Sobriety Testing and he agreed.    The test was conducted on a flat dry surface free of debris. My patrol vehicle was positioned in a safe manner, with my forward emergency lights deactivated during all three tests. I asked Gee 3rd if he had any physical injuries that would prevent him from performing the test. Gee 3rd advised No. I then asked if he was taking any medications, Gee 3rd stated he takes medication HIV, Blood Pressure and Gabapentin.
