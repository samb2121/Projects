         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on body worn and in car camera.  ATTACHMENTS: METERS printouts Citations (traffic and criminal) Notice to appear Chain of custody paperwork  DRIVER: Michael ThomasShekletski  W/M  09/09/1995 935 W Liberty Rd Sykesville, MD 240-858-9692  NARRATIVE: On 03/18/2023, at approximately 1230 hours, I was on patrol in the town of Sykesville, MD. I was conducting routine traffic enforcement in the area of MD97 and W Old Liberty Rd. I was traveling south behind a couple of vehicles and noted that the lead vehicle, a red Ford Expedition, was traveling well under the posted speed limit. As the vehicle went through the traffic circle I was able to get behind the vehicle. As the vehicle continued west on W Old Liberty Rd. towards Bushey Rd., I requested a return on the registration, Maryland 3BF6923. At that time I learned the vehicles registration was suspended for failure to comply with the emissions inspection program since 09/17/2021. I also took note that the registration was expired and had been since 06/30/2021, although it was displaying a 22 registration sticker on the rear registration plate.  After the vehicle turned left from Bushey Rd. onto MD26 I conducted a motor vehicle stop. I made contact with the driver who eventually identified himself by MD photo ID as Michael Thomas Shekletski.Shekletski, who was not wearing a seat belt, informed me that he did not have his license, registration or proof of insurance when I asked for those documents. He said that he was on his way home from a friends funeral and that he did not have a ride otherwise.Shekletski told me that the vehicle belonged to his deceased mother. When asked if the vehicle was insured, he informed me that it was not.  While speaking withShekletski, he appeared extremely nervous. He was breathing heavily, his voice was trembling, low and raspy. He was talking fast and at times he sounded as though he was on the verge of tears as his voice quivered. He seemed antsy; he had pronounced body movements and was constantly fidgeting around. The vehicleShekletski was driving was dirty. It was full of trash, debris and other items. The drivers floorboard itself had trash thrown on the floor. I observed a Q-Tip on the center console by the shift lever that appeared to have blood on it. It was unclear if it was from an injury visible on his lip or from another source. I also took note ofShekletskis appearance. He was wearing clean, neat clothes, but appeared out of place in comparison to the state of the vehicle.Shekletski was also very pale and thin. Based on my training, knowledge, and experience, I know that these can be indicators of criminal activity.  I askedShekletski why he was so worked up and he attributed it to his friend having passed away.Shekletski said that he was coming from Glenelg where there had been a celebration of life for his friend.  I inquired ifShekletskis license was revoked or suspended. He told me that he had gotten into trouble with a cop and that was the source of the license issue. When asked if he had gotten a DUI, Shekletskis response seemed evasive. He did not answer directly and said that he had fallen asleep. I continued to talk withShekletski to try and calm him down, as he still seemed very worked up.I have conducted thousands of motor vehicle stops in my 10 year law enforcement career. It is common for individuals to be nervous when contacted by the police. However, they generally calm down after a short period of time. Shekletski, however, continued to display the aforementioned observations.  I directedShekletski to remain in the vehicle. I went to the rear ofShekletskis car and watched him through the passenger side mirror to see what he would do. I also inquired about the availability of a CDS K9. Shortly thereafter I returned to my vehicle. I requested a return on the status ofShekletskis license. I learned that in addition to be flagged as ID only, his privilege was suspended and had been since late 2018. I was also notified that the Carroll County Sheriffs Department had a K9 working and would be directing them to respond to my location. BecauseShekletskis license was suspended, he was alone and the vehicle had no insurance, there was additional time to allow the K9 to respond. While in my vehicle I also confirmed that there had been a funeral service asShekletski had described to me.  I went back toShekletski. After explaining that he would not be going to jail for the license violations, I asked him to sit in my front seat so that we could continue to talk while I wrote some citations. This would serve multiple benefits, to include officer safety and logistical concerns, as I would need to obtain biographical information.Shekletski unbuckled and said something to the effect of Ill sit outside the car. I toldShekletski that he would be in the front seat and would not be in handcuffs.Shekletski agreed and walked over to my car. He then opened the door and got in as I got into the drivers seat.  I continued to talk toShekletski. He appeared extremely nervous despite every attempt for me to calm him down.Shekletski at times crossed his arms, tapped his foot or jumped his knee. I also observed him use his hand to cover his face and mouth at times. He continued to display the physical observations I witnessed to begin with. As I continued to talk he made comments about being caught and about ruining his life. His perceived severity of the situation did not match with how serious the situation was. I engaged in small talk withShekletski, talking about his family, his past and the like. Aside from motor vehicle related incidents,Shekletski denied having ever been in trouble and denied consuming any drugs beyond marijuana.  Eventually, I askedShekletski what was in the vehicle.Shekletski said that there was nothing in the car. I asked again andShekletski denied having anything in the vehicle. We went through that a couple of times before I explained that I had a police K9 coming. After explaining to him what might happen, I once again askedShekletski what was in the car. He finally admitted that he had a little cocaine in the vehicle. I asked what he meant by a little and he described that there was some powder in a folded up $1 bill.Shekletski also told me that he had a crushed up OxyContin pill in a folded up $1 bill. He described that they were in a compartment under the front drivers seat.  Deputy Whalen from the Sheriffs Department arrived to assist me. To expedite the process, I continued working on the paperwork I anticipated needed from the incident, including the criminal citations I intended to issue.  Master Deputy Ullrich and K9 Lazar arrived on scene shortly thereafter. After briefing M/Dep. Ullrich, he deployed K9 Lazar. I was notified that the dog altered for the presence of narcotics within the vehicle. A subsequent search of the vehicle yielded paraphernalia of drug use to include numerous cut straws with white powder residue. Additionally, I located two $1 bills, folded up, in the areaShekletski had identified. Both bills were folded into what I know by my training, knowledge, and experience as druggist folds, commonly used for the distribution of illegal drugs. Within one of the $1 bills, I observed a white powder substance consistent with cocaine. In the other, I located a blue powder consistent with a crushed OxyContin pill. The two bills were taken into evidence, the rest of the paraphernalia was left in the vehicle. The search was captured on my body worn camera.  Based on the facts and circumstances,Shekletski was issued citations for the observed traffic violations. Furthermore, he was issued criminal citations for the possession of controlled dangerous substances, one each for cocaine and OxyContin. He was also issued a notice to appear and a suspension pamphlet. I providedShekletski a courtesy ride home.  I request this case be closed.  All events occurred in Carroll County.</NarrativeText>
