Some of these sources are, but not limited to:      margin-left:8px; text-align:justify"&gt;Maryland State Troopers who live and/or work throughout the State of Maryland.    margin-left:8px; text-align:justify"&gt;Police Officers of allied agencies in the State of Maryland.    margin-left:8px; text-align:justify"&gt;Concerned citizens, who often times choose to remain anonymous, are conscientious enough to report occurrences of suspected criminal activity       CAMERAS:     margin-left:8px"&gt;TFC Carter  Dash Camera (utilized), In Car (utilized) and Body Worn (utilized)  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On Sunday, February 12, 2023 at approximately 0338 hours, I, TFC K. Carter #6361, was patrolling in the area of northbound I-270 at Park Mills Rd. when I observed a gray Volkswagen Atlas. The Volkswagens passengers side tires drifted just across the white solid line. It then jerked left and crossed over the broken white line, dividing lanes 1 and 2. After correcting back into lane 2, it again crossed the broken white line by a foot into lane 1. It then drifted straight to the solid line, jerking left upon touching it. Within the next 50 feet, it went from the white line to the broken white line then back to the white solid line. It traveled straight for approximately 50 feet before quickly drifting left across the broken line. The operator corrected back into lane 2, the Volkswagen was traveling at approximately the speed limit of 65 MPH. I then activated my emergency equipment and proceeded to stop the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas bearing Maryland registration 4EZ7595. It braked, slowing to approximately 40 MPH. The Volkswagens right turn signal came on then, continuing to travel for 100 feet before slowly pulling onto the right shoulder.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I made a drivers side approach, identified myself, the reason for the stop and that it was being audible and visually recorded. I detected the strong odor of marijuana emitting from the interior of the Volkswagen. The driver stated, I was just trying to get this dude home, and pointed at the passenger. I asked where they were coming from and the driver advised the club. I requested his license and registration card. I was able to identify him by his Maryland drivers license as Cristian Montano Bustamante (DOB 05/23/1991 H/M). I observed his eyes were glassy. I asked if he had anything to drink tonight. He stated, Nooooo, earlier before I went to the club, yeah. I then observed the Volkswagen was not in park, so I requested him to place it in park. After he put it park, I requested him turn the vehicle off. I again confirmed that he had drank an alcoholic beverage, and asked what time was his last drink. He took several seconds to respond and think, finally answering his last drink was around 2200 hours. I again requested the registration card, which he then obtained from the glove box. Montano then turned the vehicle back on. I requested him to turn the vehicle off and requested the keys. While he was speaking with me, his speech was slurred. I then returned to my patrol vehicle.   Upon returning to the Volkswagen, I requested Montano to exit and step to the front of his vehicle. He slowly stepped out of the vehicle, and paused upon standing up to keep his balance. I observed him sway side to side. I then was able to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I again instructed him to go to the front of his vehicle. As he walked around his door, he held onto it for support. He stopped at the front corner, with his hands behind his back as if he was going to be cuffed. I advised him we were going to perform some tests. He then stated that he didnt want to lie to me, that he had some drinks before going to the club. Montano then said, So I went, I went to the club. I thought I was going to be ok. But I know how much I drank. I asked how much he had to drink, he paused for 5 seconds then stated, Two beers.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  Field Sobriety was performed on the northbound I-270. I was again able to smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The light condition consisted of my flashlight; my spotlight, headlights, and forward face emergency equipment lights were turned off. His vehicle headlights were turned off. Montano was faced away from northbound traffic. The weather was clear and approximately 35 degrees with a mild wind. Montano appeared to be in good physical condition. He was wearing turtle neck, jacket, jeans and boots.  I asked Montano the following questions:     text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Glasses or contacts - None   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Medical Conditions - None   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Known Injuries - None   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Medications - None   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  I properly explained and demonstrated the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. I asked Montano if he understood the tests instructions and he stated, Yes.       text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Present in both eyes  Montano moved his head 5 times and didnt follow the pen a couple times. I instructed him not to move his head and follow the pen.  LACK OF CONVERGENCE  I properly explain and demonstrated the Lack of Convergence test. I asked Montano if he understood the tests instructions and he stated, Yes.     text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Montano eyes were able to converge.    WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed)  I properly explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn. I asked Montano if he understood the test and he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) During the instructional stage, Montano lost his balance once. I had to explain the test to him twice.  Walking stage (1st Nine): 1.) During the first 9 steps, Montano stepped off line on steps 2, 4 and 7. He stopped on steps 1-4 and 7-9. He missed heel to toe on steps 9, 10 and 11. He took a total of 11 steps.   Turn: 1.) Montano preformed the turn to satisfaction.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) During the second 9 steps, Montano stepped off line on steps 2, and 4-10. He stopped on steps 2, and 5-10. He began to count one thousand one on step 6, then stepped backwards to catch himself. He took a total of 10 steps. I asked him how many steps he took, he then stated a thousand seven.   ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed)  I properly explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand. I asked Montano if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Montano was attempting to start the test twice before I told him to begin.   Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: 1.) On seconds 0-10, I instructed him pick his foot up higher at second 4. He did by bending his leg, which I instructed him to straighten it.   Seconds 11-20: 1.)  On seconds 11-20, Montano put his foot down on second 19 and 20.   Seconds 21-30: 1.) On second 21-30, Montano put his foot down on second 25.   PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST  Montano was offered a preliminary breath test; in which he refused.  ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe that Montano was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:     text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Unable to maintain a lane of travel   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Slow to stop   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the driver breath   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Glassy eyes   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Slurred speech   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Slow and lethargic movements   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;Admission to drinking an alcoholic beverage prior to driving   text-align:justify; margin-left:8px"&gt;My observed sign of impairment during Field Sobriety   I arrested Montano for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0355 hours. He was placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. I played the DR-15 Advice of Rights English audio to Montano in its entirety. After it was completed I asked if he had any questions regarding the DR-15, to which he stated he understood. He REFUSED the intoximeter test at approximately 0412 hours. He was transported to the Frederick Barrack for processing. Once at Frederick Barrack, Montano signed the DR-15 form and REFUSED to the intoximeter test.  INTOXIMETER TEST  ****REFUSED THE INTOXIMETER TEST****  Montano was given all copies of pertinent paperwork, released to his friend at approximately 0504 hours  I am trained to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
