         <NarrativeText>DUI Folder # 23-96-343 SUSPECT: Ethan Paul Kalchthaler LICENSE # MD-10273765510 DUI CITATION # 42Q0VPH SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER: No ACCIDENT INVOLVED: No VIDEO: Maryland State Police; Axon Evidence Video ID #: 23MSP044023. BWC Utilized.  TROOPER CERTIFICATES / TRAINING  - I am trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). - I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of 2021. - I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020. - I have apprehended more than 100 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  NARRATIVE  -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION-  On 12-13-2023 at approximately 0018 hours, I (TFC Pinto #7212), was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating unmarked MSP vehicle V-9 traveling eastbound Maryland Route 50 west of Inlet Isle Lane, Ocean City, Maryland. At this time, I observed a white Volkswagen passenger car traveling westbound east of Inlet Isle Lane. I made the following observations on the same truck:  MD ROUTE 50 EAST OF INLET ISLE LANE  1. The vehicle appeared to be traveling above the maximum posted speed limit. I activated my Golden Eagle II radar unit (serial # DE-11799), in front opposite direction mode, and obtained a speed of 57 MPH in a posted 40 MPH Zone. The vehicle was the only vehicle in my front radar beam at the time the speed was obtained. The radar unit was tested before and after my tour of duty.  I safely conducted a U-turn at Inlet Isle Lane to travel westbound on Maryland Route 50 to get behind the white Volkswagen.  WESTBOUNT MD RT 50 BETWEEN INLET ISLE LANE AND GOLF COURSE ROAD   2. The vehicles rear brake light activated to slow down.   TRAFFIC STOP   I activated the emergency lights to my patrol vehicle, initiating a traffic stop on Maryland Route 50 east of Maryland Route 611. The vehicle was a white Volkswagen bearing Maryland Registration 3EM6101. The vehicle came to a stop on westbound Maryland Route 50 at Maryland Route 611.  -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT-  I made contact with the driver via the driver side door, and I immediately smelled thestrong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. The driver immediately handed me his drivers license. I explained the reason for the stop and requested the drivers registration card to the vehicle. The driver was identified as Ethan Paul Kalchthaler by his Maryland drivers license. While the driver and front seat passenger of the vehicle looked for the registration card, I asked Kalchthaler where he was traveling to, and he responded, Um just home to my house. I asked Kalchthaler where he was traveling from, and he replied:I just picked him up from Pickles. I asked Kalchthaler how much he had to drink at Pickles, and he advised:None.   As Kalchthaler spoke, I made the following observations:  1. I intentionally observed his eyes to beglassy and bloodshot.  2. He displayed aglazed look/expressionon his face as he interacted with me.  3. He avoided eye contact while I spoke to him.  4. I observed a green wristband on his right wrist. Due to my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, I know the wristband is given to costumers upon entry of drinking establishments to show they are 21 years of age or older.  I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks on Kalchthaler.  I later returned to the Volkswagen and requested Kalchthler exit the vehicle, and to walk to the sidewalk on the passenger side of his vehicle, to which he complied. While Kalchthaler excited the vehicle, I observed the following:  1. I observed his movements to be slow and lethargic.  2. I observed he removed his green pickles wristband from his right wrist and placed it in the drivers side door pocket.  3. I observed him use his left hand to grab the back-drivers side passenger door/ door jamb to keep his balance while exiting the vehicle.   While Kalchthaler walked to the sidewalk, I continued to speak with Kalchthaler. I advised him that I wanted to put him through Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to make sure he makes it home safely, due to me detecting the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle, I observed his Pickles wristband, and he admitted to traveling from Pickles. Kalchthaler stopped at the rear of his vehicle, and responded, Alright. I asked Kalchthaler again to step to the sidewalk, to which he complied. While on the sidewalk, I observed and asked Kalchthaler the following:  1. When I asked Kalchthaler a second time, how many alcoholic beverages he consumed this evening, he responded,Zero.  2. When asked if he was traveling from Pickles, Kalchthaler replied:Yea picking up my friend.  3. When asked at approximately what time he arrived at Pickles, Kalchthaler advised:Um, not sure, he called me, I woke up, and went to get him.  4. As Kalchthaler spoke, I smelled thestrong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  5. I observed Kalchthaler speech to be slow and spoke softly when answering questions.   -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING-  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs)  The evaluation was performed on the sidewalk. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight and street lamps. Weather was clear and approximately 30 degrees. I asked Kalchthaler if he has any physical disabilities, and he replied, No sir.. I asked Kalchthaler if he has any medical disabilities, and he responded, No sir. I asked Kalchthaler if he has any recent injuries, and he advised, No sir. I asked Kalchthaler if was currently on any medications, and he stated, No sir. I asked Kalchthaler if he wears glasses or contacts, and he replied, No sir. Kalchthaler appeared to be in general good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, limps, or any limb ailments.  Kalchthalerwas wearing a blue sweatshirt, gray pants, and black tennis shoes.  The first test given is the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. A pen was shown tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from eyes, slightly above eye level. Kalchthaler was instructed that he will look straight ahead at my pen, instructed to follow the pen with his eyes and eyes only, and keep his head and shoulders still. When asked if he understood the instructions, he replied,Yes sir. Kalchthaler had a ball cap on his head, and while being asked to turn it around for the test, he interrupted and asked, Am I allowed to plead the fifth? I advised Kalchthaler that I cannot force him to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, but he will be placed under arrest for driving under the influence based off my observations I have observed. Kalchthaler replied, Im just wondering, I was picking up my friend. I explain to Kalchthaler that if he conducts Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, it gives him the opportunity to prove that he is not driving while under the influence of alcohol and that if he has not consumed any alcoholic beverages like he stated, then he shouldnt show any signs of impairment. I asked Kalchthaler if he wanted to conduct the tests, and he responded, Im gonna plead the fifth. I asked Kalchthaler three more times if he wanted to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests or not, and he stated, I plead the fifth, each time.   ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Kalchthaler was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  * Driving vehicle above the maximum posted speed limit (57MPH in a 35 MPH Zone). * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Glazed look/expression on face. * Speech slow.  * Admitted to be traveling from a restaurant/ bar that serves alcohol. * Wearing a wristband given to costumers upon entry of drinking establishments to show they are 21 years of age or older. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person..  I determined that Kalchthaler was impaired by the presence of an alcoholic beverage in his system that adversely affected his ability to operate a motor vehicle. I placed Kalchthaler under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0027 hours on 12-13-2023.  ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)  Kalchthaler was placed and secured in the right front seat of my patrol vehicle. Kalchthaler was given his Advice of Rights via the audio version of the DR-15 Form (played through the patrol vehicles laptop speakers). A copy of the DR-15 Form was placed directly in front of Kalchthaler, in his lap. At the conclusion of the audio version, I verbally asked him if wanted to submit to the intoximeter test, and he responded, I plead the fifth. I advised Kalchthaler if he is going to continue to state that he pleads the fifth it will be marked as a refusal. Kalchthaler continued to state that he pleads the fifth. At approximately 0041 hours, on 12-13-23, Kalchthaler refused to submit to a breath test.  TRANSPORT   Kalchthaler was subsequently transported to the Berlin Barrack for processing. While en route, I continued to smell thestrong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Kalchthalers breath and person. Also, while en route, Kalchthaler asked for water, and I advised him once we arrived at the barrack I can provide him with water.  While at the Barrack, Kalchthaler requested water on three occasions, and was provided with water on two of those three occasions.  PROCESSING / RELEASE  While at the Barrack, Kalchthaler requested water on two occasions, and was provided with water on two of those three occasions.  There was adistinct and strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the processing room. The odor was not present before Kalchthaler entered. Kalchthaler refused to sign any documents and advised he plead the fifth.  Kalchthaler was provided all forms and citations prior to his release.  CHARGES  Kalchthaler was charged with the following citations:  1. Driving Vehicle While Under The Influence Of Alcohol (42Q0VPH) 2. Driving Vehicle While Impaired By Alcohol (42R0VPH) 3. Negligent Driving (42S0VPH) 4. Reckless Driving (42T0VPH) 5. Exceeding Posted Maximum Speed Limit: 57 MPH in a Posted 40 MPH Zone (42V0VPH) 6.
