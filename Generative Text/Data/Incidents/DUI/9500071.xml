         <NarrativeText>Alcohol Influence Report Patrol Vehicle Information  I-26 (Marked). I was equipped with a BWC (Body Worn Camera) only.  Defendant: Lopez Rivera, Genry Alex Date of Birth: 11/15/2001 Date of Arrest: 06/14/2023 Time of stop: 0036 Time of Arrest: 0103 Maryland SDX: MD10273074244 License Status  Expired License Restrictions  AJU Registration Violations  Failing to display registration card upon demand  Officers Training/Experience * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Anne Arundel County Police Department, Maryland State Police Department, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police Department * Certified Drug Recognition Expert since 2017 * Graduate of the University of Maryland DUI Institute 2019 *2023 Frederick Police Department Green Lab  *Repeat Offender* - NO  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On 6/13/2023 at approximately 0036 hours, I was conducting a patrol check, in the town of Marydel, Caroline County Maryland. I was traveling north on Main Street, approaching Halltown Road, when I observed a truck traveling behind me. I could see the head lights of the truck, activated, in my rear and driver side view mirror. The truck was traveling north on Main Street, in the south bound lane, approaching my vehicle. I made a right hand turn into the shoulder of Halltown Road, in an effort to make observations on this truck, which was later identified as a black 2015 Chevrolet Silverado displaying Maryland registration 50523CK. The Silverado was towing a 2019 BRIM trailer with Maryland registration 392480X. I observed the truck and trailer make a left onto Halltown Road, heading south. I could see that the trailer had no activated taillights as it began traveling south on Halltown Road, towards Temple Road. I turned around and began following the Chevrolet. I observed it make a right turn, onto Lepore Road. As it turned, I could see its brake lights activate. After it turned onto Lepore Road, more than half of the truck was in the opposite lane, crossing over the double yellow lines separating both travel lanes. I could see that the rear registration plate of the trailer was not illuminated. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle, after turning onto Lepore Road. The Chevrolet came to a slow stop, in the middle of the travel lane, into Walkers Trailer Park, located at 18240 Lepore Road.    PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the driver side B pillar of the vehicle and made contact with the driver/sole occupant, who was later positively identified via his Maryland drivers license as Genry Alex Lopez Rivera (H/M, DOB: 11/15/2001). While standing next to Genry, I could see in the passenger seat, directly behind him, a 6-pack of what appeared to be empty beer bottles, still in the box. I could also see another empty beer bottle on the front passenger floor board. I informed Genry about the taillights being inoperative and asked where he was coming from. Genry mumbled under his breath, saying, Delaware. Genry was asked to provide me with his license. I could see Genrys shirt had a purplish pink and chunky stain on it, on the upper middle chest area, which appeared to be throw up. I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from within the vehicle. Genry also had bloodshot and droopy eyes. Genry was asked to provide the registration as well. Genry began fumbling through several documents within the vehicle. Genry was asked again to provide the registration. Genry then handed me a document that was not the registration. Genry was asked to step out of the vehicle. Genry complied as he stepped out. Genry was asked about weapons. Genry then stated no and reached for his pockets. A brief pat-down was conducted for officer safety. I could see Genrys fly was half way down. Genry was asked to come to the rear of his vehicle and speak with me. Genry had a drunk like walk back to the rear of his vehicle. Genry was asked where specifically he was coming from. Genry replied, he was coming from a friends house in Delaware. Genry stated that his friend was having a barbeque and he had consumed three beers. Genry informed me that he speaks English good. Genry stated he had consumed the three beers about 20 minutes ago. Genry was asked, and agreed to conduct standardized field sobriety tests.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  Genry was wearing jeans with a black t-shirt and brown boots. Genry was asked and stated he was not sick or injured. Genry stated that he did not have contacts and did not need glasses to see. Genry stated he was not diabetic or epileptic. Genry stated he has not taken any medications today. Genry stated he has not taken any drugs.  Genry again confirmed with me, that he had only drank like three beers.  Prior to any testing, my overhead forward flashing lights were deactivated. The weather was clear with minimal wind. While speaking with me outside of his car, directly in front of me, I could now smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath.    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The red light of my pen was used as the stimulus, and held approximately 12 inches from Genrys eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Genrys pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting Nystagmus. When asked, Genry stated that he understood the instructions.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Vertical Nystagmus  Not present  Observation: N/A   WALK AND TURN (3/8 clues observed)  Prior to Genry performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Genry was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. He was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. He was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, he was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Genry was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. He was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. After providing the instructions, Genry stated he understood.  Instructional Stage: - Failed to maintain instructional stance.   Walking Stage (1st Nine): None observed                                             Turn : Incorrect, failing to utilize his back foot to take a series of steps to turn around, instead, pivoting with both feet planted.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): -took 10 steps                        Observation: Counted out loud to 10 steps on the first nine, however, because he counted, his step, back into the instructional stage, he actually took the correct number of steps. Genry swayed on multiple steps.   ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed)  Prior to Genry performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. After explaining the test, Genry stated that he understood.  Instructional Stage: Remained as demonstrated  Balance and Count Stage:  -swayed while balancing                       -puts foot down after two seconds.   Observation: Genry was observed to be staring straight ahead with his hands in his pockets. Genry was reminded to look at his feet and to take his hands out of his pockets and down by his sides.                                        PBT was offered and refused.    ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Genry was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol  -6/6 HGN -3/8 WAT -2/4 OLS -Throw up stain on shirt -disheveled appearance -fumbling through documents -failure to locate and retrieve registration -drunk like gait -bloodshot eyes and droopy eyelids -Impaired memory (taking 10 steps when asked to take 9) -open and empty alcoholic beverages observed within the vehicle in plain view -Poor balance and coordination during SFSTs -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from breath -Admitted to drinking alcohol prior to operating his motor vehicle -Several moving violations observed prior to traffic stop   Due to the number of observations, I concluded Genry was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. I placed Genry under arrest at 0103 hours. Genry was placed in handcuffs and seated in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. Genrys vehicle was removed from the roadway by the owner.   Genry was read aloud the DR-15 Advice of Rights form using the MVA audio file. Genry was also provided the form to read along with. Genry was asked which version, he would like. Genry informed me that English version was ok. After listening to his rights, Genry agreed to submit to the alcohol concentration test. I responded to the Caroline County Sheriffs Office, where Sgt. Nagyiski #2501 conducted the breath test. Genrys bareath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. A MSP form #33 was completed.  Genrys license status at the time of this incident was expired. A DR-15A form was completed and Genry was issued a temporary license. Genry was provided with his copies of the MVA related forms, and his traffic citations.   Genry was issued the following traffic citations: driving vehicle under the influence of alcohol, driving vehicle while impaired by alcohol, driving under the influence of alcohol per se, negligent driving, reckless driving, failure to drive on right half of roadway, driver changing lanes when unsafe, driving vehicle with an expired license, failure to display registration card upon demand, failure to display and reflect red color light on rear lamps and reflectors, and driving vehicle with inadequate arear registration plate illumination. A sober driver responded to the Denton Detachment and took control of Genry with no further incident.  All events occurred in Caroline County, Maryland.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: .14  </NarrativeText>
