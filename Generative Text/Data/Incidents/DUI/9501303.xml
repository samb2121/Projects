         <NarrativeText>Incident recorded on marked MSP patrol vehicle P-26s in-car-camera and Body-worn camera. DUI NARRATIVE Nathaniel Hitch 7051  DUI INFORMATION Defendant:SCHULTZ, BRANDON LEE Date of Birth: 12/27/1994 License Number: Maryland - MD10273123687 Date of Arrest: 12/21/2023 CC#: 23-MSP-045017 (Glen Burnie Barrack) Time of arrest: 0038 hours.  Training and Awards NHTSA Certified Standardized Field Sobriety Instructor Recipient of the Maryland Highway Safety Offices DUI award for 2021 and 2022. Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trained in administering the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trained in A.R.I.D.E. (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Attended the MSP Enhanced DUI class provided through the Maryland State Police SPIDRE Team. Attendee of the 2022 Ocean City DUI conference.  Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1) On 12/21/2023 at approximately 0020 hours I, TFC. Hitch #7051 was on duty traveling Westbound on Dorsey Road in Anne Arundel County. At that time, I observed a White Tesla Model S bearing a Maryland registration plate of 3FA5304 traveling Eastbound on Dorsey Rd prior to Aviation Blvd. I observed that the Tesla appeared to be crossing over the lanes lines and that it was pressing on its brakes at random moments. I turned around and observed the following traffic infractions and impaired driving indicators:   The Teslas front and rear drivers side tires crossed over the dotted white line by approximately half a tires width.  The Tesla then swerved to its right causing its front and rear passenger side tires to cross over the solid white shoulder line by approximately a tires width.  The Teslas drivers side tires crossed the dotted white line again in a similar manner as before.     These first three infractions occurred within a 10 second period.      The Tesla took the ramp for southbound I-97, sped up significantly, and crossed over the solid white gore area line with its front/rear drivers side tires.  The Tesla then took the ramp from S/B I-97 onto eastbound Route 100. As it did so, its drivers side tires crossed the solid yellow line on two (2) occasions.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Throughout this period of time, the Tesla would press on its brakes at random intervals and would vary its speed randomly.  Based on the aforementioned traffic violations and impairment clues, I conducted a traffic stop on the Tesla. The Tesla stopped on eastbound Route 100 at I-97. Personal Contact (Phase 2)  I made contact with the operator of the Tesla. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as SCHULTZ, BRANDON LEE (MD  MD10273123687; DOB  12/27/1994; Schultz/Male). Immediately upon approaching the Tesla, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I advised Schultz of the reason for the traffic stop and requested a drivers license and vehicle registration. Schultz provided both.  Schultz advised me that the reason he had been crossing the lane lines was due to the Teslas autopilot. As I spoke with Schultz, I observed that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and he had tobacco in his mouth. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks. I then returned to Schultz and requested that he step out of his vehicle, Schultz complied. Schultz walked to the front of his vehicle per my request. As Schultz did so, the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanated off his breath and person and travelled with him as he walked.  I asked Schultz how much he had to drink that night, Schultz stated he had drank three or four drinks over the course of four hours. Schultz stated his last drink was approximately 45 minutes ago  Based on Schultz driving infractions, the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from him, his admission to drinking, and his bloodshot and glassy eyes I suspected that Schultz was under the influence of an intoxicating substance. I requested that Schultz perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, he submitted.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3) The evaluation was performed in front of Schultzs vehicle. The evaluation was lit by roadside lighting and my flashlight. The evaluation was performed on a flat, dry, and debris-free surface. I asked Schultz the basic medical questions as they relate to the Standardized Field Sobriety Test. His answers are located in the below text: Are you wearing contacts  No. Do you have any head, neck, back, or leg injuries  No. Do you take any medications  No. Do you have any medical issues  No.  The weather conditions were cold and dry. Schultz appeared to be in good physical condition.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Schultzs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes. Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not observed.   Walk and Turn (4/8)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Schultz affirmed that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Phase:  Unable to maintain balance. Schultz broke from the instructional position immediately after stepping into the position. Then as I was explaining the test, Schultz broke the instructional position again because he was not able to maintain his balance. First 9 steps:  Nothing to report. Turn:  Completed unsatisfactorily. Swiveled around backwards using both feet to turn.  Second 9 Steps: Stepped off line on step 3 Missed heel-to-toe on step 7.   One Leg Stand (1/4). The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Schultz affirmed that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Schultz raised his left foot.   First 10 seconds  Nothing to report Second 10 seconds  Nothing to report Third 10 seconds  Hopped in place  PBT Test Refused  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Schultz was driving a motor vehicle Under the Influence of Alcohol.  * Schultzs driving infractions. *Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. *Glassy and bloodshot eyes. *Admission to drinking that night. *Indications of impairment based on his SFST results.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: 0038  INTOXIMETER RESULTS: 0.08.  CHARGES Charges are attached to report.   Schultz was placed under arrest at approximately 0038 hours. He was read the DR-15 advice of rights using the online recording. Schultz submitted to the Intoximeter test. Cpl. Wiest #0131 conducted the test and Schultz had a result of 0.08 BrAC. Schultz was picked up by a sober driver and released from the Glen Burnie Barrack. Schultz was extremely polite and cooperative with me throughout my entire interaction with him, and appeared to be going through a difficult period in his life. All events occurred in Anne Arundel County Maryland.  Case Closed by Arrest. </NarrativeText>
