         <NarrativeText>  On 6/22/2023 at approximately 1930 hours, M/Tpr. Hood and Sgt. Roberts with the Western Region Investigations Section were patrolling in the area of Johnathan Street and Church Street located in Hagerstown City Maryland. M/Tpr. Hood knows due to his training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and his time working within Hagerstown City limits that this area is a high drug trafficking area and consistently occupied by subjects selling street level narcotics. M/Tpr. Hood and Sgt. Roberts observed a dark blue Honda Accord bearing West Virginia registration in the area and make contact with an unknown black male on foot. The interaction was very short and appeared to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction. M/Tpr. Hood was able to identify the interaction as a hand-to-hand drug transaction due to his training and experience as a narcotics investigator. M/Tpr. Hood is also familiar with the interaction due to his involvement in completing several hand-to-hand drug transactions while acting in a undercover, purchasing illegal narcotics. Due to the observations made M/Tpr. Hood and Sgt. Roberts followed the blue Honda to the area of Nottingham Road and Church Street.  The Blue Honda failed to obtain its lane and drove over the solid yellow center line. Due to the traffic violation Sgt. Roberts conducted a traffic stop utilizing CE-17 and the Honda parked on the right shoulder of the roadway. Upon making contact with the driver Sgt. Roberts made contact with the male driver identified as Kenneth Michael Hensley 2/M DOB 1/27/1987. M/Tpr. Hood made a passenger side approach and made contact with the front passenger identified as Bessie Catherine Freeman 2/F DOB 11/25/1986. While making contact with Freeman, M/Tpr. Hood observed her making sudden movements around her pants line on the left side. M/Tpr. Hood told Freeman to exit the vehicle and asked her what she was shoving in her pants, due to the unknown factor of potential weapons. Freeman then stated, this is all I have and retrieved a glass smoking device from her waistband. M/Tpr. Hood was able to identify the smoking device as a crack pipe used to smoke crack cocaine. M/Tpr. Hood was able to identify the smoking device as such due to his training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. At this time, Sgt. Roberts asked Hensley the driver to exit the vehicle and Hensley was asked if he was in possession of any weapons or illegal contraband. Hensley then stated, might as well give it to him while talking to Freeman. Freeman then reached on the right side of her pants and pulled out a plastic trash can containing a white rock substance. Due to M/Tpr. Hoods training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper he was able to determine the substance to be suspected crack cocaine.  No other contraband was found on Freeman at this time, however Hensley was in possession of 7.5 blue pills. Due to Sgt. Roberts training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper he was able to determine the pills found on Hensleys person were in fact suspected fentanyl pills. Also located on Hensley was two more trash cans containing trace amounts of a unknown substance. No other items were located on Hensley at this time. Hensley and Freeman were both advised of their Miranda rights by M/Tpr. Hood and both waived their right to council. Both Hensley and Freeman were cooperative and further investigation will be pending.  All the property was transported to the Hagerstown State Police Barracks for processing where it was documented on a MSP PH# 343956 and MSP form 67.  All the above events occurred in Washington County Maryland. </NarrativeText>
