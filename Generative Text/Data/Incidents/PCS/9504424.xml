         <NarrativeText>Crime:  Possession of CDS  not marijuana  Scene processing:  Located CDS was processed and placed in storage in accordance with Maryland State Police Policy (P-345720)  Attachments:  Chain of Custody, Property Held, and Miranda Form.  Suspect/ Offender:  Kevin Paul Knode (DOB:04/18/1986) W/M 5603 Mount Holly Road, East New Market, Dorchester County, Maryland 21631 Phone Number: (443) 521-6956  Video:  Body Camera: https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=ed5995c0af8048a4a639d74c7613d624partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  Front Camera: https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=e91c96d798844a4593dd92efb5450c0epartner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  Rear Camera: https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=7e433ea7882243a1810b56899d63bcf2partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  Narrative:   My body worn camera and in-car camera were both active and recording during this encounter.  On 09/21/2023 at approximately 0930 hours I, TFC Honsinger, was conducting speed enforcement in the area of Ocean Gateway and Old Bradley Road, Mardela Springs, Maryland 21837 in my unmarked patrol vehicle. While at that intersection, I observed a gold Chevrolet Trailblazer bearing Maryland registration 7Z7252 that appeared to be traveling above the posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour. I am trained by the Maryland State Police in the use of LIDAR to obtain vehicle speeds, and my equipment was tested prior to and after tour of duty and found to be in working order. I activated my LIDAR device and obtained a speed of 78 miles per hour at 460 feet. I observed the driver quickly apply the brakes and make a sharp turn onto Old Bradley Drive. I turned around from my stationary position, activated my emergency equipment, and conducted a traffic stop. Once the vehicle pulled to the right shoulder, I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the drivers side of the vehicle. Upon my approach, I observed two white males sitting in the front drivers seat and front passenger seat of the vehicle. I made contact with the driver of the vehicle, identified myself, the reason for the traffic stop, and the stop was being audibly and visually recorded. The driver later identified as Kevin Paul Knode (hereinafter referred to as Kevin) by his Maryland identification card, stated he did not have his license because its suspended. I asked for Kevins ID card and he produced two containers containing medical marijuana. I told Kevin I did not need his marijuana as it is prescribed to him and he has a Maryland Medical Marijuana Card. Due to Kevin not having a valid license I asked the front passenger for his name and date of birth and he advised Johnathon Truitt and his DOB: 07/05/1991 (hereinafter referred to as Truitt).  I returned to my vehicle and conducted license and wanted checks on both of the occupants. I was advised Kevin is suspended and revoked and his wanted check was negative. I was also advised Truitts wanted check was negative, but he was not able to locate him in the MVA. I observed Kevin to be holding his registration card inside of his vehicle. I asked Kevin to step out of the vehicle to bring the registration card to which he complied. As Kevin exited the vehicle a white piece of paper fell out of his right hand and onto the asphalt. I picked up the piece of wax paper and I observed it to be a wax fold containing suspected heroin, and stamped ensure. Upon locating the narcotics, I called for additional units and detained the driver.  Once additional units arrived on scene, I ordered Truitt out of the vehicle, and conducted a probable cause search of the vehicle. During the search of the vehicle I located pieces of steel wool (also known as Chore Boy) scattered though out the vehicle. While searching the passenger side of the vehicle I located a large piece of steel wool that had burn marks consistent with being used to smoke crack cocaine. No other evidence of a crime was located inside of the vehicle. I searched Truitt and found pieces of steel wool in his right pocket but no other evidence of a crime. Kevin was searched on scene and initially no other evidence of a crime was located. I am trained by the Maryland State Police in the use, packaging, and detection of controlled dangerous substances, and based on my training, knowledge and experience I was able to identify the powder in the wax fold as Heroin, and the steel wool as drug paraphernalia consistent with the use of crack cocaine.  Kevin was placed under arrest and was placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle to be taken to the Salisbury Barrack to be processed.  Once at the Salisbury Barrack, I brought Kevin inside and conducted a secondary search of Kevin. While conducting the search, I felt a rectangular bulge in the front of his pants during the search and asked Kevin what it was. At first he attempted to state it was his testicles but admitted it was crack cocaine. Based on my training, knowledge, and experience I was able to determine the white rock like substance was crack cocaine. I removed the crack cocaine from his groin area and brought Kevin to the holding cell to conduct a strip search approved by the duty officer SGT Mareck. At 1033 hours, I remained in the doorway of the holding cell, and SGT Mareck was in the hallway as I conducted a strip search of Kevin. Located between Kevins testicles and legs were six additional wax folds containing suspected heroin. Also located was one hypodermic syringe that fell out of the Kevins underwear during the search. Kevin took a seat on the bench in the holding cell and made the voluntary statement, the heroin was for personal use.  The located CDS was processed and placed into property per Maryland State Police policy (P-345720). Kevin was processed, charged under two criminal citations, and release on his own personal recognizance.  All events occurred in Wicomico County, Maryland.  Case Closed by ARREST </NarrativeText>
