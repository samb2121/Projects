         <NarrativeText>J-07 is equipped with dash cam and BWC. This entire incident was recorded.  Defendant: Luke Albert Stoltzmann Date of Birth: 10/12/1993 Date of Arrest: 05/13/2023 Time of Arrest: 1542 hours Maryland SDX: S-343-560-041-785 DUI #: J-23-077  ***SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER***  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING: * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Apprehended more than 170 impaired drivers during my career with the Maryland State Police to date. *ARIDE (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement)  *VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):  On Saturday, May 13, 2023, at approximately 1530 hours, I, TFC. Lowe #6739, was in uniform of the day, operating unmarked MSP vehicle, J-7. At that time, I was in the area of E/B Rt. 50 and Cape St. Claire Rd., Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, MD 21401. I was leaving an accident scene, when a lookout was broadcasted that a male in a blue passenger vehicle was asleep behind the wheel in heavy traffic. Cpl. Anderson #6354 and I headed that direction. A few moments later, we both observed a small, blue passenger car sitting in lane 3 in the area of E/B Rt. 50 and Whitehall Road. I observed the vehicle to be a blue Chevrolet Cruze bearing Maryland registration, 9EX0450. Cpl. Anderson exited his vehicle and tapped on the passenger side window to wake the driver, who was actively passed out behind the wheel with his head against the headrest. Since there was heavy traffic and the vehicle was in the roadway, Cpl. Anderson asked the male driver to pull his vehicle over to the right shoulder, out of the roadway. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):   Once the vehicle was on the shoulder, I made contact with the driver. The male put his window down and handed me his license. I identified the driver by his Maryland drivers license as, Luke Albert Stoltzmann, W/M, DOB: 10/12/1993 (hereinafter referred to as Stoltzmann.) I asked Stoltzmann why he was asleep in the roadway, and he stated, Im tired, I had a long night last night. I asked Stoltzmann where he was heading, and he advised, Home. I asked where he was coming from, and he stated, My friends house. Stoltzmann continued to talk with Cpl. Anderson. I noticed that Stoltzmanns pupils were abnormally constricted, his lips were dry, and his eyelids were droopy. After, I asked Stoltzmann if he had consumed any drugs or alcohol prior to driving to which he responded, no. At this time, EMS was on scene. They talked to Stoltzmann to ensure he was okay and did not need any medical attention. Stoltzmann declined medical attention. To make sure Stoltzmann was okay to drive, I requested Stoltzmann to exit his vehicle. He complied and walked to the rear of his vehicle as instructed. I asked Stoltzmann if he would complete a few field sobriety tests, and he agreed.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  I asked Stoltzmann the following questions: Injuries  None Medication  Methadone which he took that morning. Medical Conditions  None Glasses/Contacts  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test that was given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. Stoltzmann stated he understood the instructions.Stoltzmann displayed the following clues:   1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  Modified Romberg Balance Test Stoltzmann was advised to tilt his head back, close his eyes, and estimate the passage of 30 seconds. Once he was finished counting he was to lift his head so that I knew he was finished counting. Stoltzmann closed his eyes and counted for a total of 49 seconds.  WALK AND TURN (1/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA manual. Stoltzmann stated he understood the instructions. Stoltzmann displayed the following clues:  Instructional Stage:  -Nothing to report.  Walking Stage (1st nine) : 1. Missed heel-to-toe by stepping on his foot on steps 3 and 7. - I observed Stoltzmann kick his heel on step 9.   ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA manual.Stoltzmann stated he understood the instructions.Stoltzmann displayed the following clues:  1. Swayed on counts 1008, 1020-1025, and 1028-1030.   After the tests, I asked Stoltzmann if there was anything in the vehicle I needed to know about. He stated, No. S/Tpr. Matthews #5973, who was assisting me on scene observed possible CDS in the drivers side door handle and asked Stoltzmann what the clear capsule was. Stoltzmann stated that it was a Kratom pill he got from a gas station. Stoltzmann was asked where the packaging for the pill was, and he stated he didnt know. I retrieved the capsule from the door handle.   ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Stoltzmann was driving a motor vehicle while impaired by CDS: * Abnormally constricted pupils * Clues during standardized field sobriety  Stoltzmann was arrested for DWI at approximately 1542 hours. The vehicle was towed from the scene by Marc Bowen Towing. Stoltzmann was then transported to the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack for processing. The CDS was placed in a box to be packaged at the Barrack. On the ride to the barrack, Stoltzmann was nodding in and out. Once at the barrack, I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Stoltzmann via MVA English audio. While the Dr-15 was being played, Stoltzmann was on the nod, leaning forward on the bench, nodding in and out, dropping his DR-15 copy he was given to read over several times. After the recording was over, I asked Stoltzmann if he would like to submit to the Intoximeter test which he agreed at 1620 hours with a result of .00.After receiving the breath test results, I determined that the results were not consistent with the level of impairment that was observed. S/Tpr. Matthews, a certified Drug Recognition Expert, responded to the Barrack at 1700 hours. S/Tpr. Matthews went over the 12 step NHTSA/IACP test and at 1708 hours, Stoltzmann refused to submit to the evaluation. S/Tpr. Matthews advised Stotlzmann of his Miranda rights which he chose to invoke. Stoltzmann did state at the barrack that he did not know what was in the clear capsule. However, at 1717 hours, Stoltzmann agreed to submit to a blood test. While completing paperwork, I continued to observe Stoltzmann nod in and out and his movements became slow and lethargic. Stoltzmann was transported to Anne Arundel Medical Center for the blood draw. Emily Bonner, a nurse at AAMC, conducted the blood draw. After, Stoltzmann was then transported to Jennifer Road Detention Center for processing. Stoltzmann was taken to complete the thermal body scan, once in the room, OFC. Moon #438, a correctional officer at the detention center, observed a clear baggie of clear capsules fall from Stoltzmanns shorts. Oc. Moon handed me the baggie. Stoltzmann was charged accordingly.  The CDS was packaged per MSP policy and placed on Property Recordp-334046. The total count of capsules was 48 clear capsules filled with a white, powdery substance.  On May 12, 2023, TFC. Jeans #6483 arrested Stoltzmann for DUI of CDS.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  Case open pending lab results.</NarrativeText>

SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE: Drug Influence Evaluation Report  DRE: S/TPR Shawn Matthews #5973 DRE #: 30407 DRE Rolling Log #: 23-03-0108 Evaluator Agency: Maryland State Police, Annapolis Barrack  610 Taylor Avenue, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland  Arresting Officer: TFC E. Lowe #6739 Requesting Agency: Maryland State Police, Annapolis Barrack  610 Taylor Avenue, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland  Agency Case #: 23MSP017090 DUI Citation #: PENDING  Subjects Name: Luke Albert Stoltzmann Birth Date: 10/12/1993 Drivers License Information: S-343-560-041785  Date of this Report: 05/14/2023 Date of Evaluation: 05/13/2023 Date of Arrest: 05/13/2023 Time of Arrest: 1542 hours Evaluation Start Time: 1647 hours Evaluation Refusal Time: 1708 hours Blood Kit Completion Time: 1820 hours Blood Kit #: J-83  LOCATION OF EVALUATION: This evaluation was conducted at the Maryland State Police, Annapolis Barrack, located at 610 Taylor Avenue, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The psychophysical tests were administered in the Troopers Room of the Barrack. The room was well lit. The floor consisted of carpeted flooring which was dry, level, and free of debris.  WITNESSES: The evaluation was audibly and visually recorded on my Axon Body Worn Camera.   EVALUATION:      Breath Alcohol Test:     Stoltzmann was administered the Intoximeter Breath Test, Instrument #011810, at the Maryland State Police, Annapolis Barrack, with a result of 0.00 BrAC, at 1632 hours.      Interview of Arresting Officer / DRES Personal Observation:        PHASE ONE - VEHICLE IN MOTION:   On 05/13/2023, at approximately 1530 hours, TFC E. Lowe #6739, responded to the area of eastbound U.S. Route 50, west of Exit 31 (Whitehall Road), Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, for a report of a driver unconscious in the drivers seat of a blue passenger car, in Lane 2. TFC Lowe located the vehicle, a blue Chevrolet, and made contact with the driver, later identified by his Maryland drivers license as Luke Albert Stoltzmann, W/M, DOB: 10/12/1993.    PHASE TWO - PERSONAL CONTACT / PHASE THREE  PREARREST SCREENING  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs):  Stoltzmann was unconscious on scene. TFC Lowe woke Stoltzmann up and had him move his vehicle to the right shoulder of the roadway because there was heavy traffic at the time. TFC Lowe requested Stoltzmann exit the vehicle so that she could administer a series of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to him. He consented to submit to the tests. I S/TPR S. Matthews #5973, a trained and certified Drug Recognition Expert, responded to the scene to assist with the traffic stop. Upon my arrival, I observed Stoltzmann standing at the rear his vehicle as TFC Lowe was speaking to him and administering him the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. He appeared drowsy and tired. His skin appeared pale. Stoltzmanns face was droopy and his eyelids were droopy. TFC Lowe then administered the Modified Romberg Balance Test to Stoltzmann. I observed Stoltzmann was noticeably swaying in a circular motion. I observed his legs were tremoring (body tremors). I walked to the passengers side of the Chevrolet and looked into the interior of the vehicle to see if there was any controlled dangerous substances or contraband in plain view. I walked around to the drivers side door and looked into the vehicle again. I could see down into the drivers side door handle pocket. I observed a clear capsule containing white powder, suspected Fentanyl, and other controlled dangerous substances.    I recognized the capsule as suspected CDS/drugs from my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, and as a trained and certified Drug Recognition Expert. I know that CDS is commonly packaged in clear gelatin capsules and can contain a mix of different types and categories of drugs and/or controlled dangerous substances, which is known as a scramble pill. I was trained at the Maryland State Police Academy in 2011. During that time, I was familiarized with various types of CDS/drugs, and associated CDS paraphernalia. I have also made numerous arrests for possession of CDS/drugs, and CDS paraphernalia.    I documented the capsule on my Axon Body Worn Camera (Timestamp 3:16). I informed TFC Lowe of the suspected CDS in plain view, by writing a note for her to read on an index card, as she was speaking with Stoltzmann.   TFC Lowe then administered the One Leg Stand Test to Stoltzmann. After the test was completed, TFC Lowe asked Stoltzmann if there was anything in the vehicle that she should know about. Stoltzmann advised there was not. I asked Stoltzmann what the capsule containing white powder was. He stated it was Kratom. I know that Kratom is an herbal supplement which can have effects similar to that of a CNS Stimulant or a Narcotic Analgesic; depending on dosage. Kratom commonly is a green or brown powder, not a white powder, which is ground from the leaves of a plant, and contains the suspected psychoactive chemical mitragynine. I know from my training, knowledge, and experience that opioid addicts use Kratom because it is known to relieve cravings for opioids, and is easily purchased from convenience stores. Stoltzmann stated he also takes methadone (Narcotic Analgesic drug). He stated he purchased The capsule from a gas station in Denton. He sated he did not have the packaging for the Kratom capsule in the car. Stoltzmann had said that he was coming from Baltimore City; where he could easily purchase scramble pills. I did not believe the capsule contained Kratom powder. However, I know that Kratom is also a drug, not a scheduled controlled substance, which can impair a persons ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. I did not detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage on Stoltzmanns breath as I spoke with him outside of his vehicle. I observed his pupils appeared abnormally constricted in daylight.    ARREST:  TFC Lowe placed Stoltzmann under arrest for suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs and/or controlled dangerous substances and for CDS  Possession Not Cannabis, at approximately 1542 hours. TFC Lowe conduced a search of the Chevrolet and recovered the suspected CDS and CDS paraphernalia from the drivers side door pocket. I conducted a search of Stoltzmann. I observed he was wearing two pairs of shorts and boxer shorts. A search of his person was negative at the scene. I secured Stoltzmannin the front seat of TFC Lowes patrol car.    PROCESSING: TFC Lowe advised Stoltzmann of his DR-15, Advice of Rights. He consented to submit to the Intoximeter Breath Test, with a result of 0.00 BrAC, at approximately 1632 hours.   TFC Lowe observed Stoltzmanns breath test result was not consistent with his breath test result. She requested that I speak with Stoltzmann and offer him a 12-step IACP/NHTSA approved Drug Influence Evaluation.   I arrived at the Barrack and spoke with TFC Lowe at 1647 hours. She advised me that she observed Stoltzmann displayed HGN Test: 6/6 validated clues; MRB Test: 30 seconds estimated when 49 seconds elapsed (slow internal clock), and Stoltzmann was swaying unsteadily; WAT Test: 0/8 validated clues; and OLS Test: 2/4 validated clues. Also Stoltzmann was on the nod as she was transporting him back to the Barrack for processing. She stated Stoltsmanns pupils appeared abnormally constricted on the road side.   I observed Stoltzmann was also heavily on the nod as he was seated on the bench in the Troopers Room of the Barrack. His mouth hung wide open, and he slowly slumped forward as he sat on the wooden bench, with his left hand handcuffed to a metal rail, mounted to the wall. When he was not interacted with, he slowly fell asleep, on the nod. He breathed slowly, and appeared relaxed and euphoric. He slowly rubbed and itched his face, slowly and deliberately. His mouth and lips appeared dry. His eyelids were extremely droopy. His face was also droopy. He had great difficulty keeping his eyes open. He spoke with low, raspy voice at times. He moved his hands and arms slowly at times and his hand hung out in front of him, slowly dropping to his lap.   I spoke with Stoltzmann and explained the Drug Influence Evaluation to him. I asked him if he was willing to submit to the evaluation. Stoltzmann stated that he wanted some time to think about it as he looked over the DR-15, Advice of Rights, which he held in his right hand. As he was looking over the form, Stoltzmann was heavily on the nod, and fell asleep with the form in his hand. After several minutes went by, I spoke to him, which woke him up, and asked him if he had made a decision about the evaluation. Stoltzmann did not answer immediately and was on the nod numerous times. He ultimately refused to submit to the Drug Influence Evaluation, at approximately 1708 hours.

My opinion that Stoltzmann was under the influence of a Narcotic Analgesic is supported by the following noticeable indicators:    *OLS Test: 2/4 validated clues  *MRB Test: Slowed internal clock; swaying, leg tremors  *Abnormally constricted pupils  *Depressed Reflexes  *Difficulty concentrating    *Droopy eyelids    *Drowsiness  *Dry mouth  *Euphoria    *Itching    *On the nod    *Slow, mumbled raspy speech    *Slow breathing    *Slow deliberate movements    *Suspected CDS capsule containing white powder scramble recovered from the vehicle and from Stoltzmann at the jail  *Admission to taking Methadone (Narcotic Analgesic)  *Admission to using Kratom (Mitragynine; CNS Stimulant or Narcotic Analgesic properties depending on dosage)      Toxicological Examination:  I had reasonable grounds to request Stoltzmann submit to a blood test for drugs and/or controlled dangerous substances. I reviewed the DR-15, Advice of Rights with Stoltzmann, and requested that he submit to a blood test. Stoltzmann again wanted time to think about submitting to a blood test. He stated he understood the DR-15. Stoltzmann continued to be heavily on the nod, falling asleep with the DR-15 on his lap, slowly slumping forward, and breathing slowly. Stoltzmann agreed to submit to the blood test for drugs and/or controlled dangerous substances, at approximately 1717 hours. I checked the box on the DR-15 form and had him sign below it.       I obtained Blood Kit #J-83 for the blood draw. Stoltzmann signed the Consent card provided in the blood kit at 1720 hours. As I was completing the paperwork for the blood kit, I observed Stoltzmann continued to be heavily on the nod, breathing slowly, relaxed and euphoric, and drowsy.      I also asked Stoltzmann if he had any contraband or drugs/CDS hidden in his pants. I advised him that he would be charged with additional criminal charges if he took contraband or drugs/CDS into the detention center. Stoltzmann stated he did not have any contraband or drugs/CDS hidden on his person (Timestamp 39:49 AXON 5973).      TFC Lowe transported Stoltzmann to the Anne Arundel Medical Center, at 2001 Medical Parkway, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, for the blood draw. TFC Lowe and I witnessed the blood draw. Nurse Emily Bonner administered the blood draw, and obtained two samples of blood. She gave the samples to me and I took custody of the blood kit. Nurse Bonner and TFC Lowe signed the paperwork provided in the blood kit. I responded to the Annapolis Barrack and processed it according to MSP policy and procedures. I mailed the blood kit to MSP, Chemical Test For Alcohol Unit for Toxicology.      TFC Lowe transported Stoltzmann to the Jennifer Road Detention Center for booking.     Miscellaneous: None.   This concluded my portion of the investigation.    The DRE Report and Blood Kit paperwork are attached to this report.   All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>This incident was recorded on MVR and BWC.  On May 13, 2023, at approximately 1531 hours, I was on routine patrol, in uniform of the day and operating marked MSP patrol vehicle J-28. At that time, Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack dispatched TFC Lowe and I for a report of a blue passenger vehicle stopped in the travel portion of the roadway and the driver asleep behind the wheel in the area of E/B Rt 50 and White Hall Rd. Due to heavy traffic, I had to travel down the shoulder portion of the roadway with my lights and sirens activated. I stopped next to a blue passenger vehicle that was stopped in lane 3. As I exited my patrol vehicle, I observed the driver to be asleep, and the vehicle was in drive. I knocked on the window for approximately 10 seconds before the driver woke up. I identified myself and asked the driver if he was OK, and he stated he was tired. I asked the driver to pull his vehicle over to the right shoulder. Once the vehicle was onto the shoulder, I asked the driver where he was coming from and going to, and he stated he was coming from Baltimore, and he was going home to Federalsburg, MD. I asked the driver what time he left Baltimore, and he stated 1:30/2:00 pm. I asked the driver what time he went to bed and what time he woke up, and he stated he went to bed at 3am and woke up at 10am.  TFC Lowe took over as the primary investigating trooper.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 09/30/2023, at 1548 hours, I, TFC. Lowe #6739, responded to Stoltzmanns residence to attempt to serve the blood kit results. There was initially no answer at the door, but Stoltzmanns father arrived home. His father advised he should be in the house. Eventually Stoltzmann came out of the house. I was able to serve Stoltzmann with his blood results, he signed each copy, and was issued appropriate citations. I attached the signed blood results and citations.  I request this case to be closed. </NarrativeText>
