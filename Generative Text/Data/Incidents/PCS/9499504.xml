         <NarrativeText>Traffic stop. In-Car Camera Operational, H-26. This incident was recorded on TFC Thomas Body-Worn Camera.  Driver:  Latisha Mechelle Courtney, AA/F, DOB: 04/15/1981  Maryland SDX:  C-635-488-599-293   Address:  11882 Homestead Place, Waldorf, MD 20601  Vehicle: MD 7FG4556 - 2019 Chrysler 300  Location: N/B Route 301 S/O Route 5  Training and Certificates:   Trained and certified in administering the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Safety Administration.   Completed LIDAR and RADAR training through the Maryland State Police.  Completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E) training in June 2019.   Completed Crisis Intervention Training in September 2020.  Distinguished Graduate of the Maryland Highway Safety Office and University of Maryland DUI Institute in July 2022.  Recipient of the Maryland Highway Safety Office DUI Award for Consecutive Years (2020 and 2021).   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Completed Cannabis Impairment Detection Course in May 2023  Scene Processing:During a Probable Cause Search, I recovered Two (2) clear bags containing suspected Cannabis. I took possession of the CDS for processing and placed it in my vehicle for safekeeping. At the Maryland State Police La Plata H Barrack, the CDS was placed on Property Record P-343737 and was processed according to Maryland State Police policy.  Physical Evidence:The following items were captured on Property Record P-343737.  Item #A: Two (2) clear bags containing suspected Cannabis. Weight: 15.7 grams  The above CDS was stored in the Barrack H CDS Property Room.  NARRATIVE:  PHASE 1  VEHICLE IN MOTION   On 05/20/2023, at approximately 0034 hours, I, TFC Thomas #7065 of the Maryland State Police was on routine patrol in the area of northbound Route 301, south of Route 5 in Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland. At that time, I observed a gray Chrysler 300 bearing Maryland Registration 7FG4556 traveling in lane #1 and travel past my vehicle in lane #2 at a speed above the posted speed limit of 45 MPH. I paced the Chrysler for three-tenths of a mile and obtained a continuous speed of 68 MPH in a 45 MPH speed zone. I positioned my vehicle behind the Chrysler, activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop.  PHASE 2  PERSONAL CONTACT  As the driver rolled her window down, I observed a large puff of Cannabis smoke billowing out of the vehicle. I made contact with the driver and asked her for her license and registration. I immediately observed her pupils were glassy and bloodshot and detected the odor of Cannabis emitting from the vehicle. The driver appeared disoriented. I advised the driver that she could not consume Cannabis while operating a motor vehicle. I further asked the driver if she consumed any alcoholic beverages that night and the driver responded by saying, Yes, I was drinking out in Nanjemoy. The driver had slurred and slow speech and I observed a half-smoked cigarette containing suspected Cannabis extinguished in an ash trash under the car stereo. The driver was identified through her Maryland Drivers License as Latisha Mechelle Courtney (AA/F, DOB: 04/15/1981). The driver continued to show signs of disorientation and lethargy due to her intoxication and I noticed her being extremely talkative. While talking to Courtney, I further detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath.  PHASE 3  PRE-ARREST SCREENING  I asked Courtney if she would conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and she responded by saying, Yes. I asked Courtney if she suffered from High Blood Pressure and she responded by saying, No. I further asked Courtney if she ever had any head trauma, brain tumors or concussions and she responded by saying, No. I asked Courtney, besides the Cannabis, if she took any other intoxicating substances or medications for any injuries and she responded by saying, No. I asked Courtney if she suffered from any medical issues that would prevent her from completing the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and she responded by saying, Im on Social Security but it should not prevent me from conducting the tests.   The three tests attempted were the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus, Walk and Turn and the One-Leg Stand tests. Courtney advised she could not conduct the One Leg Stand. Courtney conducted the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus and Walk and Turn in her bare feet. All tests were performed on a level surface, free of debris and in a well-lit area.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS(6/6 clues observed)   The first test conducted was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held 12-15 inches fromCourtneys eyes. Courtney was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping herhead still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with hereyes until told to stop. Courtneys pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.Courtney advised she understood the instructions. On several occasions, I observed Courtney moving her head from side to side and I had to repeat the instructions for her to watch the pen with her eyes only.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in Both Eyes.  2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in Both Eyes.  3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in Both Eyes.  Vertical Nystagmus  Not Present.  WALK AND TURN(7/8 clues observed)   Prior to Courtney performing the test, Iproperly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Courtney was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel-to-toe. Courtney was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in that position until told to begin. Courtney was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching heel-to-toe on every step. Courtney was instructed to keep her hands flat at her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, it was explained and demonstrated to Courtney to keep her left foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps with her right foot to turn completely around. Again, it was explained and demonstrated to Courtney during the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Courtney was instructed that once she began the test, she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her side, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. Courtney advised she understood the instructions.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Could Not Maintain her Balance.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel-to-toe on steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. 2.) Raised arms more than 6 inches from her side to maintain balance. 3.) Stepped-off line between steps 7 and 8. 4.) Stopped walking during the test.  4.) Incorrect number of steps. Courtney took 10 steps.  Improper turn:Courtney did not complete a series of small steps as directed per the instructions.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Missed heel-to-toe on steps 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9. 2.) Raised arms more than 6 inches from her side to maintain balance. 3.) Stepped-off line between steps 6 and 7.  ONE LEG STAND (Refused to Conduct Test)  I offered Courtney a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT), to which she agreed with a .099 BrAC. Based on my training, knowledge and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and in making DUI and DWI arrests, her glassy and bloodshot eyes, consuming Cannabis while operating a motor vehicle with the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Courtneys breath and her disoriented and lethargic demeanor, I believed Courtney was too impaired to operate a motor vehicle. I placed Courtney under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at 0059 hours.   A Probable Cause Search was conducted on the Chrysler, with two (2) clear bags containing suspected Cannabis being recovered in the center console between the driver and passenger seats.   I recognized the above listed CDS, as Cannabis, a Schedule I Controlled Dangerous Substance, fromtraining, knowledge and experience received while at the Maryland State Police Academy and from previous drug arrests and CDS investigations.   Courtney was transported to the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack for processing.   While in the Barrack, Courtney was advised of her DR-15, Advice of Rights on 05/20/2023 at 0125 hours. Courtney was explained the form, and asked if she had any questions. Courtney responded by saying, No. At 0131 hours, Courtney signed the DR-15, Advise of Rights Form and agreed to submit to an Intoximeter test with a result of .10 BrAC. The Intoximeter operator was Cpl. Burroughs #5968 of the Maryland State Police.   Courtney was processed for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Per Se, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, Driving While Impaired by Alcohol and Driving While Impaired By Drugs and or Alcohol. Courtney was also issued Civil Citation #6Z46643519, for the suspected Cannabis Less Than 1.5 ounces (Personal Use Amount). Courtney was released to a sober driver at the Barrack.  Charges:    TA 21-902(a1ii)  Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Per Se  TA 21-902(a1i)  Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol  TA 21-902(b1i)  Driving While Impaired by Alcohol  TA 21-902(c1i)  Driving While So Far Impaired by Drugs and Alcohol  TA 21-901.1(b)  Negligent Driving  TA 21-901.1(a)  Reckless Driving  TA 21-801.1  Exceeding Posted Speed Limit   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;TA 16-113(h)  Violating License Restriction  All events occurred in Charles County, MD.
