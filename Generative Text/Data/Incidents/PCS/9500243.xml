         <NarrativeText>MSP Un-marked vehicle R39, In-Car Camera Operational. MSP Issued Body Worn Camera Operational All video requests can be emailed to Sgt. Twardowski atjoseph.twardowski@maryland.gov.   EVIDENCE  The Psilocybin Mushroom was recovered from the suspects front left pants pocket. The total weight of 16.5 grams was verified by Sgt. Iman #5709. I recognized the dried Psilocybin Mushroom as a schedule I controlled dangerous substance by my training and knowledge as a Maryland State Trooper. The Psilocybin mushroom was seized and stored according to MSP policy and regulations. Also listed on the MSP Form 67 chain of custody under the Property Held P-339410.   VEHICLE IN MOTION - PHASE 1    On Saturday, August 5th, 2023, at approximately 0055 hours, I (TFC. Lora #7207) was dispatched to the area of I695S, I70, Baltimore County, Maryland in reference to a vehicle in the roadway. I arrived on the scene of what appeared to be a vehicle crash at approximately 0105 hours. I contacted Baltimore County Officer Creter #3974. Ofc. Creter informed me that the vehicle that was disabled in lane one had damage that was sustained from a secondary collision and that the driver claimed of being struck by another vehicle. As I approached the scene, I observed an orange Suzuki SX4 bearing a Maryland registration5ER7413. I observed its steering airbag deployed and its front end to be damaged. I intentionally observed the damage on the front of the vehicle and noticed fresh white paint transfer and what appeared to be black rubber and tire shine markings consistent with the damage that wouldve been sustained from contact with another vehicle. I also observed obvious damage that was consistent with the concrete traffic barrier that was adjacent to the left of the Suzuki at that time.   PERSONAL CONTACT - PHASE 2    I contacted the driver who I identified by his Maryland drivers license card on the scene as Stephen Robert Shaffer, a black male born on June 9th, 1968. I met Shaffer outside his vehicle and inquired about any potential injury to his person at the time to which Shaffer informed me he was fine, but someone hit him. As Shaffer spoke, I noticed his body swaying forward and back. I asked where was he driving from and Shaffer informed me that he was driving from Hightopps (Towson, MD). As Shaffer continued to speak, I noticed his speech was slurred and his eyes were bloodshot, glassy, and his eyelids were lethargic when blinking. I asked about where he was headed to and Shaffer informed me he was headed home. I asked about what was going on at Hightopps and Shaffer informed me that he met with some friends. I followed up by asking about how many alcoholic beverages did he consume and Shaffer replied, Two (2) beers and a shot.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING - PHASE 3  Based on my observations of Shaffer, I offered Standardized Field Sobriety Testing to Shaffer and Shaffer refused.   ARREST  At approximately 0140 hours, I arrested Shaffer for driving under the influence and informed him that if he changed his mind about SFSTs to let me know. At approximately 0215 hours, Shaffer and I arrived at the Golden Ring Barrack located at 8908 Kelso Dr, Essex, MD. Once at the Golden Ring Barrack, a secondary search of Shaffers person revealed a plastic baggie containing a dried plant-like substance. The plant-like substancehad long, slender stems topped by caps with dark gills on the underside andrusty brown with isolated areas of off-white color. Based on my training and knowledge as a Maryland State Trooper, I recognized the plank-like substance to be Psilocybin Mushroom. Psilocybin Mushroom is a Scheduled 1, controlled dangerous substance that is usually ingested orally. However, they may also be brewed as tea or added to food to mask their bitter flavor.Psilocybin Mushrooms effects are similar to other hallucinogens.    At approximately 0229 hours, I played the English audio of the DR15 form in its entirety. The audio can be located via the MVA website (https://mva.maryland.gov/Documents/DR-15-Advice-of-Rights-Audio-English-2.mp4). Shaffer refused to submit to an intoximeter test and signed indicating the same. I informed Shaffer if he changed his mind, just let me know.   Based on the facts I gathered on the scene of the crash, I concluded that the orange Suzuki SX4 bearing a Maryland registration of 5ER7413 was being driven by Shaffer and the other vehicle involved a white Toyota 4runner bearing a Maryland registration of 7ED8995 being driven by Michael Scott Savage, a white male born on May 26th, 1973, was traveling southbound on I695, in the area north of Security Blvd. At that time, Shaffer was traveling in lane two of a four-lane stretch. Shaffer veered right subsequently entering lane three and striking Savages vehicle on its rear right area. Savage was traveling in lane three at the time. Shaffer over-corrected subsequently veering across lane one, subsequently sideswiping the concrete traffic barrier to its left.   20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD  I conducted the observation period on Shaffer in its entirety starting at 0230 hours and no foreign objects or piercings were observed. I escorted Shaffer into the arrest processing room and maintained his custody for the entire time.   INTOXIMETER RESULT  Nothing to report.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland  I request this case be closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
