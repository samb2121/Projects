         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On January 26, 2022, at approximately 1355 hours, I, S/Tpr Whorton assigned to Strategic Operations Group was operating my unmarked MSP vehicle CE-144 and Sgt Hartsock was riding in my front passenger seat. During this time, I observed a red 2006 Ford Ranger bearing MD registration (4FB9349) with heavy window tinting material on the side windows, obstructing my view of the driver and/or passengers as it was traveling South Bound on Industrial Blvd in lane #1 prior to Grand Ave, Cumberland, Allegany County, MD. As I began to pursue the Ford, I was directly behind the Ford approximately 6-7 vehicle lengths behind as I observed a paced speed of 42MPH in a posted 30MPH zone located between Grand Ave and Pennsylvania Ave. The speed limit sign was posted on the right shoulder clear of obstructions.  As I obtained a speed on the Ford, I activated my emergency equipment and the driver continued to travel South Bound while failing to immediately stop. It should be noted, the right shoulder was wide enough for a vehicle and clear of any debris and/or snow. Additionally, lane #2 was also clear from other vehicles traveling or preventing the Ford from changing lanes and stopping on the right shoulder. As the Ford failed to immediately stop, it continued and made a left-hand turn where traveled into the Planet Fitness parking lot, located at 1050 W. Industrial Blvd, Cumberland, MD. As the Ford stopped in a parking spot, the front passenger immediately placed his window down and placed his hands on the window sill of the door and began looking back through the side-view mirror. I then began to approach the drivers side as Sgt Hartsock approached the passenger side. It should be noted, K-9 Handler, S/Tpr Deaner and Sgt Smith arrived at the stop as myself and Sgt Hartsock were exiting my vehicle and approaching the Ford.  I made contact with the driver, who was identified as David Allen Painter (06/02/1975) and advised him the reason for the stop. Painter immediately began to state that he was not speeding and attempted to argue as I deescalated the situation. The front passenger was identified as Robert Allen Miller. While speaking with Painter, I asked him to exit the Ford, and we spoke near the front of my MSP vehicle. As I spoke with Painter and confirmed his address, he stated he was traveling from the South End of Cumberland from the area of Virginia Ave near River Avenue.  While speaking with Painter, S/Tpr Deaner conducted a free air K-9 scan of the Ford while utilizing his K9 partner Captain, which yielded a positive alert for the presence of narcotics. A probable cause search of the Ford was conducted, however was negative for narcotics. While searching the Ford, Sgt Smith spoke with ACNTF investigators in-reference to Miller and was advised that Miller had felony charges through their office. MIller was then placed under arrest for a previous Distribution of Narcotics case and searched incident to arrest.  During the search of Miller, the following CDS and CDS paraphernalia was located on his person: Total weight of suspected fentanyl (13.3 grams) 1-One burnt glass smoking device with trace amounts of suspected crack cocaine (locate by S/Tpr Whorton attached to Millers neck lanyard) 2-One vial with a green lid containing suspected fentanyl (Locate by Sgt Smith inside Millers right jacket pocket) 3-One knotted plastic bag containing six (6) clear capsules of suspected fentanyl (located by Sgt Smith in Millers groin area) 4-Five loose vials with green lids containing suspected fentanyl (located by Sgt Smith in Millers groin area)  After searching Miller, he advised that he had drug and firearm information on subjects in the Allegany County, MD area and requested to speak with ACNTF investigators. Based on the information that Miller was willing to provide, he was released to ACNTF investigators for debriefing purposes.  The CDS and CDS paraphernalia was seized and processed into evidence at the ACNTF Office, which was documented on MSP Form 67 (Chain of Custody) and Property Record (P-342942). The evidence was transported the MSP Cumberland Barracks where it was placed into evidence.  Case open, charges pending cooperation with ACNTF investigators.  All the above events occurred in Allegany County, MD.</NarrativeText>
