         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack J-19 In-Car and Body Camera Operational Maryland State Police DUI J-23-161 LICENSE INFO: MD J-525-782-012-924 Sylvester Johnson B/M DOB: 12/04/1957, 1131 Cavendish Drive, Silver Spring Montgomery County, Maryland 20905. PASSENGER INFO: MD H-200-744-734-640 Rose Rebecca Howes W/F DOB: 08/16/1989 8106 Georgia Ave, Silver Spring Montgomery County, Maryland 20910 TRAINING / CERTIFICATES   Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Administration. (June 2020)  Certified RADAR / LIDAR Operator.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Administration. (July 2023)  VEHICLE IN MOTION:  On Thursday, August 31, 2023, at approximately 1402 hours, I, TFC Yu #7292 was dispatched to a single-vehicle motor vehicle accident eastbound US Route 50 at MD-424, Davidsonville. I arrived at scene and observed a gray Jeep Renegade bearing Virginia Registration TXG1693 on the right shoulder with heavy front end damage. (Refer to ACRS 23-MSP-030672) PERSONAL CONTACT:  Cpl. Anderson #4822 and TFC Baldi #6907 was on scene and advised the driver of the Jeep who was identified through his Maryland Drivers License as Sylvester Johnson B/M DOB: 12/04/1957 was transported to Baltimore Shock Trauma for possibly life-threatening injuries. The passenger identified as Rosa Rebecca Howes W/F DOB: 08/16/1989 through her name and date of birth. A check through NCIC/METERS revealed Howes had a Maryland Identification Card only. Howes was transported to Prince Georges County Shock Trauma for non-life-threatening injuries. Cpl. Anderson also advised that there would be CDS Paraphernalia located in the center console of the Jeep in plain view. The Jeep would be towed back to the Annapolis Barrack for vehicle storage pending investigation.  TFC Baldi #6907 advised that two witnesses advised that the Jeep was traveling in lane 2 eastbound US Route 50 west of MD-424, Davidsonville, and without notice, the Jeep took a right turn directly into the concrete barrier. The witnesses were identified through their Maryland Drivers Licenses as Saleh Jamar Pointer B/M DOB: 10/06/1993 and Robert Allen Siegel W/M DOB: 07/08/1970. TFC Baldi advised that Howes stated they had taken Cocaine prior to driving. TFC Baldi remained on the scene to investigate the motor vehicle crash reconstruction. JP Towing arrived at the scene and loaded the vehicle onto their tow bed. I escorted the Jeep to the Annapolis Barrack for storage. Upon arriving at the Annapolis Barrack, a Probable Cause search was conducted on the Jeep, CDS Paraphernalia was recovered. The recovered items were one plastic straw and one red plastic container with suspected Crack Cocaine residue located in the center console. PRE-ARREST SCREENING  I retrieved an Annapolis Blood Kit J-89 and responded to R. Adam Cowley Shock Trauma in Baltimore. Due to the nature of Johnsons medical condition, a blood sample was retrieved through implied consent. Johnson was then rushed to the Operating Room for further medical treatment. ARREST:  A Blood Sample was performed by RN Michele Duvall at approximately 1642 hours prior to his operation. PROCESSING:  The Blood Kit J-89 Sample was sent to CTAU for further lab analysis. The recovered suspected CDS Paraphernalia was packaged on Property Record Forms 334068 and 334069 in accordance with MSP Policy and sent to the MSP Crime Lab for Processing. The above-stated CDS was identified through my training, knowledge, and experience obtained through multiple hours of drug enforcement training at the Maryland State Police Academy. I request this case remain open pending Blood Kit and CDS Results.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Supplement      Section I. - Narrative On August 31st, 2023, at approximately 1402 hours, the Anne Arundel County Emergency Operations Center received a 911 call in reference to a single-vehicle collision in the area of eastbound US-50 at MD-424 in Davidsonville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. I, Trooper First Class A. J. Baldi #6907, was assigned to manpower in the Annapolis area. I was dispatched and shortly after, an update was received that a male occupant was lying on the shoulder next to the vehicle. I arrived on-scene and contacted members of the Anne Arundel County Fire Department. They advised there were 2 occupants that were traveling inside the vehicle.  The driver, identified by his Maryland drivers license as Sylvester Johnson (B/M DOB: 12/04/1989) was lying on his back next to a Jeep Renegade bearing VA registration TXG1693. The vehicle was positioned perpendicular to eastbound US-50 nosed into a concrete barrier. The Jeep had sustained heavy front-end damage with both front, and side airbag deployment. The passenger identified as Rose Rebecca Howes (W/F DOB: 08/16/1989) through METERS/NCIC appeared to have sustained minor injuries. I overheard Howes state to paramedics that the driver had taken cocaine prior to driving. Johnson, who had sustained life-threatening injuries, was transported from the scene to the R Adams Crowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore City, Maryland for treatment. Howes was transported to the Capital Regional Trauma Center in Largo, Prince Georges County, Maryland. Due to the nature of the collision and the injuries sustained,   I began to mark and photograph scene evidence. A short time later Trooper First Class S. Yu #7292 arrived on-scene and assumed the role as the barrack-level investigator. Upon re-opening the roadway and clearing the scene, the vehicle was towed from the scene to the Annapolis barrack. Once at the barrack, TFC Yu conducted an inventory and recovered a glass stem and a plastic container. The container had the residue of suspected crack cocaine inside it. The recovered contraband was stored in accordance with MSP policy and procedures. The evidence was stored at the Annapolis Barrack property room.  On September 12th, 2023, Johnson was listed in stable condition and previously released from treatment.    Section II. - Attachments that were included in for this report:  The following items were attached to this report:  -Acrs report Authored by Tfc Yu. -26 digital photographs were uploaded to the VeriPic Digital Evidence System.   Conclusion: The following conclusions are based upon the totality of the investigation, including the statements of persons involved, and the physical evidence accumulated. My rendering of these conclusions is based on my training in the field of advanced collision investigation. On August 31st, 2023, aJeep Renegade was traveling eastbound on US-50 west of MD-424 in an unknown lane. The driver subsequently lost control and traveled off-road onto the right shoulder striking the guardrail. The Jeep then re-entered the roadway crossing all lanes into lane 1 nearly striking another vehicle. The Jeep then traveled off-road again onto the right shoulder and struck a concrete barrier where the vehicle came to an uncontrolled final rest. These collision events have been determined to have been caused by Johnsons failure to maintain designated lane directions and losing control of the vehicle he was operating, also pending laboratory results for potential substances in his system that may have impaired his ability to drive a motor vehicle safely.  This case is still active pending further investigation by Tfc Yu.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.    Trooper First Class A. J.

         <NarrativeText>SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE: DRE REQUEST FOR BLOOD SAMPLES TO BE TESTED FOR DRUGS AND/OR CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES   On 12/27/2023, at approximately 1020 hours, I reviewed the facts of this case with TFC S. Yu #7292 and read TFC A. Baldis #6907 supplemental report. Based on the observations and the facts of this investigation, I, a trained and certified Drug Recognition Expert #30407, determined that there was reasonable grounds to request Sylvester Johnsons blood samples be tested for drugs and/or controlled dangerous substances.  My reasonable grounds were as follows:   Driver, Sylvester Johnson B/M, DOB: 12/04/1957, was driving his gray Jeep Renegade, bearing Virginia registration, TXG1693 in the area of eastbound U.S. Route 50 at Maryland Route 424, Davidsonville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland and was involved in a single vehicle life-threatening injury crash on 08/31/2023, at approximately 1401 hours.  Witnesses advised Troopers at the scene that the Jeep abruptly veered right, off the right side of the roadway and struck a concrete traffic barrier.  The passenger in the Jeep, identified as Rose Rebecca Howes, B/F, DOB: 08/16/1985, advised TFC A. Baldi passenger that the driver had used Cocaine, a CNS Stimulantand a controlled dangerous substance, prior to driving his Jeep.  TFC Yu conducted a vehicle search and recovered CDS Paraphernalia containing suspected Cocaine and Crack Cocaine residue.   Johnsons Alcohol Blood Test Result was 0.00 BAC.  I emailed F/SGT W. Koch and F/SGT J. Choma, of the Maryland State Police, Chemical Test For Alcohol Unit, and requested the Johnsons blood samples, containing in Maryland State Police, Annapolis Barrack Blood Kit #J-89, be tested for drugs and/or controlled dangerous substances, at approximately 1032 hours.    This concluded my portion of the investigation.    All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
