         <NarrativeText>The following incident was partially recorded via my MSP issued Body Worn Axon Camera, as well as MSP Marked Vehicle G-9s front mounted Axon recording device.  Incident: Bomb Threat  Location: Hampstead Walmart Supercenter 2320 Hanover Pike Hampstead, Carroll County, Maryland 21074  Date/Time Reported: February 13th, 2023 at approximately 1242 hours  Attachments: -MSP Form 67 Chain of Custody Video Footage of Suspect Conversation -Report Completed by Haines for Walmart Corporation -Printout of Haines -Printout of Grayson -Printout of Ahiakwo  Victim: Walmart Corporation (Hampstead, MD Location) 2320 Hanover Pike Hampstead, MD 21074  Narrative:   On February 13th, 2023 at approximately 1242 hours, I, TFC Hollinger #6938 of the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack, responded to the Hampstead Walmart located at 2320 Hanover Pike in Hampstead, Carroll County, Maryland, for a reported bomb threat via the stores telephone.  I arrived on-scene and made contact with Corporal Rohrback #637 of the Manchester Police Department, Deputy Sitarek #0590 of the Carroll County Sheriffs Office, and Officer Baughman #H0036 of the Hampstead Police Department, who were already on scene. As I arrived, the store was being evacuated with the assistance of the Walmart staff members. The store was safely evacuated, and all members of the public and staff were directed to leave the property without incident. As the store was being evacuated, I was advised the suspect was still on the phone and speaking with Asset Protection Coach Cary Haines DOB 12/2/1994. Corporal Rohrback was present and taking notes of the conversation, but did not actively engage with the suspect. Also, present were Associate Lorenzo Grayson DOB 01/13/1988 and the Manager Chibulor Ahiakwo DOB 08/01/1980. As a collective, Haines, Grayson, and Ahiakwo are referred to in this report as the staff. I then spoke with Corporal Rohrback away from the telephone to avoid alerting the suspect to police presence. According to Corporal Rohrback, the suspect went by the names Joey and Joe.    The following information was obtained from Haines who completed a report for Walmart documenting the incident. Haines report is attached to this incident report. At 1225 hours, the suspect called the store from an anonymous phone number. The suspect stated he placed three 14 inch pipe bombs in the store. The suspect also stated to not call law enforcement, or they would activate the bombs. The suspect then stated he wanted $5,000 in whatever manner was easiest for the store to provide to him. The associates speaking to the suspect were able to stall the suspect long enough to dispatch law enforcement. After further stalling the suspect, the suspect stated he now wanted three Apple gift cards, each preloaded with $500. The staff attempted to provide the suspect with an Apple gift card, but one of the characters was incorrect. The suspect apparently discovered the number was incorrect, and they subsequently became irate. The staff then corrected the card number, and provided the suspect with Apple gift card numbered: X2VDKMGDPHJQ9PRT. The suspect then told the staff to text a picture of the card to the number 620-400-4589. The staff then further attempted to stall the suspect by saying they sent the text, but hadnt. After further delay, the suspect became irate again and stated they were watching the store, and they would find out about the bombs if by not doing what he asked. The suspect claimed they had not done this at any other store and would not elaborate on why they selected the Hampstead Walmart for this incident. Lorenzo then used a phone application to generate a phone number for the suspect to text. The suspect then provided a second phone number 301-825-9036 for the card to be sent to. Lorenzo attempted to send an unloaded Apple gift card to that number. Shortly after, the staff stated they heard what sounded like a phone vibrating in the background, followed by the suspect no longer speaking. At approximately 1333 hours, the suspect disconnected.    After speaking to the staff and confirming the situation, I requested additional manpower resources to further assist in securing the perimeter of the store to prevent further traffic into the area. Maryland State Police bomb K-9s and Allied Agency bomb K-9s were coordinated with the Westminster Barrack and a scan of the area was conducted, which did not yield any contraband or explosive devices.    All pertinent information will be forwarded to TFC Barry of the Criminal Enforcement Division. TFC Barry will be handling the complete investigation for this incident. Please refer to TFC Barrys supplemental report for full investigative details.    On February 14th, 2023, I returned to the Walmart to retrieve video footage of the conversation which had occurred between the staff and the suspect. The conversation had been recorded via the staffs personal cell phones, and was transferred to a USB flash drive. I retrieved the flash drive from Haines, who provided a Certification of Custodian of Records form. The flash drive was processed as evidence and documented on an MSP Form 67 Chain of Custody.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS:   Twilio Legal Request   Twilio Response   Google Order / Request   Google Response   Maxmind Return  NARRATIVE:   On February 13, 2023 I was contacted by First Sergeant Menchey who was acting as the Duty Officer for the MSP Westminster Barrack. I was advised that Barrack Troopers were currently on scene at the Hampstead Walmart located at 2320 Hanover Pike, Hampstead, Carroll County, MD for a reported bomb threat. I was requested to assist with the investigation, and notified that First Sergeant Vinson Smith was the on scene point of contact.    I contacted F/Sgt. Smith at approximately 1347 hours and was provided brief details of the information obtained so far. F/Sgt. Smith advised an unknown male contacted the Walmart via an anonymous number and spoke to employees on site. The male was described as having a Jamaican accent. The male demanded serial numbers from three (3) Apple Gift Cards containing $500.00 each be sent to him via text message. If the demands were not met, the suspect stated he would detonate two (2) pipe bombs in the Walmart. The suspect provided two numbers over the phone to receive the information via text. He provided (620)400-4589 and (301)825-9036. Responding Troopers advised an evacuation was in progress, and Explosive Canines would be responding to clear the building.    Due to the exigent nature of the threat and potential harm to human life, I immediately attempted to obtain further information pertaining to the provided contact numbers. Utilizing open source databases, I was first referred to Verizon Wireless as the owner of number (620)400-4589. I contacted Verizon Wireless via phone and was notified that this number had been ported out to Twilio, Inc. with email contact legalrequest@twilio.com.    I located the Twilio, Inc. legal process page and determined that the only method of contact for legal requests could be made via the Law Enforcement Portal. I created an account, and made an exigent request for subscriber information and IP logs for number (620)400-4589. I attached a formal letter for the information to the online submission form.    At approximately 1450 hours, I received a formal subpoena which I requested from the Carroll County States Attorneys Office. This document has also been uploaded to the Twilio, Inc Law Enforcement Portal.    At approximately 1510 hours, I received a phone call from legal counsel for the Twilio Legal Requests Team. He provided preliminary information indicating number (620)400-4589 was currently leased to company: Mavericks Mobile, which is based in Hong Kong China. He further advised a query of the number indicated no outgoing activity in the last 30 days, therefore no IP log information could be obtained. I received a follow-up message via the law enforcement portal with this information and have printed a copy for the case file.     In reference to number (301)825-9036, Corporal Buck initiated efforts to obtain subscriber information and additional leads. Corporal Buck was initially referred to Bandwidth.com, and later determined the number was presently leased to Google LLC. I provided the information to the Carroll States Attorneys Office and received a legal subpoena directed for the target number via Google LLC. I provided the subpoena to Corporal Buck to be uploaded to the Google Law Enforcement Portal.    At approximately 1630 hours, Corporal Buck notified me that he received an initial response from Google LLC in reference to the legal request. The legal request identified the subscriber information as George Anthony with email capt.georgeanthony21@gmail.com. The account was created on 02-06-2021. The IP address logged at the time of email account creation and used for Terms of Service acknowledgement was 105.112.50.183. Utilizing open source IP location services, specifically Maxmind, the logged IP address returns to Abuja, Nigeria. A 2-step verification phone number was included with the results and documented as +2349012715714. The +234 portion of the number is identified as the Nigerian country code, respectively compared to +1 for the United States.    The Google Voice Account for number (301)825-9036 utilizing Google Account capt.georgeanthony21@gmail.com was created on 05-27-2022. The Signup IP is captured as 45.132.227.102. The IP address via Maxmind returns to service provider IPXO, which according to their website is An IP address marketplace that helps lease and monetize unused IP resources. Investigators know through training, knowledge, and experience that suspects will use services such as IPXO to hide their identities while engaging in criminal activity online, and frequently these services will utilizing network services in foreign jurisdictions.    I reviewed the Google Voice Call log and conducted a general search of outgoing calls. I determined many numbers returned to Walmart Supercenters located throughout the United States. I located a number (925)963-6812 which did not return online. I attempted to call the number due to suspecting that the destination may involve an additional victim. When I made the call, I spoke with Lacy Tennison of Walmart Asset Protection, Emergency Management. Tennison advised she is aware of a larger theft scheme involving threats made to Walmart stores across the United States that has been occurring for approximately 2 weeks. Tennison advised she had received another attempt on this number today, which she identified as being her work cell phone. She stated the suspect(s) likely obtained her number when she was directed to make a call back in the previous weeks when investigating a threat made to a store, and they probably tried to call it again due to thinking it was a Walmart store number. Tennison advised she would provide my contact information to their Global Investigations Unit who are handling the investigation of a larger national scheme.    At approximately 1900 hours, I received a phone call from Daniel Wilcox of the Walmart Threat Management Team. He advised he is aware of the ongoing threats made via phone to Walmart Stores across the country and is responsible for coordinating response and investigative efforts for tracking the events as they occur. He advised the phone number used in the Hampstead case (301)825-9036 has been investigated by law enforcement agencies across the country and is currently under investigation by the FBI. He was also aware of the number belonging to Google Voice and the user having multiple IPs and VPNs to protect their identity. He advised the number is currently being recorded across their phone services throughout the country, and he would attempt to obtain a recording of the phone call made to the Hampstead Walmart. He also will reach out to me on his next working day to provide additional information of the larger national investigation by the FBI and provide a point of contact to relay additional information. He provided his work number as (479)305-4581.    It should be noted that when reviewing the call history provided by Google, a call was made to the Hagerstown Walmart located off MD Route 65. I completed an RMS search and did not locate any incidents for that store today. Wilcox advised he believed an incident had occurred at this store, but did not see it on his log. He stated it can be difficult to reach a live person at the busy stores and likely many calls were made to stores that did not yield a response due to the suspect(s) not being able to reach a live person.    I have made handwritten notes on the attached phone logs documenting the business/person I have positively identified the number as belonging to. Due to the large amount of data provided and thousands of known calls as stated by Wilcox, I only identified the first few pages of numbers. I have attached the full document of returned records should additional numbers need to be tracked at a later date.    On February 14, 2023 at approximately 1430 hours, I was contacted by Matt Lotspeich of Walmart Law Enforcement Liason for Global Security and Investigations. He provided information consistent with Wilcox, and advised he would forward me a contact they are currently working with at the FBI. I was provided with contact information for Special Agent Jonathan Willett of the Little Rock Division.    At approximately 1530 hours, I received a phone call from Special Agent Willett. SA Willett advised of the ongoing investigation and stated it likely tracks to a group working in Nigeria. He provided me with contact information for Special Agent Joelh Calixto who works in the Los Angeles area and identified this as the Division primarily following up on this investigation.    At approximately 1800 hours, I spoke with SA Calixto via phone. Based on the information obtained through his investigation, it is believed the suspects in this case are most likely working out of NIgeria. He advised the FBI currently has an active investigation and requested a copy of the case report to include with his investigation. A completed copy of the report will be forwarded to SA Calixto (JRCALIXTO@fbi.gov) upon completion and approval.  CASE CLOSED - FORWARDED TO OTHER AGENCY</NarrativeText>
