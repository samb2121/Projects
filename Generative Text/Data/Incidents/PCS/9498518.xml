On June 23, 2023 at approximately 1508 hrs., I, Tpr. Ryan Stewart #7590, with the Maryland State Police (MSP) currently assigned to the College Park Barrack Q was on patrol operating unmarked patrol vehicle Q-41 on the ramp from W/B John Hanson Hwy (US 50) to the O/L Capital Beltway (I-495). At that time, traffic was congested on O/L I-495 causing a back-up on the ramp from US 50. While beginning to merge into traffic to continue onto the O/L I-495 I observed a silver Hyundai sedan neglect to merge into traffic and utilize the right shoulder of the ramp, passing cars on the right, continuing towards I-495. After observing the violation I activated my emergency equipment, and attempted to catch up to the vehicle. As I was approaching the suspect vehicle I observed it to begin to reenter the travel portion of the roadway when I placed my patrol vehicle directly behind it to conduct a traffic stop. At that time I observed it to be a silver Hyundai Sonata displaying MD: 9FJ5275 occupied by only the operator. The vehicle pulled to the right shoulder remaining close to the white fog line.   After coming to a stop, I exited my vehicle and approached the passengers side door where I made contact with the driver/sole occupant. I notified the driver of the reason for the stop and requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. The driver advised he did not have his drivers license with him but showed me a copy of his drivers license on his phone, at which time he was identified as Hundaol Mulugeta Wela (B/M 1/5/99). Wela advised the vehicle was a rental car and provided me with a rental agreement from NEXTCAR, Annapolis. After obtaining Welas information I returned to my vehicle to begin checks of Welas driving/wanted status, as well as the vehicles registration/wanted status. Upon reviewing the rental agreement through NEXTCAR I observed it to be rented on June 7, 2023 with a listed return date of June 10, 2023. I further observed the vehicle to be rented to Arthur Derrick Lloyd (B/M DOB: 4/14/01) and Wela was not listed as an additional driver. Once observing the rental agreement I contacted NEXTCAR and spoke with a female representative. While speaking with the representative I advised her I was currently out with the vehicle and the information I received from the driver was the rental agreement had expired 13 days earlier. The representative advised as long as Lloyd was not doing anything illegal he was okay to have the vehicle. At that time, I advised the representative Lloyd was not the operator, nor in the vehicle. The representative immediate advised to tow the vehicle.   During the license status/wanted check of Wela it returned with a suspended status through MD. The registration status/wanted check of the vehicle returned valid. After conducting the checks in my vehicle I returned to the passenger door window. Wela continued to explain why he drove the shoulder which didnt make sense, stating he was just following his GPS. I then requested Wela exit the vehicle and meet me at the back of the vehicle. Wela complied and once to the rear of the vehicle he immediately faced the truck and put his hands up, as if he was getting arrested. I told Wela I just wanted to talk to him and ask that he turned around. At that time I began to explain to him that his license status was suspended. Wela began to explain that he didnt think he was suspended because he passed his permit test and was scheduled to do the road test on Monday (in 3 days). I further explained to Wela that due to the weather and car being towed I would conduct an inventory of the vehicle now while we waited on the tow to arrive. Prior to starting the inventory I asked Wela if everything in the vehicle belonged to him and he advised it did. Wela also advised there was nothing in the vehicle that I needed to know about. Upon starting the inventory of the vehicle I immediately observed a clear sip-lock baggie containing a greenish brown vegetable like matter, suspected marijuana, in the pocket of the drivers door. After locating the suspected marijuana in the drivers door I began my probable cause search of the vehicle.  As I continued my probable cause search of the vehicle I located another clear zip-lock baggie containing suspected marijuana in the center console of the vehicle. In the center console I also observed an empty sandwich size zip-lock box. At that time, I secured the suspected marijuana in my patrol vehicle and continued the search. On the drivers side rear seat I located a small bag which contained Welas MD learners permit and a defaced pill bottle containing two different types of pills. After securing the pill bottle in my vehicle I detained Wela while I attempted to identify the pills. I placed Wela in the front seat of my vehicle and utilized drugs.com pill identifier to identify one of the pill types, white round pill stamped with R P 10 as Oxycodone Hydrochloride, a scheduled II controlled dangerous substance (CDS). The second type of pill, green round pill stamped with M 15, is believed to be a counterfeit pressed fentanyl pill through my training, knowledge, and experience (TKE) of current drug trends. At that time, I advised Wela he was now under arrest, and also notified the College Park Barrack of the same.   Trp. McNamee was responding to assist and I awaited his arrival to continue the search of the vehicle. Upon Tpr. McNamees arrival, I conducted a search of Welas person incident to arrest and located a plastic baggie containing an unknown brown leafy substance in the small coin pocket of his pants, as well as a large amount of U.S. Currency in his front left pocket ($1,070.00). Wela was then placed back into the front seat of my patrol vehicle. I then continued the probable cause search of the vehicle. During the search of the trunk I located a removable panel over the rear tires which allowed access to a natural void area of the vehicle. Behind the panel on the drivers side of the trunk I located two (2) bags in the natural void area, one red and one black, both draw string bags tied into a knot. I removed both bags and observed the black bag to contain a black and silver in color Smith and Wesson SD40 VE handgun. I cleared the firearm and observed it to be loaded. I requested a check of the firearm through the College Park Barrack which yielded no results. I next checked the contents of the red bag and observed it to contain three (3) bundles of U.S. Currency, various denominations, banded together by small rubber bands and a tied black plastic bag. I untied the plastic bag and observed it to contain two zip-lock baggies containing large amounts of round blue pills, suspected pressed fentanyl pills a scheduled II CDS. I seized the firearm, suspected CDS and U.S. Currency.   At that time I transported Wela to the College Park Barrack and Tpr. McNamee remained with the vehicle as Past and Present towing transported it to the College Park Barrack to complete the probable cause search of the vehicle in a safer location.   Upon arrival at the College Park Barrack with Wela, I again search his person, with negative results before placing him into holding cell #1. Once the vehicle was brought to the College Park Barrack I continued with the probable cause search of the vehicle. A small plastic baggie containing suspected marijuana, and small black digital scale was recovered from the drivers door. A second defaced pill bottle and Welas cell phone were recovered from the center console/dashboard area, and the black drawstring bag which contained the firearm were all seized from the vehicle.    At the request of Criminal Enforcement Troopers who were notified of the arrest, I advised Wela of his Miranda Rights utilizing the Maryland State Police Advice of Mirada Rights Form (MSP 180) at 1742 hours. After being read and advised of his rights Wela signed indicating he waved his rights and was willing to speak with me and other troopers about the incident. Trp. McNamee was present and signed as the witness on the MSP 180.         Cpl. Warrick of the Criminal Enforcement Division Firearms Unit responded to the College Park Barrack to debrief Wela. I joined Cpl. Warrick during the debrief of Wela in the intoximeter room of the College Park barrack and was captured on my body worn camera. While speaking with Wela he then invoked his rights and stated he wished to speak with his attorney. All questioning was stopped and Wela was placed back into the holding cell.  After advising Wela of his Miranda Rights, I began to process the evidence recovered from Welas person and the vehicle. The U.S. Currency was counted in a double blind manner by myself and confirmed by Sgt. Bishop. The U.S. Currency total was $8,992.00 in the following denominations: 54  $100.00 bills, 32 - $50.00 bills, 40 - $20.00 bills, 81 - $10.00 bills, 72 - $5.00 bills and 22 - $1.00 bills. The Smith  Wesson SD40 VE firearm (S/N: FWH8915) was properly packaged in the appropriate handgun box along with the magazine and 12 rounds of ammunition. I then began to process the suspected CDS. First, I began with the two clear zip-lock baggies containing the large amount of round blue pills. Through the bag I was able to observe the pills to be stamped with M 30, through my TKE of current drug trends the pills are suspected to be pressed fentanyl counterfeit pills. Due to the baggies containing broken pills and some powder in order to avoid potential exposure the baggies containing the pills were weighed instead of obtaining a pill count. The baggies were weight using an agency issued triple beam balance scale. The scale was zeroed prior to weighing the items. The first baggie of M 30 pills was weighed and observed to have a gross weight of approximately 102.5 grams. The second baggie of M 30 pills was weighed and observed to have a gross weight of approximately 112 grams. Next, I was able to count the pills locate in the rear seat. The pill bottle contained 2 white round pills stamped with R P 10, suspected Oxycodone Hydrochloride a scheduled II CDS, and 14 green pills stamped with M 15, suspected fentanyl, a scheduled II CDS. The unknown brown leafy substance (trace amount) was packaged. Lastly I weighed the suspected marijuana utilizing the same means as mentioned previously and observed them to have the following weight: Item #6 - 1.5 grams, Item #7  21 grams and Item #8  51 grams. All weights were verified by Sgt. Bishop. The suspected CDS was packaged and sent to the Maryland State Police Crime Lab for analysis. The seized defaced pill bottles, drawstring bags, small digital scale and Welas blue IPhone smart device (damaged screen and back) were all packaged and held as evidence.   I know through my training, knowledge and experience (TKE) drug traffickers are known to transport their product in numerous ways to include vehicle highway travel. I also know through my TKE large sums of money, in conjunction with large quantity of product to be indicative of the sales and distribution of CDS. I also know through my TKE drug traffickers to commonly possess weapons to protect themselves, product and money. I also know through my TKE drug traffickers to use natural voids, and mechanical traps to conceal contraband in an effort to avoid detection. I also know through my TKE scales and baggies to be commonly used in the sale and distribution of CDS.   I attended Baltimore County 6 month long Police Academy (2015) and Maryland State Police live-in 6 month long police academy (2022), as well as, attended Top Gun an advanced drug training. I have received training in current drugs trends including: packaging, pricing, and transportation of illegal drugs, as well as methods of manufacturing and consumption of illegal drugs. Additionally, I received a course of study entitled Conducting Complete Traffic Stops presented by the Maryland State Police / National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). During this course of study I received training in current methods and trends of transportation, importation, concealment, and sales of illegal drugs, drug related currency, and weapons. I also received training in methods of drug interdiction, hidden compartments in vehicles, identification of deception and criminal indicators, and methods of operation by criminal enterprises. I was employed as a Deputy Sheriff with the Cecil County Sheriff`s Office for 7 years and currently employed with the Maryland State Police for 1 year and have made and assisted with numerous drug arrests. After completing all the necessary paperwork, I issued Wela his traffic citations for the traffic stop and he was transported to the Prince Georges County Department of Corrections by Trp. McNamee for his initial appearance.   I request this case remain open pending results of lab analysis and test fire of firearm.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
