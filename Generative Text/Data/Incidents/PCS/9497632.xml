         <NarrativeNumber>1</NarrativeNumber>
         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> On 2/15/2023 at approximately 2230 hours, M/Tpr. Hood and Sgt. Roberts were patrolling in the area of Johnathan Street and Charles Street, Hagerstown Maryland. At this time, a dark-colored Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration 34313CL was observed turning around on Charles Street while turning its headlights off and parking on the wrong side of the road. The Honda was also not displaying a front license plate as required by Maryland law. Due to M/Tpr. Hoods training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper and frequently working in the Hagerstown City area he knows that his particular street is known for drug trafficking, hand-to-hand drug transactions and violent crime. M/Tpr. Hood parked in a area that the Honda could be surveilled. After watching the parked car for approximately 2 minutes another passenger vehicle with unknown Maryland registration was observed pulling behind the above listed Honda and park. The driver of this vehicle was then observed exiting the vehicle and walk over to the passenger side window of the Honda. The subject was not identified however it was determined that it was a heavy-set white female. The female was observed handing the passenger of the Honda a unknown amount of money via the passenger side window. The unknown female then walked back to her vehicle and left the area. Due to the observations and the traffic violations observed, M/Tpr. Hood conducted a traffic stop on the 2010 Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration 34313CL. Upon making contact with the driver of the vehicle, M/Tpr. Hood was able to identify the driver by his Maryland drivers license as Zyaire Rajaun Smith 1/M DOB 2-26-2002. Sgt. Roberts made contact with the passenger of the vehicle and was able to identify him by his Maryland identification card as Dajor Javon Montery Walden 1/M DOB 8-21-2003. While getting the appropriate information for the business needs of the traffic stop i.e. license and registration, M/Tpr. Hood was able to detect the strong odor of marijuana coming from within the interior of the vehicle. Due to the observations made, Smith and Walden were asked to exit the vehicle. At this time, Walden and Smith advised, they had some weed and provided a clear plastic bag of green vegetable matter to Officer Wheat with the Hagerstown City Police Department. Due to M/Tpr. Hoods training and experience as Maryland State Trooper he was able to identify the substance as marijuana.  Smith and Walden were both advised of their Miranda rights and waived their right to council. Both subjects were advised that a probable cause search of the vehicle was going to be conducted. During the search of the vehicle another plastic K pack was located on the back seat of the Honda. Located inside this K pack was more green vegetable matter. Again M/Tpr. Hood was able to identify the substance as marijuana due to his training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. Located on the front passenger floorboard, a black AWS digital scale was located along with trace amounts of a white powder. Due to M/Tpr. Hoods training and experience he was able to identify the substance as suspected cocaine.  No other items of value were located in the car. While talking with Smith and Walden, M/Tpr. Hood asked Walden did you give the chick that came up to your window some weed? Walden advised, he sold the unknown female a 8th of marijuana for $30.00. Again, due to M/Tpr. Hoods training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper he knows that a 8th means a 8th of one ounce or 3.5 grams. M/Tpr. Hood then conducted searches on both Walden and Smith. Located in the right front pants pocket and left rear pant pocket was a large amount of US currency. The money was separated in denominations from large bills to smaller bills. M/Tpr. Hood knows that drug dealers will often carry large amounts of money due to the sales and distribution of narcotics. No other items of value were located on Smith or Walden. Due to the observations made, M/Tpr. Hood will be completing an application for charges for the possession of CDS marijuana, possession of CDS not marijuana and possession of CDS with intent to distribute. Walden and Smith were released from the scene. All the above property was transported to the Hagerstown State Police Barracks documented on a MSP from 67 and PH # 336762.  All the above events occurred in Washington County Maryland.  CASE STATUS: I request this case remain open pending charges </NarrativeText>
