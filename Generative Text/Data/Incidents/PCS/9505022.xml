         <NarrativeText> Case Synopsis: In June of 2023, Senior Trooper Braxton of the Maryland State Police- Maryland State Apprehension Team/US Marshals Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, was asked to assist in locating and arresting two wanted fugitives. The first fugitive was identified as Damein Kaseem Cheeks, B/M, DOB: 07/14/2005. He was wanted by Baltimore City Police for Firearm Drug Trafficking along with additional charges (case number 0B02475340). He was also wanted by Baltimore County Police for Attempted First Degree Murder for a non-fatal shooting that occurred on June 14, 2023 (case number: D08CR23018509). The second fugitive was identified as Tyler Antoine Hughes, B/M, DOB: 01/05/2005. Fugitive Hughes was also wanted for the same non-fatal shooting that fugitive Cheeks was wanted for. It is alleged that both Cheeks and Hughes were involved in a drug deal gone bad when they attempted to rob the victim during the transaction. The victim began fleeing from the scene, in which time he was fired upon by Cheeks and Hughes, but was not hurt. S/Tpr. Braxton was assigned the fugitive case for both Cheeks and Hughes. A complete workup was done on fugitive Cheeks and Hughes family, friends, social media, and pattern of life. An Instagram account was found for both of them. S/Tpr Braxton authored a court order for a pen register trap  trace over fugitive Cheeks account. Task force members assisted with doing multiple days of surveillance at multiple locations for Cheeks and Hughes. The vehicle used in the shooting was identified as Hughes father vehicle, which was a black 2010 Honda Accord bearing MD registration 2ET6440. On June 21, 2023, task force members located that vehicle parked in front of 4917 Saint Georges Ave, Baltimore, MD 21212. Also during a separate surveillance operation that day, fugitive Cheeks was observed walking into his primary residence of 2710 The Alameda, Baltimore, MD 21218. On June 22, 2023, MSAT Central/ USMS CARFTF task force members began preparing to apprehend fugitive Cheeks and fugitive Hughes at both locations. Intel was then learned that fugitive Cheeks was possibly inside of 2950 Harford Road, Baltimore, MD 21218. Fugitive Hughes vehicle was still parked in front of his parents residence on Saint Georges Ave. USMS task force members responded to both residence simultaneously. Upon arrival at 2950 Harford Road, task force members surrounded the location and began knocking on the front door. The door was opened by a Daquan Addision, who advised his sister Deasia and his friend Dame was inside. Task force members began calling for Dame to come outside. After a few moments, the friend Dame still did not come outside the residence. Task force members received permission from Daquan to enter the residence. Once inside the residence, Dame (fugitive Cheeks), came down the stairs and was taken into custody without incident. During a search incident to arrest, task force members located 2.6 grams of Marijuana in his right pant pocket. That Marijuana was eventually transported to the MSP Golden Ring Barrack where it will be sent off for destruction. Task force members also surrounded 4917 Saint Georges Ave. While preparing to approach that location, fugitive Hughes dad arrived and made contact with task force members. He soon advised that fugitive Hughes was inside the residence and he would have him come outside. Fugitive Hughes eventually came out the residence and was taken into custody without incident. Both houses were held by Baltimore County Police for a search  seizure warrant. Fugitive Cheeks was transported to Baltimore City Central Booking for processing and fugitive Hughes was transported by Baltimore County Police to White Marsh Precinct where he would be interviewed by detectives.</NarrativeText>
