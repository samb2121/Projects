         <NarrativeText>This stop was audibly and visually recorded using the Axon Digital Video Camera System installed in Maryland State Police Unit, U-4, as well as my Axon Body-Worn Camera.  PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: One (1) Maryland State Police Property Record (P-343847) One (1) Maryland State Police Chain of Custody Log One (1) Statement of Charges One (1) Statement of Probable Cause One (1) Burnt glass smoking device containing suspected Cocaine. Weight: Trace (A) Three (3) Orange pills, suspected to beAmphetamine/Dextroamphetamine. (B) Four (4) Green pills, suspected to be Clonazepam. (C)  NARRATIVE:   On January 22, 2023, at approximately 0140 hours, I was on-duty, on patrol, operating marked Maryland State Police patrol vehicle, U-4, in full uniform. I was conducting a patrol check of BP Gas Station, located at 2975 Chesapeake Beach Road, Dunkirk, Calvert County, Maryland. As I was exiting the parking lot, I observed a white 1996 Ford Explorer, bearing Maryland registration 1Z0331, exit the parking lot and begin traveling eastbound on Chesapeake Beach Road. As the vehicle passed directly in front of my patrol vehicle, I observed the female driver on her cellphone. I could see the driver had her cellphone up to her left ear. This was clearly visible by my patrol vehicles headlights, and streetlights.    I began following the vehicle and observed the passenger side tires cross completely over the solid white fog line several times. As we traveled eastbound on Chesapeake Beach Road, I observed the drivers side tires cross completely over the solid double yellow center line. I observed the vehicle was unable to maintain a constant speed. The vehicle sped up and slowed down several times for no apparent reason. I activated my emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle on eastbound Chesapeake Beach Road at Thomas Avenue. The vehicle pulled into the bank parking lot, located at 137 Chesapeake Beach Road, Owings, Calvert County, Maryland.    I made contact with the driver, and sole occupant, Cherry Bien Sy (A/F, 11/15/1983), who was identified by her Maryland drivers license. I advised Sy the reason for the stop and she stated she was looking for her boyfriends residence. Sy acknowledged she was on her cellphone and advised me she was speaking with her boyfriend trying to get directions. While speaking with Sy, I observed her hands and body were visibly shaking. While speaking with Sy, she would not look at me and she kept her body bladed away from me. I observed Sy could not keep her legs still, and it appeared she was frantically looking for something.     Due to the above observations and criminal indicators, I requested the assistance of a CDS detection canine. At this time, there were no CDS canines available to respond to the scene. I conducted a law enforcement query utilizing Linx (Law Enforcement Information Exchange), and observed Sy had previously been involved in burglaries, thefts, and possession of controlled dangerous substances. I completed the business needs of the traffic stop and issued Sy warnings for the violations observed. I explained the warnings to Sy and provided her with her license and registration card. After advising Sy she was free to leave, I asked her about the previously mentioned charges. I asked Sy about the burglaries and thefts. Sy stated those were old charges and occurred when she was with the wrong crowd. I asked Sy about the drug charges, and she stated she used to be hooked on painkillers. I asked Sy if there was anything illegal in the vehicle, at which time she stated, No. I asked Sy if she would give me consent to search her vehicle, at which time Sy verbally gave me consent to search her vehicle.    As Sy was exiting her vehicle, I asked her again if there was anything illegal in her vehicle. Sy advised me that she did not know if there was anything in there because she is not the only one to drive her vehicle.    I began the search of the vehicle in the center console. Inside the center console, I located a burnt glass smoking device with burnt copper fibers containing suspected cocaine residue. At approximately 0200 hours, I detained Sy and read her her Miranda Rights. Sy verbally stated she understood each of her rights and verbally waived her rights, electing to speak with me. I asked Sy about the burnt glass smoking device and she stated, Its not mine. As I continued to search the vehicle, I located three (3) orange pills, suspected to by Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine, and four(4) green pills, suspected to be Clonazepam, located in Sys purse. Sy stated she has a prescription for the above listed CDS, however, she did not have the prescription in her possession. Sy stated she carries the pills loose in a baggie, so they do not get stolen.    I identified the above listed CDS through my training, knowledge, and experience in drug investigations as a Maryland State Trooper.  Cocaine is a Schedule II Controlled Dangerous Substance. Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine is a Schedule II Controlled Dangerous Substance. Clonazepam is a Schedule IV Controlled Dangerous Substance.    At approximately 0218 hours, I advised Sy she was under arrest for Possession of CDS: Not Cannabis.  I transported Sy to the Calvert County Detention Center for further processing.    Sy was issued warnings for the traffic violations.    The above listed CDS was packaged and processed in accordance with Maryland State Police policy and procedures, and verified by Sgt C. Evans #5156, of the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack. The CDS was placed in the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack Property Room on January 22, 2023, at approximately 0530 hours.  All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
