         <NarrativeText> Scene Processing:The traffic stop, field sobriety, and arrest were captured on my Maryland State Police issued Body Camera.  Physical Evidence: A. Etix Citations B. Two color images (suspect and contraband) C. DR-15 D. MSP 33 (Result of test for alcohol concentration) E. MSP 67 Chain of Custody F. MSP Property Held P-340359 G. DC/CR- Statement of Charges  Narrative:   On 1/9/24 at approximately 1500 hours, I, Senior Trooper Oyler #6301, was standing by at 26430 Loveville Road, Mechanicsville, MD 20659 relating to case involving the possible manufacturing the distribution of drugs when several vehicles drove down the driveway within minutes of each other attempting to contact a subject named Mike.   While standing in the yard, a White Ford Escape, Maryland registration 4DZ1788, operated by a driver, later identified as Richard Edward Wood Jr. (DOB 6/12/84) W/M, who was not wearing his seat-belt, drove up the driveway to our location. The driver was still not wearing his seat belt when I approached him. I contacted the driver, introduced myself and asked him what business he had at the location. I observed his speech was deep, slow and thick, and that his eyelids were half open, then would open them wide, only to have them slowly close half way.   I observed Wood staring at the open shed door where several law enforcement officers were securing the area in preparation for a search warrant and had a conversation with Wood about it. Wood said he was going to buy weed from a man named Mike, however later in our interaction recanted this and said he was going to buy crack.  I had the driver exit the vehicle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) and conducted a pat down for weapons due to a large bulge in the right front pocket of Woods pants. As I conducted the pat down, I recognized the object in the front right pocket of Woods pants as a pill bottle. I asked him about the pill bottle and the contents and Wood said he had Xanax and Adderall... I clarified that they were both contained in the same prescription bottle and Wood said they were. Wood removed the bottle from his pocket and handed it to me.I observed three different pill types within one amber pill bottle. The pill bottle was placed onto the roof of the white Ford Escape for a moment, then handed to Cpl. Powis #6750 for safe keeping while I conducted SFSTs.  The weather conditions were raining with an outside temperature of approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Wood said he had a metal rod in his left leg and a metal plate in his right ankle. He denied any recent head trauma and denied having contacts. He stated having anxiety and ADHD.   I had Wood walk to the front of his vehicle and sit on the front bumper due to the height difference between him and I.  HGN: I had Wood sit on the front bumper of his vehicle and explained the instructions for Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. I observed the driver had blue eyes, no resting nystagmus, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees and vertical nystagmus. 6/6 clues.  Walk and Turn: I placed Wood in the starting position for Walk and Turn with his right foot in front of his left and hands at his side briefly before he broke the starting position by taking a step and standing with his feet apart. While explaining and demonstrating the walk and turn Wood complained that the ground was too soft from the rain. I offered to allow him to find a location that was more suitable. We located a spot on the hard driveway of the residence and I removed a few sticks to ensure there was no debris in the way of the test. I began again and placed Wood in the starting position for the test with his right foot in front of his left foot heel-to-toe and hands at his side. During the instructional phase Wood repeated back to me the number of steps he was to take 9. On the first set of 9 steps he took 8 actual steps. He made an improper turn by turning with both feet by turning to the right. On the second set of steps Wood stopped at step three, then stepped off-line with his left foot, missed heel-to-toe by more than 1 inch, and raised his arms by more than six inches off of his body on step 5. 6/8 clues  One leg Stand: I placed Wood in the starting position for the One Leg Stand with his heels together and toes together. During the instructional phase Wood began raising his left foot and I asked him to get back into the starting position. He responded by saying that he wanted to figure out which leg he would do better on. Wood then began the test with his right foot raised. During the test Wood put his foot down on count 5 and did not raise it again until count 12, he then put his foot down again at count 14, he used his arms for balance and swayed during the entire test. 3/4 clues  I declared that the driver was driving under the influence of an intoxicating substance and placed him under arrest at 0941 hours.  The amber color pill bottle located in the front right pocket of Woods pants pocket had a label for Alprazolam C4 2mg prescribed to Wood. The bottle contained 6 white bars with the impression Y 2 1 suspected Alprazolam, and 2 oval, peach-colored pills with the impression e 505 2 0, suspected Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine 20 mg. Additionally, there were two (2) tan pills identified as suspected Gabapentin, a non-scheduled drug. Wood verbally consented to the Gabapentin being destroyed due to the fact that the jail would not accept pills not in a prescription bottle. The two Gabapentin pills were destroyed locally.  The driver was charged with two counts possession CDS not Cannabis for the suspected2 oval, peach-colored pills with the impression e 505 2 0, suspected Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine 20 mg.  The driver was searched, mouth check was completed. The driver was placed in my unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle, T-16.  The driver was transported to the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack and processed for DUI, he was read the DR-15 Advice of Rights while en route and elected to take the test at 1008 hours.  At 1039 hours the driver submitted a Intoximeter test that resulted in sample of .00 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, obtained by Sgt. Gibson # 5411. At 1105 hours the driver refused to submit to the requested DRE exam.  The driver was transported to the St. Marys County Detention Center for the criminal charges of possession CDS not marijuana (two counts) where he was held pending appearance before a District Court Commissioner.  All CDS and related materials were processed and packaged according to MSP policy and procedure. Copies of all forms are attached to this report.  All events occurred in St. Marys County. </NarrativeText>
