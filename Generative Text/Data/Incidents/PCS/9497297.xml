         <NarrativeText>Attachments: None  Complainant: Fussell, David (B/M/06/16/1962) 1234 Washington Road, Room 207, Bed 3 Westminster, MD 21157  Complainant Statement: Fussell is non-communicative  Narrative: On February 8, 2023, I (TFC Eckhardt #6469), was on duty and in uniform when I responded to Westminster Healthcare, located at 1234 Washington Road, in Carroll County, for a check welfare.  The facility contacted the Maryland State Police advising that a patient, David Fussell, complained of foot pain on Monday, February 8th. On February 9th, he received an x-ray that showed a small hairline style fracture in his right foot. Due to there being an injury, the facility had to contact the State Police.  I was advised that Fussell is non-communicative and non-ambulatory. Upon my arrival, I made contact with Fussell, who was laying in his bed. I attempted to speak with him to see what his baseline was. All he would say is, Fish Wife, Fish Wife, Wife Fish. I asked for a pad of paper and a marker for him to write for me. He was unable to write as well. He seemed confused while holding the marker and did not seem to comprehend what I was asking of him.  I observed Fussells bed to be very low to the ground and without sides or handrails. I observed blue gymnastic style mats laying on the floor next to the bed.  I spoke with LPN John Mukuru, who was his caretaker for the evening. I asked about the mats to which he explained that the mats are there because Fussell will at times roll himself out of bed. That is also why his bed stays very low to the ground. The only time his bed is raised is during feeding time. He is unsupervised during feeding time because he is able to feed himself.  According to LPS Mukuru, Fussell had a stroke which is why he is in the facility. For some time now, all Fussell will say is, Fish Wife. He is not sure how Fussells foot became fractured. I briefly looked at his foot and I did not see any obvious signs of trauma.  I did record the majority of my conversation with Fussell and Mukuru on my body camera. I also recorded a second video showing the setup of his room and the mats by the bed.  Due to the uncertain cause for the injury, and to ensure Fussell has all appropriate accommodations, I respectfully request this incident to be forwarded to the Maryland Health Department for review.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
