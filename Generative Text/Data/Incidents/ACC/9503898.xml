         <NarrativeText>This incident was audibly and visually recorded using the Axon Digital Video Camera System in Maryland State Police Unit, U-13, and Body-Worn Camera. Scene Processing:   TFC Engleman was contacted for the Crash Reconstruction  MSP Form 89B was completed per MSP policy and procedure.  Eight (8) digital photographs were taken of the victim and uploaded to VeriPic per MSP Policy and Procedure.   Two (2) Written Statements.   Maryland State Police Form 50 (Storage form) and storage report for the involved vehicle were completed MVI: 23-004.    Narrative:      On January 24, 2023, at approximately 1846 hours, the Calvert Control Center broadcasted a single-vehicle collision into a building at 205 Steeple Chase Drive Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland. I arrived on the scene at approximately 1848 hours.  Upon arrival, I observed a black Ford Explorer bearing Maryland registration, 3Z2436 stationary against the front support column of Dental Care of Prince Frederick. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Larry Hilton Mackall (B/M DOB: 03/31/1960). Mackall was unresponsive in the driver seat of the vehicle with his foot stuck on the accelerator pedal. I attempted to bang on the driver window to get Mackalls attention but was unsuccessful and attempted to open both doors on the drivers side without success. I then utilized my expandable baton and broke out the rear driver-side window to gain access into the vehicle and attempt to get inside the vehicle. Additional units for the Calvert County Sheriffs Office responded to the scene and were able to get in the vehicle on the passenger side. Once Deputy Zinn and Deputy Dawson were able to get access to the passenger side, I then went around the vehicle, got inside, put the vehicle in park, turned the vehicle completely off, and removed the keys.   After getting the vehicle shut off, EMS personnel were able to safely get to Mackall and remove him from the vehicle. After getting Mackall from the vehicle, EMS began attempting life-saving measures. Mackall was transported by Paramedic Ambulance 246 (run #: 23-201) to Calvert Health Medical Center. I remained on scene and began speaking with the witness and caller, Amber Marie Camp (W/F DOB:12/19/1979). Camp advised the black Ford driven by Mackall was seen leaving from the Fox Run Shopping Center passing Cato Fashion when it initially struck the curb to the right. The vehicle had corrected after hitting the curb, then subsequently struck another curb prior to entering the intersection of Armory Road and Steeple Chase Drive. The Ford had corrected again but did not stop at the stop sign, veered to the left, and briefly stopped after hitting the curb on Steeple Chase Drive. After striking the curb and briefly coming to rest, Camp advised the vehicle suddenly accelerated into a wooden support sign and down a grass hill, struck a light pole, and finally came to an uncontrolled rest into the brick and concrete support pillar.   After I spoke with the witness, I contacted the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack to provide Mackalls information and requested an ACI/Reconstructionist. TFC Engleman #7197 responded to the scene for ACI/Reconstruction and Cpl. Oleksak #6300 responded to the scene to assist with processing. I responded to the Calvert Health Medical Center to check the status of Mackall. I made contact with Dr. Chad W. Smith who advised he pronounced Mackall deceased at 1939 hours. Hospital staff advised they had contacted the Forensic Investigator for them to respond for the remains to be sent to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, Maryland. Forensic Investigator, Kristina Dillon responded to the medical center. FI Dillon provided the OCME case number: 23-01123. After I spoke with FI Dillon, I met the son and next of kin of the decedent, Larry Terrell Mackall (B/M DOB: 02/18/1983). Larry Mackall was informed his father passed and was provided the case number for the incident.   I request this case remain open pending autopsy results and the results of the Crash Reconstruction Investigation. All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report (For review by the MSP Crash Team)  In-car camera operational, T-6. BWC utilized.  Section I. - Introduction:    On January 23, 2023, at approximately 1846 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack responded to 205 Steeple Chase Drive Suite 208, Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland 20678 in reference to a serious motor vehicle collision into a building. Deputies from the Calvert County Sheriffs Office, as well as Prince Frederick Fire Department Fire/EMS personnel, also responded to assist. Troopers observed a 2000 Ford Explorer that collided with a commercial building after striking a curb, a wooden sign, and a light pole. The operator and sole occupant of the Ford, Larry Hilton Mackall (B/M DOB: 03/31/1960) was transported by Prince Frederick Volunteer Rescue Squad to Calvert Health Medical Center for treatment with CPR in progress. Mackall later sustained injuries that were not compatible with life and was pronounced deceased at Calvert Health Medical Center at 1939 hours by Dr. Chad Smith.   Due to the seriousness of the collision, a request was made for an Advanced Collision Investigator (ACI) by the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack and I was the regional ACI on duty. I responded to the scene as requested and arrived on scene at 1949 hours. According to the information gathered on scene, Mackall was traveling southbound from the Fox Run Shopping Center approaching Armory Road and Steeple Chase Drive, Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland 20678. At that time, he struck two curbs, failed to stop at a stop sign, struck an additional curb, a wooden sign, and a light pole. The vehicle came to an uncontrolled final rest in the building of Dental Care of Prince Frederick located at the above mentioned address.    Section II. - Scene Description: (The following descriptions are based on the area where the collision occurred.)  Primary Roadway:    The primary collision occurred on the northbound side of the Armory Road and Steeple Chase Drive, Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland intersection. An access roadway leading from the Fox Run Shopping Center was also part of the collision events. Armory Road, Steeple Chase Drive, and the access road from the shopping center were all constructed of asphalt. The access road consisted of an unpainted north and southbound lane, later divided by a positive median barrier at the intersection. Steeple Chase Drive and Armory Road both consisted of one northbound and one southbound lane divided by solid double yellow lane lines. The speed limit on Armory Road in the area of the collision was posted at 30 miles-per-hour. The speed limit for the access road and Steeple Chase Drive in the area of the collision was not posted. In the area of the collision, the access roadway from Fox Run Shopping Center was straight and formed into a small incline as it met with the intersection. The Steeple Chase Drive and Armory Road intersection was straight and essentially level. In the area of the collision were multiple commercial businesses with adequate outdoor lighting and street lights. The roadways were free of any obvious signs of debris and defects.  Environmental Conditions:   The collision occurred during the late evening hours while it was dark. The roadway was dry and appeared to be free of any debris. At the time of the collision, the temperature was approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit with 12 mile-per-hour winds.    Section III. - Scene Evidence:   There was limited roadway evidence as a result of the collision events occurring off road in small landscaping areas and grass. I first located an area of disturbed mulch leading from an S curve on the Fox Run Shopping Center access road just past the Joann Fabrics commercial building. The Ford traveled 15.6 feet through the mulch before re-entering the roadway. The Ford continued southbound on the access roadway another 169.2 feet before driving off the roadway again with its drivers side tires. I located an additional area of disturbed mulch at the positive median barrier on the access roadway. The Ford traveled 7.9 feet through the mulch before re-entering the roadway and approaching the Steeple Chase Drive and Armory Road intersection. After entering the intersection, The Ford accelerated into a slight left turn and traveled 79.5 feet before striking a curb and exiting the roadway down an embankment to the lower commercial parking lot of the Dental Care of Prince Frederick business, identified previously. The Ford traveled 41.1 feet down the landscaped embankment striking a wooden sign and a 15.7 foot light pole knocking it from its standing position. The Ford re-entered the commercial parking lot and traveled an additional 52.5 feet before striking a support pillar to the Dental Care of Prince Frederick building. From the time the Ford began to exit the roadway on the shopping center access road to its position of uncontrolled final rest, it traveled 430 feet through three (3) mulch beds, after striking three (3) curbs, and crossing multiple paved roadways. During the collision events the Ford struck three (3) curbs prior to traveling down an embankment, striking a wooden sign and a light pole, and later striking a building. Small miscellaneous parts and debris from the Ford were located in the parking lot of the building which was struck. I obtained photographs of the vehicle and the roadway at the scene of the collision.    Section IV. - Vehicle(s) Involved:  Vehicle #1: 2000 Ford Explorer (VIN: 1FMZU72X4YUB70389)   The blue Ford Explorer was displaying Maryland registration 3Z2436. The owner/operator was Larry Hilton Mackall (B/M DOB: 03/31/1960) of Prince Frederick, Maryland. Mackall was identified by his MVA photograph.   The Ford was observed in its position of uncontrolled final rest against a building support pillar of Dental Care of Prince Frederick, located at 205 Steeple Chase Drive Suite 208, Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland 20678. There was disabling damage to the front passenger side of the vehicle and the passenger side rear tire was shredded off. The Fords airbags did not deploy during the collision events and Mackall was properly restrained.    Section V. - Person(s) Involved:  Person #1 Larry Hilton Mackall (B/M DOB: 03/31/1960) (Deceased):   Mackall was operator/sole occupant of the Ford Explorer.   Mackall was located in the front drivers seat of the Ford Explorer on scene by Troopers from the Prince Frederick Barrack with his foot still on the vehicles accelerator. Mackall had no visible external injuries to report. The vehicles air bag did not deploy, however, Mackall was wearing his seat belt at the time of the collision. Mackall sustained unknown internal injuries which will be revealed once an autopsy is performed.   Witness #1 Eva Felicia Santina-Aleshire (H/F DOB: 08/29/1975):    Santina - Aleshire was inside the business the vehicle collided into during the collision. Santina - Aleshire was not involved in the collision and remained on scene during the investigation as a witness.    Santina - Aleshire completed a MSP Form 076, Written Statement and a copy has been attached to this report. In Santina - Aleshires written statement she reported, @643pm I heard tires squealing and a loud noise outside. Then I heard a loud bang and the building shook. I saw a truck had hit the building and I called 911. I couldnt tell right away if he was awake/conscious but the tires kept going. I realized he was unconscious but the 911 dispatcher advised me not to approach.  Witness #2 Amber Marie Camp (W/F DOB: 12/19/1979):   Camp was behind Mackalls vehicle prior to the collision. Camp was not involved in the collision and remained on scene during the investigation as a witness.   Camp completed a MSP Form 076, Written Statement and a copy has been attached to this report. In Camps written statement she reported, As I was leaving work I was coming up on a stop sign. The SUV in front of me started goin to the left side of the road. He then drove over the grass and was slowly going over it as if not trying to do any damage to the truck. The truck then floored it and he hit a sign across the street and stopped. He then floored it again and went down the hill and hit the bricks at the dental office. I drove down to call the police and to see if the person was ok. I stayed on the phone till they got here.  Other Involved Person: Eric Andrew Bailey (W/M DOB: 05/03/1982):   Bailey is the building manager for Generation Properties, LLC.

Time Stamp 01/23/2023 18:54:59: Video ends   Date: (01/31/2023):   As of the submission of this DCIR, I have not received the autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) for Mackall. A supplement will be completed once the report has been obtained.  Date: (02/06/2023):    On February 6, 2023, at approximately 0930 hours, I contacted the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) in order to obtain a preliminary cause of death. I was told the case is still pending at this time and a cause of death has not been determined.    Section VII. - Analysis of Electronic Control Modules:   The Electronic Control Module (ECM) was not imaged for this investigation as the airbags did not deploy.    Section VIII. - Speed Analysis:   There was not enough sufficient roadway evidence to conduct a speed analysis of the collision events.    Section IX. - Crash Dynamics:   A blue Ford Explorer was traveling southbound on an access roadway from the Fox Run Shopping Center approaching the intersection of Armory Road and Steeple Chase Drive. At that time, the Ford failed to maintain its lane of travel, stop at a stop sign, and properly negotiate a left turn from the intersection leaving the roadway to the right of Steeple Chase Drive. Tire marks in the mulch and grass indicated the areas where the Ford left the roadway during the collision events. The Ford traveled 41.1 feet down a landscaped embankment before entering a commercial parking lot and striking a building. In the parking lot, scraps and gouging in the roadway were observed from where the Ford dragged the light pole from its standing position breaking it off at the base. The total distance the Ford traveled was 430 feet.    Section X. - Attachments that were included in for this report:  The following items were attached to this report:     One copy of the ACRS report completed by TFC Smith  Two (2) MSP Form 076, Written Statements obtained by TFC Smith  One (1) MSP Form, 89B - Death Investigation Report completed by TFC Smith  One (1) Abandoned/Impounded Vehicle Report completed by TFC Smith  MVA Records  One (1) Autopsy Report Request  One diagram (not to scale) created by TFC Engleman  Scene notes created by TFC Engleman  Supplemental Reports completed by Cpl. Oleksak (reference 23-002873)  Incident Call for Service Records  Five (5) satellite images of the scene obtained by TFC Engleman     Conclusion:   The following conclusions are based upon the totality of the investigation, the physical evidence accumulated, as well as reports submitted by other investigators concerning this incident. My rendering of these conclusions is based upon my training, knowledge, and experience in the field of collision reconstruction and are to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.   On Monday, January 23, 2022, at approximately 1846 hours, a blue Ford Explorer operated by Larry Hilton Mackal was traveling southbound from a shopping center access roadway approaching the intersection of Armory Road and Steeple Chase Drive, Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland. For unknown reasons, the Ford failed to maintain its lane of travel, stop at a stop sign, and properly negotiate a left turn from the intersection leaving the roadway to the right of Steeple Chase Drive. The Ford continued off road, traveling through a landscaped embankment, and struck a wooden sign, a light pole, and struck a building at its position of uncontrolled final rest. These collision events were determined to be caused by Larry Hilton Mackall who failed to maintain proper road positioning, a turn, and control the vehicles speed. The collision events led to the death of Larry Hilton Mackall.  This case remains open pending autopsy results.
