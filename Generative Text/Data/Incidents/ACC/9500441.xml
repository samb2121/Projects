         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police, Barrack D Unmarked MSP Vehicle D-17. In-Car Camera Operational.  Defendant: Alfonso-Vazquez, Sergio Date of Birth: 05/03/1974 Date of Arrest: 05/13/2023 Time of Arrest: 1740hours DUI #: 23-129(Bel Air) Blood test Result: .22 Br AC  BEHAVIOR/CONDUCT: Alfonso-Vazquez was cooperative and polite  CERTIFICATION  TRAINING NHSTA Trained/certified to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) Preliminary breath test operator certified Certified Radar/Laser Operator  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 05/13/2022at approximately 1652hours, I, Trooper Kumador #7052 of the Maryland State Police, Bel AirBarrack was dispatched to Southbound MD-24 in the area of I-95 in Abingdon, HarfordCounty, Maryland in reference to motor vehicle collision. I arrived on scene and observed a Hispanic male driverseated behind the wheel of a Cream Subaru Outback displaying Maryland registration 50303CL with heavy front-end damage. I also observed a Black Honda Civic with damage to the rear bumper area. Both vehicles pulled on the right shoulder. EMS and Fire board were on scene. Lane 2 was shut down by the Fire board. It was raining.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made a driver side approachof the Subaru and made contact with the male Hispanic driver. I introduced myself and asked him if he was OK to which he stated yes. I asked him if he was the driver, and he said yes. I asked him if he needs medication attention, and he stated No. He appeared drowsy and his eyes appeared bloodshot, which is indicative of someone being under the influence. I asked him to exit his vehicle to speak with me outside. He exited the vehicle holding the door for support. I asked him what happened, and he stated he does not know. I asked him if he had taken any medication and he stated no.  I detected the odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath as he spoke with me outside. I asked him how much alcoholic beverage he had consumed, and he stated that he consumed three bottles of Corona Beers at his friends house in Bel Air about an hour or two before the collision. I later identified the driver as Alfonso-Vazquez, Sergio, DOB 05/03/1974 and asked him to go back to his vehicle, to which he did.Alfonso-Vazquez later exited his vehicle the second time and started urinating in public right in front of my patrol vehicle on camera.      PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   Due to the overwhelming odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from Alfonso-Vazquezs breath, the admission to consuming alcoholic beverages an hour before the collision and the negligent manner of operating his vehicle resulting collision, on the highway, I had reasons to believe thatAlfonso-Vazquez was driving under the influence of alcohol. I requested an additional unit and upon arrival, I askedAlfonso-Vazquez to exit his vehicle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to which he complied. The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder in front of my patrol vehicle. The shoulder wasflat and free of any debris and the temperature was approximately 81 degrees.I askedAlfonso-Vazquez the following questions: Contacts-No,Glasses-No, andAny Injuries-No.Any medication: No.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my index finger was used as the Tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches fromAlfonso-Vazquezs eyes. Hewas instructed to look straight ahead, keeping hishead still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with hiseyes until told to stop. I asked himif he understood the directions and he advised yes. His pupils were equal in size and did show equal tracking.   Lack of Smooth Pursuit-present  The distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviationpresent  The onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degreespresent.  Vertical-present   WALK AND TURN (7/8) BeforeAlfonso-Vazquez performed the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel-to-toe. He was instructed to place hishands flat at hisside and to remain in the position until told to begin. Hewas advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. He was to keep his hands flat at hisside, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step, he was demonstrated and explained to keep hislead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around to hisleft with hisrear foot to turn completely around. He was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. He was then instructed that once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hisside, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud.  During the instructional stage:I explained and demonstrated the starting position toAlfonso-Vazquez andplaced him in thestarting position. Hecould notstand straight in the starting position. He broke hisfeet more than multiple times.He could not remain in the starting position before the instruction.  Walking stage (1st Nine).    Raised his arms more than 6 inches throughout the test.  Stopped walking on the 13thstep and asked a question.  Missed heel-to-toe by more than an inch  Stepped offline during the teststeps.  He took 13 steps.   Turn: The turn was unsatisfactory.Alfonso-Vazquez did not turn as instructed. He turned in one fluid motion instead of taking a small series of steps toward his left as he was instructed.  Walking stage (2nd Nine).    Raised his arms more than 6 inches throughout the test.     Missed heel-to-toe by more than an inch  Stepped offline during the teststeps.  He took 14 steps instead of 9.   ONE LEG STAND (3/4) Prior toAlfonso-Vazquez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to stand with hisheels together and hands down by hisside, while the instructions were given and during the test. He was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of hischoice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While hisleg was raised, he was to keep hisleg straight, watch hisraised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two), and to continue the test until told to stop.     He raised his arms during the test.  He swayed side by side during the test.  He put his foot down countless time   PRELIMINARY BREATH A preliminary breath test was explained and offered toAlfonso-Vazquez and voluntarily submitted to the test with a result of .18 Br Ac.  ARREST Based on the following, I havereasons to believe thatAlfonso-Vazquez was operating his vehicle while under the influence of alcoholand unable to operate safely resulting in a collision.    Extremely strong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath  Negligent driving resulting in two vehicle collision  Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages an hour or more before the traffic stop,   Observed signs of impairment as he performedthe Standardized Field Sobriety Tests unsatisfactorily.  I arrestedAlfonso-Vazquez at 1740 hours for driving his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.Alfonso-Vazquez listened to the Spanish audio version of DR-15 Advice of Rights in its entiretyin my patrol vehicle and at the conclusion, he voluntarily agreedtosubmit to the test. He signed the paper copy of the DR-15 at the barrack at 1804 hours. ItransportedAlfonso-Vazquez to the Maryland State Police, Bel Air barrack for processing.Alfonso-Vazquez also had an active warrant through the Harford County District Court for failure to appear.  20-MINUTES OBSERVATION PERIOD.
