         <NarrativeText>Defendant: Laflame, Ashley Marie Date of Arrest: 02/08/2023 License Number: 1358086 DUI Number: 23-039 Case Number: 23-MSP-004960 Recording: D-27 is equipped with MVR/BWC. Interaction was captured.  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: I am a certified police officer in the State of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection at the Maryland State Police Academy. My training has led to numerous arrests for impaired driving. I am trained by the Maryland State Police to administer standardized field sobriety tests. I am a certified Preliminary Breath Test operator through the Maryland State Police. I am a graduate of the Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement course (A.R.I.D.E.). I was recognized as a DUI Law Enforcement Awardee by the Maryland Highway Safety Office. I am a certified Advanced Collision Investigator through the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION: On 2/08/2023 at approximately 1602 hours I, TFC McMachan #6940 of the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks was on duty, and operating Maryland State Police marked patrol vehicle D-27. At this time, I was dispatched for report of a two vehicle motor vehicle collision in the area of westbound Churchville road prior to Glenville Road. I arrived on scene and observed a red Mazda CX-5 bearing Delaware registration PC211284 off road and in an embankment with extensive damage to its rear passenger side. I observed black Nissan Kicks bearing Maryland registration 2FF4462 with extensive damage to its front.  It should be noted I observed numerous empty bottles of barefoot pinot grigio in the trunk area of the Mazda. Furthermore, I observed a broken bottle of barefoot pinto grigio on the shoulder near the Mazda. I know barefoot pinto grigio to be an alcoholic beverage based on my training knowledge and experience as a Maryland State Trooper.  PERSONAL CONTACT: I made contact with personnel from Harford County Sheriffs Officer who advised he observed the operator of the Mazda, later identified through her Delaware issued drivers license as Ashley Marie Laflame (DOB: 08/22/1983 2/F), attempt to consume mouthwash when they arrived on scene. Furthermore, they advised Laflame stated she was traveling westbound on Churchville Road prior to Glenville Road. At that time, she attempted to make a U-turn to travel East on Churchville Road and the collision occurred.  I made contact with the operator of the Nissan, later identified through his Maryland issued drivers license as Ryan Joseph Kuhar (DOB: 11/24/2004 2/M). Kuhar advised he was traveling Eastbound Churchville Road just past Glenville Road. At that time, the Mazda appeared to turn directly in front of his vehicle. The front the Nissan struck the rear passenger side of the Mazda.  I made contact with Laflame and asked her what happened regarding the collision. Laflame advised I was trying to make a left and I got hit and thats all I remember honestly. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Laflames breath and person. Laflames eyes appeared to be bloodshot, watery and glassy. Furthermore, Laflames speech was slurred. I asked Laflame if she was operating the vehicle at the time of the collision to which, she stated yes. I asked Laflame where she was coming from this evening to which, she advised her husband had court earlier today, then they went to see his grandmother in the hospital and then attempted to get in contact with his aunt. Laflame added I went the wrong way so I was trying to make a U-turn in here and the car hit me. It should be noted there are no traffic signals where Laflame attempted to turn, and she failed to yield to oncoming traffic. I asked Laflame how much she had to drink today to which, she stared blankly at me. I, once again, asked Lafalme how much she had to drink today. Laflame advised I had wine at like nine oclock in the morning. I asked Laflame how much wine she consumed earlier today to which, she stated less than a glass. Laflame appeared to become irate and yelled this is not my fault.  Based off of my observations above, I requested Laflame perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to which, she stated whatever. Laflame then shouted Its the back of my car so clearly they operator couldve not hit the back of my car. Laflame added So if I went in front of them, they wouldve hit the front of my car.  I, once again, requested Laflame perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to which, she advised she had a head injury. It should be noted medical personnel were on scene with Laflame prior to my arrival. Laflame stated so you cant legally perform an actual sobriety test on me when I have shit going on.  Laflame advised she would not perform standardized field sobriety tests.  Due to the observations from above, I determined Laflame was unable to operate a vehicle safely and placed her under arrest for driving under the influence at 1631 hours.  Laflame was secured in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. I requested medical personnel check on Laflame. Laflame informed medical personnel she attempted to make a turn and the Nissan struck her vehicle. Laflame stated she hit the right side of her head on her vehicle. Laflame became irate and verbally combative with medical personnel on scene. Medical personnel informed Laflame they were trying to figure out what she hit the right side of her head on if she was the operator of the Mazda. While medical personnel were evaluating Laflame she continued to be verbally combative. She yelled oh my god youre fucking retarded. Medical personnel advised if Laflame was the operator of the Mazda, which she was, there was nothing the right side of her head would have struck at the time of the collision. Laflame was uncooperative with medical personnel and medics completed the medical refusal paperwork.  I transported Laflame to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks for processing.  I attempted to read the DR-15 Advice of Rights to Laflame in English. She was also provided a copy to read along. Prior to beginning to read the DR-15 Advice of Rights, Laflame stated what if I say I dont want to. Laflame advised she wanted medical attention once again. Laflame refused to submit to the evidentiary breath test at approximately 1725 hours.  Fallston Medic 13-1 responded to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks to evaluate Laflame. Laflame appeared to be more focused on whether she would be going to jail or have to come back to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks rather than the right side of her face hurting.  Laflame was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to the custody of Medic 13-1. Medic 13-1 transported Laflame to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.  I request this case be closed.     </NarrativeText>
