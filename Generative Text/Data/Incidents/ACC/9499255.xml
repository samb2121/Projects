         <NarrativeText>Navarro Sanchez, Jose - 23MSP029225 - 05P0YXP   Defendants Name: Navarro Sanchez, Jose Guadalupe  Incident Number: 23-MSP-029225  DUI Folder: 23-178  Date of Offense: 08-18-2023  Trooper J. Stallings #7589  Breath Tech Name  IBM: N/A  Subsequent Offender: No  Training/Certificates      I am trained and certified in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      Trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.     Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1)  On 08/18/2023 at approximately 1716 hours, I, Trooper Stallings #7589 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, was dispatched to a single vehicle collision on westbound John Hanson Highway at Robert Crain Highway. Upon my arrival, I observed a white BMW bearing Maryland registration 3FH3381 off road to the right with a light pole on top of the vehicle. The vehicle had heavy damage to the front bumper, damage down the driver side of the vehicle, as well as damage on the top of the vehicle. I later observed a beer can located approximately 10 feet from the passenger side door of the vehicle in some vegetation. Witnesses on scene advised me that they saw the driver (sole occupant) throw objects out of the vehicle.  Personal Contact (Phase 2)  I made contact with the driver of the white BMW who was being evaluated in the back of an ambulance on scene. The driver was later identified as Jose Guadalupe Navarro Sanchez (DOB: 12/28/1995) by his Maryland Drivers license. I asked Jose what happened and he advised me that he was just driving when a white vehicle struck him. Jose failed to give me a description of the vehicle, other than it being white. Jose also couldnt give me a good explanation as to what actually happened, other than a car striking him. I also asked Jose how many alcoholic beverages he had to drink, he stated he had two. After conducting my investigation of the accident, I concluded that Jose swerved to avoid a vehicle traveling in front of him, struck the unknown vehicle with the driver side of his vehicle, and then ran off road to the right and struck a light pole. While speaking with Jose I noticed bloodshot glossy eyes, slurred speech, and a strong odor of alcoholic beverages emanating from his breath and or person. Jose was later transported to Bowie hospital for possible injuries. While at the hospital, I explained to Jose that I wanted him to complete Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST), which he agreed to.   Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3)  The tests were administered in the waiting room of Bowie Medical Center. The surface was dry, level, and free of any debris. Jose appeared to be in good physical condition but he did advise me that he had some pain in his neck.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. It was held approximately 12-15 inches from Joses eyes, slightly above his eye level. Jose was instructed to follow the tip of the stimulus with his eyes without moving his head. Joses eyes were equal in size and showed equal tracking      Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes      Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes     Walk and Turn (2/8 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Jose was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe in a straight line. Jose was then instructed to place his hands down by his sides and remain in that position until told to begin. Jose was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. On the ninth step, he was instructed to keep his lead foot planted, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. After the turn, Jose was instructed to complete the second series of nine (9) steps in the same heel to toe fashion. Jose was instructed to keep his hands down by his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, count every step aloud, and once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed. I asked Jose if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  Jose completed the test barefoot.  Walking Stage (1st Nine)  Turn:  Jose completed the turn properly  Walking Stage (2nd Nine)      Jose raised his arms away from his body on step 2      Jose stopped walking to regain balance on step 2     ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated. Jose was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch the raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, etc) and to not put his foot down until the end of the test. I asked Jose if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:  Seconds 11-20:      Jose dropped his foot     Seconds 21-30:  PBT  Jose was offered a Preliminary Breathalyzer Test (PBT) on scene, which he did not agree to take.  Arrest:  Based on the above listed clues, observations, and detections from Jose, he was arrested at 1912 hours for driving while under the influence of alcohol. While at the hospital, Jose was provided with a copy of the DR-15 advice of rights and was played a spanish audio recording of the rights via the MVA website. At 1931 hours, Jose refused to submit to the intoximeter/blood test.  Release:  Jose was released to a sober driver at the hospital.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
