         <NarrativeText>On February 17, 2023, at approximately 1250 hours, the Annapolis Barrack Duty Officer was advised by the Glen Burnie Barrack a victim of a hit and run collision would be stopping by the Annapolis Barrack to report a hit and run collision. When the victim, who was identified by his Maryland Drivers License as Joseph Elvester Threatt 3rd, B/M, DOB: 4/14/2000, arrived at the barrack, I made contact with him out in the Annapolis Barrack parking lot. Threatt advised he was exiting from southbound I97 to eastbound Rt. 50 when a gray Ram pickup truck went onto the shoulder and tried to pass him, striking Threatts vehicle. Threatt had damage to his drivers side door. Threatt was able to obtain a tag of 9EE7317 on the Ram. When I ran the tag, it returned to Ram truck with a registered owner of Bryan Keith Satterfield, W/M, DOB: 7/12/1982. I was able to obtain a phone number for Satterfield and I called him to get his side of the story. When I spoke to Satterfield, he denied ever being in a collision. I asked Satterfield to come to the Annapolis Barrack, but he stated he was in Easton already. I advised Satterfield to go to the Easton Barrack. Satterfield agreed to go there.  I then called the Easton Barrack and spoke to the duty officer and he advised he would have a Trooper look at the truck and see if there was any damage. I spoke with the Trooper who looked for damage and he was not able to see any visible or obvious signs of the truck being involved in a collision. He stated there that since it was a work truck, there were scratched here and there, but nothing appeared to be fresh. I gave the Easton Barrack the case number to give to Satterfield.  ACRS report completed in Delta Plus.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
