INFORMATION FROM TANEYTOWN POLICE REPORT:     The following information came directly from the Taneytown Police Report and was included in this report due to the initial statements made to Taneytown Police Officers on the day of the incident.

BOCKELMANN stated that VERONIE showed up to the parking lot tonight and began making fun of another subject. BOCKELMANN stated that words were exchanged and BOCKELMANN asked VERONIE what he was carrying in his man purse. BOCKELMANN stated VERONIE pulled out a silver in color .357 pistol with a wood handle. BOCKELMANN stated VERONIE placed the pistol underneath his own chin and pulled the trigger. BOCKELMANN then stated that VERONIE then pulled the pistol from under his chin and pointed it at BOCKELMANNs chest and then began pointing the pistol at the crowd of people that were standing around BOCKELMANN. BOCKELMANN stated he then wrestled the pistol away from VERONIE and upon doing so was able to observe the pistol to have 4 bullets inside the ammunition cylinder. BOCKELMANN stated he then struck VERONIE in the face 3 times with his fist because VERONIE was attempting to grab the loaded firearm back from BOCKELMANN. BOCKELMANN stated he then removed the firearm from the crowd at which time VERONIE grabbed the pistol threw it in the back of his vehicle which was an H1 Hummer and proceeded to dump a full bag of trash in the parking lot before leaving.     This was then confirmed by Tyler Perdue, Christopher Reed and Mason Waltrip who witnessed the incident.     Perdue was able to provide me a full name of VERONIE, a vehicle description Green in color M1 Hummer that was possibly camolflauged and a tag number MD Dealer tag 1A98994.

Theodore Buck of the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division became involved with this case after the fact, per the request of Taneytown Police. The following is a breakdown of what was reported to Law Enforcement, other investigative efforts, and things I believe are related to the case.   Victim Interview     All the victims are listed above.   While there are some variations to the accounts, all victims reportedly VERONIE pulling a firearm out and pointed it at the crowd of people, as well as BOCKELMANN reported VERONIE pointed the firearm directly at his chest.   Additional information includes       Some witnesses indicatedVERONIE placed the firearm under his chin and pulledthe trigger.    VERONIE pointed the firearm at everyone at car meet when he waved the firearm around.    The description of the firearm also appears to be consistent.            Recorded Interviews at TPD     After learning about this case from PFC Marshall, I requested that the main parties involved be requested to come in for recorded interviews. Bockelmann, Reed, and Perdue initially showed up for interviews. Jackson agreed to come to speak with us after being contacted by one of the three victims who were already interviewed.      Interview of VERONIE.     Unable to make contact with VERONIE, so an interview could not be conducted.   I have left messages on both phones listed above,      Location of VERONIE after the incident.     Law Enforcement responded to VERONIEs registered address and the vehicle in question was not observed. At this time, it is not known where VERONIE went after the incident.      Potential of a search of VERONIEs registered address -11336 Hessong Bridge Road, Thurmont,MD.     A search of this property was not conducted, since there is no known information to indicate that VERONIE went back to the property after the incident. At the time of this supplement, it was determined that a search warrant was not appropriate.      Trash observed - supporting witness statements.     Yes. Included with Taneytown Polices report is a photograph of trash that was located at the scene. VERONIE reportedly dumped a bag of trash out on the ground while leaving the scene, after pulling out the firearm.      Firearms listed to VERONIE.     NONE. VERONIE is also under 21 years old, and should not be in possession of any style of handgun.      Firearms listed to the suspects father, Robert Nicholas Veronie.     MD Gun Center Information labeled MAFSS LIST. The following information should be confirmed with the Maryland Gun Center.       BER 950         Believed to be a Beretta 950.     Not a revolver.            SR 22 Charger         Believed to be a Ruger 22 Charger.     Not a revolver.            GLC 19         Glock 19 (9mm handgun)     Not a revolver.            SR Charger (22 Caliber)         Believed to be a Ruger Charger.     Not a revolver.                    Surveillance Video or Video of the incident.     No known video is available showing the incident or VERONIE pointing his firearm at other people.      Other victims/witnesses     As referenced above, other potential victims/witnesses were at the scene when the crime occurred.        Case Disposition:     At this time, I will be attempting to interview VERONIE. If no contact is made by September 8, 2023, I will proceed with applying for charges against VERONIE based on the statements made by the victims in this case. It should be noted that the Taneytown Police reviewed this case with the Carroll County States Attorneys Office, who advised charges were warranted.    Case OPEN.</NarrativeText>

Pratt Street, Suite 900    Baltimore, Maryland 21202    Office: (410) 385-2225    Direct: (410) 385-9105    Fax: (410) 547-2432 pseidel@silvermanthompson.com    Narrative:     Since the last update, I, Cpl. Theodore Buck of the Maryland State Police was notified that the suspect retained an attorney in the case listed above. I was advised that VERONIE did not want to provide a statement at this time. I did provide P. Seidel, Esq. a summary of the case information and requested that he ask VERONIE if he would like to provide the contact information for anyone I should speak with. When/if I am provided a list of names and can speak with them, any information learned will be included in a future supplement.       After reviewing the case information and the interviews, I confirmed with Assistant States Attorney S.

If any new information is learned, it will be included in the case file for review.     Case to remain OPEN.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>List of Attachments:    - None    Narrative:     As of October 18, 2023, I, Cpl. Theodore Buck of the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division have not heard from VERONIEs attorney about a list of names and contacts of VERONIE, who were at the truck meet. Additionally, I learned that VERONIE did not want to provide a statement. I was attempting to gain the other side of the story before contacting the witnesses already interviewed.     It should be noted that I provided P. Seidel, Esq, with a summary of the incident and my request to identify more people his client may know; however, as of 10/18/23, I have not received a response to this request.     On October 18, 2023, I contacted the witnesses listed below to arrange a time to conduct a follow-up interview with them. Additionally, I requested the names and contacts of everyone they knew at the scene of the incident in an attempt to identify more people. It should be noted that one of the founders of the meet-up put my phone number out to the group; however, I was not contacted by anyone.   List of People Contacted:      Logan Daniel BOCKELMANN (05/24/2004).     443-536-1736.      Christopher John REED (07/29/2004).     443-547-5265.
