         <NarrativeText>Narrative:  DUI: 23-135 Defendant: Elmer Antonio Morales Date of birth: 07/07/1989 Date of arrest: 05/01/2023 Time of arrest: 1531 hours MD License #:MD10273328314 TRAINING/CERTIFICATES      Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on December 5th-8th, 2022.      Trained in administering Preliminary Breath Tests through the Maryland State Police Forensics Science Division on December 9, 2022.     Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1):  There was no vehicle in motion due to this being the result of a motor vehicle collision. The defendant struck another vehicle in the rear. Personal Contact (Phase 2):  Upon my arrival of the scene I identified the driver of vehicle #1 as Elmer Antonio Morales (5/M, DOB: 07/07/1989) by his Maryland Drivers License. Morales was standing near the hood of a blue Nissan Titan with a blank stare on his face. It appeared Molares struck a black Toyota Corolla bearing Maryland registration 6CZ0637 in the rear-end. Morales was operating a blue Nissan Titan bearing Maryland registration 1EX6663.When I asked Morales to retrieve his license, registration card, and insurance card, he looked confused. He spoke English the entire time, so I knew it was not due to a language barrier. Morales was moving slow and lethargic when retrieving the items I requested from him. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath when talking to him about the accident. I asked Morales if he consumed any alcoholic beverages before driving, and he advised that he did have 1 beer. Morales eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I asked Morales to take Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, and he agreed.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3): The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of the highway. The weather was clear and cold, approximately 55 degrees. Lighting conditions were dark. The ground was level and free of any debris. My patrol vehicles overhead emergency lights in the front were deactivated prior to field sobriety tests as well as the vehicles spotlight. Morales was wearing a winter jacket. Morales was wearing flat heeled shoes. Morales appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injuries.  I asked Morales the following questions:  Medical Conditions: Stomach issues Medications: Yes, for stomach issues Glasses or contacts: No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from his eyes. Morales was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Morales pupils were of equal size and showed equal tracking.  Morales displayed the following clues:    Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes   WALK AND TURN TEST (3/8 clues observed) Prior to Morales performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted.Morales was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary line. Morales was instructed and demonstrated to place hishands flat at hissides and to remain in that position until told to begin.Morales was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Morales was instructed to keep hishands flat at his sides, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Morales was explained and demonstrated to keep hislead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with hisrear foot to the left to turn completely around.Morales was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Morales was instructed that once she began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hissides, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud.  Instructional Stage:    Cannot keep balance during instruction  Starts too soon   After explaining the instructions, Morales started to take the test twice, however advised he was not going to take the test.    ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed)  Morales advised he did not want to complete this test either.  Preliminary breath test (PBT): Offered and accepted PBT resulted were .29  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Morales was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting fromhis breath  Eyes glassy and bloodshot  Clues observed during field sobriety  Admission of consuming alcoholic beverages   Morales was arrested at 1531 hours. Morales was transported to the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack. At approximately 1556 hours, Morales was read the DR15 advise of rights which was played aloud in the barrack via the MVA website. Morales agreed to take the intoximeter examination test at 1604 hours. Due to insufficient breath samples, Morales was pressed as a refusal. Morales was given the appropriate citations and was released to his significant other at 1720 hours.    All of the above events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.        </NarrativeText>
