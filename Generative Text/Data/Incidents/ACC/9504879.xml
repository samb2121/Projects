         <NarrativeText>Supplemental Narrative  On 09/09/2023 at approximately 2305 hours,I, Trooper Woodworth #7681, was on duty and operating in my official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper, was dispatched to a motor vehicle collision involving a bicyclist. I arrived on-scene at approximately 2336 hours and observed the bicyclist laying on the right side of the southbound lanes of US Route 1 and the striking vehicle parked around a few hundred feet in front of the bicyclist. I then made contact with the driver of vehicle 1, who I later identified as Yvette LaTrice Hill (W/F DOB:07/11/1967)by her Maryland drivers license. I obtained a written statement of events from Hill and obtained insurance information for vehicle 1. I then provided Hill the case number and barrack phone number and returned Hills drivers license and vehicle registration. I then completed the ACRS report for the incident.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Emlid Reach RS+ Mapping Supplement</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Emlid Reach RS+ Mapping Supplement     Section I. - Narrative  On Saturday, September 9, 2023, at approximately 2305 hours, the Prince Georges County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) notified the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack of a report of a motor vehicle collision involving a bicyclist that occurred on the southbound side of Baltimore Avenue (US 1), north of Ammendale Road, Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland. The Maryland State Police College Park Barrack dispatched Trooper Kory Woodworth #7681 and Trooper Jason Strine #6972, an Advanced Collision Investigator (ACI), to respond to investigate the collision. Upon Trooper Woodworth and Trooper Strines arrival, they identified the following vehicle and people involved:   2013 Hyundai Sonata displaying Maryland registration 6CA7057     Driver - Yvette Latrice Hill (DOB: 07/11/1967)          Bicyclist/deceased - Ongeri Justice Michieka (DOB: 08/14/1991)  Prince Georges County Fire Department/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel responded to the collision scene. Fire Fighter/Paramedic Lieutenant Ward #20278 pronounced Ongeri Michieka deceased on the scene at 2314 hours. While Trooper Strine was conducting his investigation, he notified me, Sergeant Kevin Zarzecki #6202, assigned to the Maryland State Police Crash Team, to respond to assist with the scene investigation.  Upon my arrival, I was tasked with forensically mapping the collision scene utilizing my agency-issued Emlid Reach RS+ Global Positioning System (GPS) total station. The following supplement report documents my activities as part of the investigation and assistance to Trooper Strine.  Section II. - Investigation  Upon my arrival to the collision scene, I made contact with Trooper Strine, who provided me with an update as to the status of the investigation. I then began to conduct a scene walk through so I could observe and locate any scene evidence. I then began to forensically map the collision scene utilizing my agency-issued Emlid Reach RS+ GPS total station. During the mapping, all 36 of data points from the Emlid Reach RS+ GPS Base and Rovers solution status was fixed. The coordinate system used was North American Datum 1983 (NAD83) Maryland (ftUS). NAD83 is a geocentric datum and geographical coordinate system based on the 1980 Geodetic Reference Sytem ellipsoid (GRS80) which is mainly used in North America, its measurement are obtained from both terrestrial and satellite data.  Section III. - Diagram Creation  On Monday, September 11, 2023, I created two (2) scaled diagrams utilizing the exported comma-separated values (CSV) file. The CSV file was imported into FARO Zone computer aided design software to create both scaled diagrams: (1) with labels and (1) with measurements. The scaled diagrams were saved in .FAR and PDF file formats.  Section IV. - Attachments that were included in for this report:  The following items were attached to this report:    Diagram, drawn to scale - labels  Diagram, drawn to scale - measurements  The following items have been archived in the Crash Team files:    .FAR diagram file  Emlid Reach RS+ CSV file  Emlid Reach RS+ DXF file  Emlid Reach RS+ DXF with labels file    Conclusion:  The area of impact (AOI) was determined to be in the area where there was scattered food from 7-Eleven in a grassy area between the curb and the asphalt pathway. The distance from the AOI to the position of uncontrolled final rest of the bicycle/bicyclist was 52.84 feet in length. The distance from the AOI to the position of controlled final rest of the Hyundai was 188.58 feet in length. Lane number 1 was 10.29 feet wide. Lane number 2 was 11.15 feet wide. Lane number 3 was 14.50 feet wide.  Upon approval, this report will be provided to Trooper Strine to utilize as part of his investigation.

         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report  (For review by the MSPCrash Team)       Section I. - Introduction:  On 09/09/23, at approximately 2305 hours, The Maryland State Police College Park Barrack received a call for a bicyclist struck on the southbound side of US Rt. 1 in the area of Ammendale Rd. Trooper Woodworth #7681 responded to the scene and upon arrival, he observed a black Hyundai Sonata bearing Maryland registration 6CA7057, and the body of the bicyclist in lane 3 on the southbound side of US Rt. 1. Prince Georges County Fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived on the scene and Lt Ward #20278 of Station 41 pronounced the bicyclist deceased at approximately 2314 hours.  Due to the nature of the collision, I (Trooper First Class Strine #6972) an Advanced Collision Investigator (ACI), was requested to assume the investigation. At approximately 2332 hours, I arrived the on scene to begin processing and documenting the scene. Section II. - Scene Description: (The following descriptions are based on the area where the collision occurred.)  Primary Roadway: US Rt. 1 at Ammendale Rd. was an undivided highway that traveled in a north/south direction. The southbound lanes were separated from the northbound lanes by a center turning lane marked with dotted and solid yellow lane markings. The southbound side of US Rt. 1 was a three lane highway. Lane three was separated from lane two by Type 1 Dotted Lane Markings, indicating that the lane was not a continuous lane of travel and would be ending after a right turn. The road markings appeared to be bright and in good condition. The road surface was wet and appeared to be free from any contributory defects. The posted speed limit was 50 miles-per-hour.   Environmental Conditions: The weather conditions at the time of the collision were overcast skies, rainfall was present earlier in the day. Due to overcast skies, no moonlight illumination was present. No additional lighting was present.   Section III. - Scene Evidence: Upon arrival, I observed a bicyclist lying in lane 3, and a black Hyundai Sonata stopped ahead of the bicyclist in lane 3. I surveyed the scene to locate, identify, and analyze any roadway evidence which would be useful in the investigation. No tire markings were present on the road, but I was able to locate pieces of the shattered passenger side headlight determined to have been from the Hyundai Sonata. The pieces of debris appeared to be traveling in a straight line from the area of impact (AOI) from the bicyclist to where the Hyundai came to a controlled final rest. Trooper Woodworth collected a written statement from the driver of the black Hyundai who was identified as Yvette Latrice Hill (O/F DOB: 07/11/1967). The bicyclist was later identified by his Maryland drivers license as Ongeri Justice Michika (B/M DOB: 08/14/1991).    Section IV. - Vehicle(s) Involved:  Vehicle #1: 2013 Hyundai Sonata (VIN: 5NPEC4AC9DH650399)  The black Hyundai Sonata was displaying Maryland registration 6CA7057. The vehicle was registered toYvette Latrice Hill (O/F DOB: 07/11/1967)  Damage present on the Hyundai initiated on the passenger side front bumper area consistent with that of an impact with the rear of a bicycle. The passenger side headlight area had the headlight lense cracked with pieces of the lense broken off of the headlight. Damage on the passenger side hood area consistent with that of a human body indented into the hood, as well as damage to the passenger side front windshield and B pillar was present. The damage on the windshield was consistent with damage from a head strike upon the windshield.  Section V. - Person(s) Involved:  Person #1: Yvette Latrice Hill (O/F DOB: 07/11/1967)  Hill was the driver and sole occupant of the black Hyundai Sonata. Hill advised that she was traveling south on US Rt. 1 when she was being tailgated by another vehicle in lane 2. Hill stated that due to the vehicle following her very closely, she changed lanes from lane 2 into lane 3. After changing lanes, the vehicle then passed her on the left, and began changing lanes from lane 2 into lane 3 directly in front of her. The vehicle entered almost fully into the lane directly in front of Hill and began applying its brakes. Hill began braking to avoid colliding with the vehicle, when the vehicle then quickly changed lanes from lane 3 back into lane 2. Upon changing lanes, Hill advised as the other vehicle was still splitting lane 2 and lane 3 she heard a loud bang, and observed the bicyclist striking her windshield.  Person #2: Ongeri Justice Michika (B/M DOB: 08/14/1991).  Michika was traveling south on US Rt. 1 in the area of Ammendale Rd., on a bicycle in lane 3. Michika was struck by the black Hyundai Sonata operated by Yvette Hill. Michika was pronounced deceased by Lt Ward #20278 of Station 41 at approximately 2314 hours. Michika was wearing blue jeans and a navy blue jacket. Michikas bicycle did possess a rear red light reflector, but no additional lighting or reflective devices were present on Michika or the bicycle. Michika was not wearing a helmet. Forensic Investigator Trasee Cosby responded to the scene, and transported Michika to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) located in Baltimore, Maryland, so an autopsy could be conducted. The OCME case number was #23-11160 Section VI. - Follow-up Investigation:  Date: On 9/22/23 I received the Autopsy Report from Jessika Logan, of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The Report stated the cause of death was multiple injuries, with the manner of death listed as accident.   Section VII. - Analysis of Electronic Control Modules:  Due to the dynamics of the collision, the airbags did not deploy. No airbag Module (ACM) data was retrieved.   Section VIII. - Speed Analysis:  Due to the dynamics of the collision, no speed analysis was conducted.  Section IX. - Crash Dynamics:  The black Hyundai Sonata, displaying Maryland registration 6CA7057, operated byYvette Latrice Hill was traveling south on US Rt. 1 in the area of Ammendale Rd. Due to the evidence and the nature of the incident, it appears Michika was riding the bicycle in lane 3 of the roadway, which was the furthest right lane available for travel. Hill advised she was distracted by another driver and vehicle which possibly blocked her field of view to the entirety of lane 3 where Michika was traveling. Hill struck Michika causing Michikas body and the bicycle to travel up and over the passenger side of the black Hyundai. Michikas body made initial contact with the right front quarter panel and headlight area of the vehicle, before Michikas head then struck the top passenger side of the windshield. Michikas body and bicycle then came to a rest on the right side of lane 3, against the curb and drainage grate.  Section X. - Attachments that were included in for this report:  The following items were attached to this report:  -ACRS Report  Attachments that were included in this report: Forty-six (46) digital photographs were taken and uploaded to VeriPic Digital Evidence System.  Conclusion: The following conclusions are based upon the totality of this investigation including the statements of the persons involved, the physical evidence accumulated, as well as the reports submitted by other investigators concerning this incident. My rendering of these conclusions is based upon my training in the field of collision reconstruction.  On 09/09/23 at approximately 2305 hours, a black Hyundai Sonata displaying Maryland registration 6CA7057, operated byYvette Latrice Hill, was traveling south on US Rt. 1 in the area of Ammendale Rd. when she struck a bicyclist, identified asOngeri Justice Michika, who was traveling in lane 3. When struck by the black Hyundai, Michika was thrown over the top passenger side of the vehicle, which was traveling in lane 3 of the 3 lane highway, and onto the drainage grate and curb along the right side of the roadway. According to The Maryland Vehicle Law Annotated Code TA 21-1205, Michika was operating in accordance with Maryland Vehicle Law by riding as near to the right side of the roadway as practical. In addition, Michika was not in accordance withThe Maryland Vehicle Law Annotated Code TA 21-1207 (i), which states when operating in insufficient light or unfavorable atmospheric conditions, a front lamp that emits white light discernible at 1000 feet must be present. Michika also was required byThe Maryland Vehicle Law Annotated Code TA 21-1207.1, to at all times wear a helmet when operating a bicycle on any highway open to the public for vehicular traffic. On 09/22/23 I, Trooper First Class Strine #6972, received a copy of the Autopsy and Toxicology Report from The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The report states that the Autopsy revealed multiple significant blunt force trama injuries. The postmortem toxicology report for drugs and alcohol were both negative. The manner of death is Accident.  Upon approval this case will be presented to the Office of the States Attorney for Prince Georges County. A supplement will be completed for any additional investigation or charges.       TFC J. Strine Maryland State Police Rockville 7915 Montrose Rd Rockville, MD 20854 301-424-2101</NarrativeText>
