         <NarrativeText>DUI ARREST Case Number: 23MSP001754 Defendant: Devin Logan Howard Date of Birth: 05/09/1995 Date of Arrest: 01/15/23 Time of Arrest: 0359 VA License #: A61473325 DUI #: 23-004  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES      I am trained and certified in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      Trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.      VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 01/15/2023 at approximately 0325 hours, I, Trooper Stallings #7589 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, was dispatched to a single vehicle collision on the ramp from southbound I-95 to northbound I-495 in College Park, Prince Georges County, Maryland. Upon my arrival on the scene, I observed a black Ford Fusion bearing Virginia registration (VXS1017), overturned off the right shoulder behind the guardrail. There were no other vehicles involved in the collision.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was later identified as Devin Logan Howard (DOB: 05/09/1995) by his Virginia drivers license. Howard was standing outside of his vehicle. I asked Howard what happened with the crash. Howard stated that he was sleepy and veered off the side of the road. I then asked Howard where he was headed to, he replied that he was headed home. I asked Howard where he was coming from and he said that he was hanging out with friends in Baltimore, Maryland. I asked Howard if he was injured in any way and he stated that he was not. EMS arrived on the scene shortly after my arrival to check on Howard. Howard was asked numerous times by myself and EMS staff if he was injured or needed medical assistance and he replied with, No. While speaking with Howard, I noticed that his eyes were glassy and bloodshot and I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and or person. Howard was then asked how much he had to drink, which he stated four shots. Howard was asked how long ago he consumed those drinks and he stated about an hour ago. I asked Howard to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The test was performed on the right shoulder of southbound I-95 at northbound I-495. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of the street lights, my flashlight, and my vehicles headlights. Howard appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, other than a minor hand injury that he was provided a bandage for. My vehicles forward facing emergency lights were deactivated during the tests.  I asked Howard the following questions prior to beginning the test:  Glasses or Contacts  Contacts Medical Conditions  None Injuries  None Medication  Adderall  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)   The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. It was held approximately 12-15 inches from Howards eyes, slightly above his eye level. Howard was instructed to look straight ahead, keep his head still, and follow the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Howard was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Howards pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.      Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes      Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes     Resting nystagmus was not present. Vertical nystagmus was present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed)   The test was explained and demonstrated. Howard was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary straight line. Howard was then instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and remain in that position until told to begin. Howard was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. On the ninth step, he was instructed to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. After the turn, Howard was instructed to complete the second series of nine (9) steps in the same heel to toe fashion. Howard was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, count every step aloud, and once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed. I asked Howard if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  Howard performed this test wearing boot-like footwear.  Instructional Stage:      Howard failed to maintain the instructed position     Walking Stage (1st Nine)      Howard took 10 steps (step 10 he stumbled)      Howard missed heel to toe on steps 2,4,5      Howard stepped off line on steps 2 and 4      Howard raised his arms more than 6 inches away from his body on steps 2 and 4     Turn:   Howard completed the turn in a satisfactory manner.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine)      Howard missed heel to toe on step 9     ONE LEG STAND (4/4 clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated. Howard was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch the raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, etc) and to not put his foot down until the end of the test. I asked Howard if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:      Dropped his foot      Raised his arms away from his body      Swaying to try and maintain balance      Hopping to maintain balance     Seconds 11-20:      Dropped his foot      Raised his arms away from his body      Swaying to try and maintain balance      Hopping to maintain balance     Seconds 21-30:      Raised his arms away from his body      Dropped his foot     PBT:   Howard was offered a Preliminary Breathalyzer Test (PBT) on scene, which he refused.  ARREST:   Based on the above listed clues, observations, and detections from Howard, he was arrested at 0359 hours. A search incident to arrest was conducted and no contraband was located. Howard was then transported to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack. Upon arrival at the barrack, a secondary search was conducted, and no contraband was located during the search. Howard was provided a copy of the DR-15 advice of rights. At 0434 hours refused to submit to the intoximeter test.  Release:   Howard was released to a sober driver from the barrack.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
