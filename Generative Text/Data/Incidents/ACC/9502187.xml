         <NarrativeText>RECORDED ON BODY WORN CAMERA SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER: NO ACCIDENT: YES  NARRATIVE:  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):  On 12/17/2023 at approximately 0312 hours, I Trooper (Tpr.) Glessner #7395 of the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, was dispatched to the Greenbelt Metro Station for an accident that occurred on S/B I-495 in the area of Greenbelt Metro Station. Upon my arrival, I identified one of the vehicles as a silver Chevy Malibu (TN/AJ3017).  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2): At that time, I made contact with the driver of the Chevy Malibu, who I identified as Francis Nathaniel Toluwase Keryordeh (11/11/2000) by his Tennessee Drivers License. Keryordeh advised the striking vehicle didnt remain at the scene of the accident to exchange information. He also stated he was unable to get the vehicles tag information or the description. In speaking with Keryordeh, I immediately detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. His speech seemed slurred as he spoke. I also noticed Keryordehs eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I then asked Keryordehs how much he had to drink and he stated one or two beers. I asked Keryordeh where he was coming from and he stated from Laurel. I then advised Keryordeh to perform a series of field sobriety tests at the front of his vehicle. I asked Keryordeh again how much he had to drink and he replied two drinks at 8 oclock. When asked to rate his sobriety level 1-10 (1: Sober  10: Drunk), Keryordeh replied one. At the front of his vehicle, I asked if he had any physical or medical disabilities, Keryordeh stated he has a little limp on his right hip. I asked if Keryordehs if he takes any medication, he stated no. While outside of the vehicle I could continue to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST: (6/6 CLUES) The first test I explained to Keryordeh was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. Keryordeh then stated he understood the test. As I began the test, I observed Keryordehs pupils were of equal size and his eyes tracked equally.  1. Lack of smooth pursuit- present in both eyes.  2. Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation- present in both eyes. 3. Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees- present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN TEST: (5/8 CLUES)  The next test I conducted with Keryordeh was the Walk and Turn test. The test was conducted using the paved portion of the shoulder that was level and clear of debris. For the instructional portion of the test, Keryordeh was asked to stand with his right foot in front of his left in a straight line. After Keryordeh was placed in the starting position placing his right foot in front of his left, I advised him not to move until I instructed him to start. During my demonstration Keryordeh broke heel to toe contact twice. After completion of my demonstration, Keryordeh began his first series of steps.  Walking Stage (1st nine steps) 1. Missed heel to toe contact on steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 17, and 20.  2. Steps off line on steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, and 17. 3. Stops walking on step 4. 4. Took a total of 22 steps. The Turn- Proper.   Walking Stage (2nd nine steps) 1. Missed heel to toe contact on steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 21, and 23.  2. Steps off line on steps 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 21, and 23. 3. Stops walking on step 23. 4. Took a total of 24 steps    ONE LEG STAND TEST: (4/4 CLUES) Next I explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Keryordeh. Upon completion of my demonstration, Keryordeh advised he understood the test. I asked which foot he was going to pick up and he replied right. Keryordeh began by raising his right foot.  1. Paced foot down during the 30 second test. 2. Swayed from side to side during the 30 second test. 3. Had arms raised during the 30 second test. 4. Hopped during the 30 second test.    PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT): I then returned to my vehicle (Q-28) to retrieve my preliminary breath test instrument (PBT). I explained to Keryordeh the reason for using a PBT and he refused to give a breath sample.    ARREST:  Keryordeh was then taken into custody at 0351 hours. At that time I placed Keryordeh in my vehicle. Keryordeh was then transported to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack for further processing. I advised Keryordeh of his DR-15 Advice Of Rights by MVA recording and paper copy. After hearing the recording, Keryordeh agreed to submit to the breath test at 0434 hours. The breath test was administered at 0444 hours which revealed a result of .17 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath collected. Sgt. James Smith of the Maryland State Police administrated the breath test. After issuing Keryordeh all the appropriate paperwork and citations, he was then released to a sober driver at the barrack.  All events did occur in Prince Georges County, Maryland. Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
