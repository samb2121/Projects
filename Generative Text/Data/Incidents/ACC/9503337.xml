         <NarrativeText>In-Car camera and body worn camera operational.  On 03/04/2023, at approximately 0430 hours, I, Tpr. Tripp #7333 with the Maryland State Police La Plata barrack responded to a single motor vehicle collision with injuries at Mattawoman Beantown Road in the area of Poplar Hill Road, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland. Upon arrival, EMS was on scene (AMB 79) and I observed a silver Saab 9-3 bearing Maryland registration, 9EY7904, overturned into the grass off of Mattawoman Beantown Road. The driver was laying approximately 25 feet away from the vehicle. I made contact with the driver, who I identified through the Maryland State Police Emergency Dispatcher (MSPED), Cpl. Meurrens #6372, as Boswell 4th, William Edward (W/M, DOB:07/17/1997). Boswell was conscious, alert, and breathing. While speaking with Boswell, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and person. During the entirety of this incident, Boswell was repeatedly vomiting. Once Boswell was taken inside of AMB 79, he then admitted to having two drinks and his father advised he came from a nightclub in District of Columbia (DC). Lt. Gorman #4223 with Potomac Heights Paramedic units also advised the repeated vomiting is caused by alcohol poisoning. Lt. Gormanadvised that Boswell sustained life-threatening injuries to his head, back, hip, and pelvis. Boswell was transported to University of Maryland Capital Regional Medical Center for further treatment.  At 0504 hours, Advanced Collision Investigator (ACI), TFC Englemen #7197 was contacted and en route to the scene to investigate the collision. At 0557 TFC Englemen arrived on scene of the single vehicle collision. TOP towing responded to the scene and towed the vehicle.  Due to Boswells injuries, Standardized Field Sobriety Test was not conducted.  On 03/05/2023, at approximately 0557 hours, I made contact with Charles County States Attorneys Office, via email requesting Boswells blood records.  I request this case to remain open pending summons/blood records.  All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland.   </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>In-car camera operational, T-6. BWC utilized.   On March 4, 2023, at approximately 0431 hours, the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack responded to the area of MD RT. 5 (Mattawoman Beantown Road) at Popular Hill Road, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland 20601 to investigate a motor vehicle collision. Upon arrival of the Charles County Sheriffs Office, at approximately 0438 hours, they discovered a sedan which was overturned in a ditch next to MD RT. 5. Deputies reported the driver was alert, conscious, and breathing after being ejected from his vehicle during the collision. While on scene, the driver was being tended to by EMS for life-threatening injuries to his pelvis and femur according to EMS personnel. Upon Troopers arrival, the driver was identified as William Edward Boswell 4th (W/M DOB: 07/17/1991). Boswell was identified by his MVA photograph. Troopers on scene requested an ACI respond to the scene due to the injuries sustained by the driver.   I, TFC Engleman #7197 was requested to respond for ACI. I arrived on scene at approximately 0557 hours and began ACI procedures as a precaution.   A preliminary investigation revealed that a Saab sedan was traveling southbound on MD RT. 5 from a slight left sweeping turn approaching Popular Hill Road, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland 20601. At that time, the Saab failed to negotiate a turn in the roadway and for unknown reasons crossed the white shoulder line and left the roadway to the right. The vehicle entered a grass covered ditch and rolled multiple times during the collision events. Multiple indentations were discovered in the mud where the vehicle rolled. The vehicle came to an uncontrolled final rest on his roof. The vehicle was identified as a two (2) door soft top convertible Saab 9-3 bearing Maryland registration 9EY7904. During the collision events, Boswell was ejected from the vehicle and was thrown ahead of where the vehicle came to an uncontrolled final rest. The roadway was wet from a previous rainstorm, however, the roadway was clear from any debris or obstructions.   Tpr. Tripp #7333 explained to me, he began speaking with Boswell when he arrived on scene and detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Boswells breath and person and was vomiting. See Tpr. Tripps initial report for further information regarding Boswells impairment (Reference 23-MSP-008067).   Boswells next of kin was on scene and made the initial 9-1-1 call of the incident. I spoke with Boswells aunt, Crystal Evonne Naumoff (W/F DOB: 05/25/1965) on scene. Naumoff was identified by her Maryland drivers license. Naumoff stated she received a Life360 alert at 0406 hours advising her Boswell was involved in a vehicle collision. Naumoff stated she arrived on scene between 0415 and 0420 hours and located Boswells vehicle overturned in the ditch and observed he had been ejected from the vehicle. Naumoff stated Boswell was alert and conscious and speaking with her the entire time she was on scene.   The scene was photographed and measurements were obtained. From the time the Saab left the roadway into the grass shoulder and later entered the steep slope of a ditch it traveled 78.2 feet. Tire marks in the mud indicated the Saab traveled an additional 44 feet across the slope of the ditch prior to the first indentations from the vehicle in the mud. Approximately seven (7) large indentations were observed in the grass/mud where the Saab likely rolled during the collision events prior to coming to an uncontrolled final rest on its roof 260.4 feet from where it first left the roadway. Boswell was located an additional 36.7 feet ahead if his vehicle in the grass. It is unknown at what point during the collision events Boswell was ejected from the vehicle. There was no evidence of blood or severe trauma left in the grass where Boswell was found, however, pooling of vomit was located next to where Boswells head was.   It should be noted, no vehicles were stored for this investigation. Traffic was diverted around the collision scene and a partial blockage of lane 2 was maintained by Troopers from the La Plata Barrack. The Charles County States Attorneys Office was also notified via this response sheet and by Tpr. Tripp via email.   Boswell was transported to University of Maryland Capital Region Hospital Center (CRMC) with traumatic injuries via ground transport as aviation was down due to weather.    On March 4, 2023, at approximately 0844 hours, I contacted CRMC via telephone and spoke with a representative from the trauma department who advised Boswell was stable and is expected to survive. I was advised Boswell was going to be moved to the ICU for recovery.  This completes my portion of the investigation, no further crash investigation needed. This case remains open pending supplement and charging by Tpr. Tripp.  All of the above events occurred in Charles County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
