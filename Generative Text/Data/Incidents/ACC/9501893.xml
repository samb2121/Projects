         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM* MVR Statement: The following incident was captured on in-car and Body camera. Title: 23-MSP-041537. ID: 23-MSP-041537 Arrested: McCorkle, Charice Victoria. Certification and training  -Trained in Field Sobriety Test through Maryland State Police Academy.  -Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E)  -Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  - Graduated from The Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies Driving Under the Influence Institute-University of Maryland.  - I am a certified EC/IR II Intoximeter operator.  - I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor.  - I have apprehended more than 270 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On November 23, 2023, at approximately 0042 hours, I, TFC. I. Riba Tankari # 7058 with Maryland State Police was traveling westbound MD-150 (Eastern Blvd) east of Old Eastern Avenue, Baltimore County, Maryland in lane #1 (left lane). My issued patrol vehicle is Maryland State Police unmarked unit DUI-6. At that time, I observed a white GMC Acadia bearing Georgia temporary registration S1699368 stationary at a red circular traffic light prior to the stop line approximately vehicle length in the intersection of westbound MD-150 and old eastern Avenue in lane #2. After the light turned green, I observed the GMC continued traveling westbound MD-150. I observed the GMC had crossed the dotted white line from lane #2 into lane #1 by one tire width on two separate occasions and appeared to be traveling over the posted speed limit. I changed lane into lane #2 and with my properly functioning patrol vehicle Golden Eagle II radar unit set activated, I obtained a speed reading of 62 in a posted 35 MPH zone. I continued to follow the GMC and observed the vehicle had changed lane into lane #1 before coming to a stop at a red circular traffic light in the intersection of westbound MD-150 and Seamaster Road prior to the stop line by approximately two vehicles length. At that time, I observed a gray Toyota Highlander bearing 6DY4220 stopped beside the GMC and the driver of the Toyota appeared to be arguing with the GMC driver. I observed the GMC had proceeded traveling and crossed the solid white line from lane #1 into the left turning lane and stopped partially between the two lanes before continued traveling in the left turning lane and came to a stop. I activated using my emergency equipment to initiate traffic on the GMC. I observed the GMC proceeded traveling before coming to a stop in the intersection of westbound MD-150 and Seamaster Road, Baltimore County, Maryland in the left turning lane passing the stop line by approximately more than vehicle length. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the GMC on the driver side and noticed no one was sitting in the driver seat and made contact with male passenger sitting in the front passenger seat, a male passenger sitting in the rear passenger seat, and a female appeared attempting to sitting in the rear passenger seat from the front seat with her legs still on the vehicle center console. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I asked them who the driver was and the male in the rear stated he was driving and moved to the driver seat. I insisted asking the female who was driving the vehicle and on one occasion she stated me. At that time the driver of the Toyota who stated the GMC had struck his vehicle drivers side rear view mirror identified the female as of the driver of vehicle. I requested the driver and the passenger to exit the vehicle. The female passenger refused to sit in the driver seat, sat on the curb, and continued to deny driving, but she later admitted driving. I requested her drivers license and registration card. The driver stated she does not have her license and provided her drivers license soundex number. While outside her vehicle, I observed that the driver had glassy eyes and noticed her speech was mumbled. The driver was identified through an MVA check of the Soundex as McCorkle, Charice Victoria. I returned to my patrol vehicle and notified the barrack who I was out with. An MVA check of the driver revealed she has no drivers license or privilege to drive in Maryland. I returned to the GMC and requested her insurance card, but was unable to provide her insurance information. While outside her vehicle, I explained to McCorkle the reason for the traffic stop, and she stated Thats why I was trying to get away from him, He was following me for about three miles. While speaking with McCorkle outside her vehicle, I again detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. I asked McCorkle to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, and she agreed.  The evaluation surface was dry, flat, and free of debris. No surface defects were observed. My patrol flashlight, my patrol vehicle headlights, and surrounding lightning lit the area. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. McCorkle appeared to be in good physical conditions. I asked McCorkle the following questions: Medical conditions: No Medications: No. Anything that will prevent you from walking on straight line or standing on one leg: No Glasses or contact: No glasses but was wearing contacts. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: (6/6 clues observed). The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus - Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Notes: * During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from McCorkles breath. WALK AND TURN: (4/8 clues observed). The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. McCorkle stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage: McCorkle lost her balance to the right on two separate occasions. Walking Stage (1st Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than half inch on counts 1, 2, and 4. Turn: The turn was not completed correctly; instead McCorkle turned to her left failing to take a series of small steps as instructed and demonstrated. Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than half inch on counts 3 and 5. Stepped completely offline by one shoe width on count 6. One Leg Stand Test (2/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. McCorkle stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Right foot raised during the test. Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: Swayed body to the right and left. Raised arms more than six (6) inches from her side for balance. Seconds 11-20: Swayed body to the right and left. Seconds 21-30: Swayed body to the right and left. Preliminary Breath Test:  I explained and offered a PBT to McCorkle. McCorkle elected to consent to the PBT and results were .13 BAC. Notes *While PBT was loading results, I asked McCorkle how many alcoholic beverages she had consumed, and she stated I had like three shots. I asked her shots of what, and she stated Don Julio. I asked her around what time, and she stated around ten thirty. ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe McCorkle was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely:  -Driving over the posted speed limit (62 Mph in 35 Mph speed limit zone)  -Driver at fault was involved in a motor vehicle collision.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from vehicle.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath as she conversed with me.  -Glassy eyes.  -Her admissions to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving.  -Observed signs of impairment as she performed the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  - Preliminary Breath Test result of .13 BrAC.  McCorkle was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a motor vehicle at 0122 hours and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack. Upon arrival at Barrack, McCorkle was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, and it was read to her from the MVA website in English, and she elected to consent to the Intoximeter EC/IR II test at 0147 hours. 20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with McCorkle beginning of her arrest. She remained in my custody from the time of her arrest. Nothing was introduced to her mouth at any time. A search revealed that she had nothing in her mouth. The test was conducted by Sgt. Zinn Intox ID #5496 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument and a result of .12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath was obtained at 0204 hours. McCorkle was polite and cooperative during the encounter. McCorkle was given pertinent paperwork and released from the Barrack to her Mother pending an appearance in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County at a later date.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
