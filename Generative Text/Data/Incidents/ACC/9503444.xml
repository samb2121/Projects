         <NarrativeText>INCIDENT CAPTURED BY BWC AND MVR  ATTACHMENTS:  Copy of Arrest Intake Copy of Statement of Probable Cause 23 Digital Still Photographs Uploaded to VeriPic  COMPLAINANT:  Gina Maria Cook 720 Littlestown Pike Apt B Westminster, MD 21157 W/F DOB: 11/23/1978 443-289-1544  STATEMENT: Cook stated that on 1/27/2023 at approximately 0500 hours, Ogan arrived at her residence and began to converse with her. Cook allowed Ogan to enter the residence and they began to talk. Cook stated that Ogan is her ex-husbands sisters husband. Cook advised that eventually she wanted Ogan to leave her residence. Cook requested that Ogan leave, and he began to refuse. Cook stated that Ogan eventually pinned Cook down on the floor for approximately 10-15 minutes. Cook advised that Ogan did not attempt to grope her, otherwise sexually assault her, nor attempt to asphyxiate her at any time while he was on top of her. Cook stated that she attempted several times to remove Ogan from on top of her without success before manipulating his genitalia with her hands in order to free herself. Cook then informed me that after she freed herself, Ogan went into the bathroom and showered while she called 911 to request a police response. Cook denied having any physical injuries that were sustained from the assault. Cook further denied any type of medical assistance being needed on the scene. Cook advised that Ogan finished his shower and then laid on the floor nude but covered by the blanket until police arrived. Cook stated that on the night of 1/24/2023, she had awoken to Ogan laying in her bed with her. Cook advised that she did not fall asleep with him there and that he was not in the residence prior to her falling asleep. Realizing all of this, Cook requested that Ogan leave the residence to which he complied. After Ogan left, Cook realized that Ogan had apparently broken a glass pane on her rear door and let himself into the residence. Cook stated that before Ogan left, she told him that he was not allowed at her residence anymore. Cook further stated that she did not call the police when this happened because she was able to get Ogan out of the residence peacefully. Cook advised that she does not like to get police involved in personal matters unless absolutely needed. Cook informed me that she wanted Ogan trespassed from the property and did not want him at her residence anymore. See BWC Interview for further.  ACCUSED:  Larry Ray Ogan 3323 Niner Road Finksburg, MD 21048 W/M, DOB: 4/02/1950 443-381-4748  STATEMENT: Ogan stated that Cook had texted him at approximately 0300 hours on 1/27/2023 requesting that he bring over a television to her apartment. Ogan advised that he arrived at approximately 0500 hours and was allowed into her residence. Ogan stated that he and Cook began conversing normally, but then Cook started acting crazy. Ogan advised that he attempted to restrain Cook in order to protect himself and her from any harm occurring. Ogan stated that he might have been stabbed by Cook during the altercation. Ogan stated that shortly after, police arrived at the residence. See BWC Interview for further.   SCENE PROCESSING:  I photographed the apartment as well as Cooks person and clothing that she was wearing. I also photographed Ogans person, clothing, and apparent injuries sustained from the altercation. I observed Ogan to have a laceration on his neck and on his left pectoral muscle near his armpit. I further observed several wounds on his hands. These injuries appeared to be caused by Cooks hands. No injuries appeared to be from a knife. I took 23 digital still photographs.  NARRATIVE:   On 1/27/2023 at approximately 0703 hours, the MSP Westminster Barrack received a phone call in reference to a 77-year-old male refusing to leave the complainants apartment. The caller stated that she resides at 720 Littlestown Pike Apt B Westminster, MD 21157.   I arrived at the residence at 0716 hours and contacted the involved parties. As I entered the residence, I observed a male subject laying on the floor nude but covered by a blanket. I also observed a female subject fully clothed and observed blood to be on her hands and clothing. I identified the complainant as Gina Maria Cook (W/F DOB: 11/23/1978) by her MD Drivers License. I then identified the male subject as Larry Ray Ogan (W/M DOB: 4/02/1950) by his MD Drivers License. I then collected the above captioned statements.   After interviewing both Cook and Ogan, completed the above captioned scene processing.   Prior to my departure, Ogan was informed that he was no longer permitted on the property nor at Cooks residence and that his return to either would result in criminal charges. Ogan advised that he was confused about the instructions and that he wished to retrieve his property that was allegedly in Cooks residence. Ogan was refused reentry into Cooks residence and referred to the court system to recover his property. Ogan left on foot walking southbound on Littlestown Pike. It was later discovered that Ogans vehicle was still on the property. Ogan was also referred to the commissioners office for charges against Cook.   Cook was referred to the commissioners office to seek a protective order against Ogan. Cook was informed that charges would be filed on her behalf in this matter. Cook was instructed to call 911 if Ogan returned to the property at any time.   On 1/27/2023 at approximately 0924 hours, Cook called the MSP Westminster Barrack and informed us that Ogan had returned onto the property and attempted to enter her residence. I arrived at the residence and was unable to locate Ogan or his vehicle. Cook stated that Ogan had again attempted to enter the residence through the back door and broken door. Cook advised that Ogan was unsuccessful in entering the residence. While on the scene, I was able to confirm through her neighbors video doorbell that Ogan returned to the property at 0917 hours.   On 1/27/2023 at approximately 1011 hours, Cook called the MSP Westminster Barrack and informed us that Ogan had returned onto the property. I arrived at the residence and was unable to locate Ogan or his vehicle. On this occurrence, Cooks neighbor called the MSP Westminster Barrack and again confirmed that Ogan had been seen on their video doorbell. While on scene, I made contact with the landlord for the property who I identified as Joseph Jay Fiorani (W/M DOB: 3/22/1956) by his MD Drivers License. Fiorani advised that he confronted Ogan while he was on the property and told him twice that he was no longer allowed back onto the property or at Cooks residence. Fiorani stated that Ogan had previously asked him to cut up pieces of wood that were to the rear of the property and that Fiorani originally granter permission for Ogan to do so prior to Fiorani having knowledge of the above captioned incidents. Fiorani advised that once he learned of the incident and made contact with Ogan, he revoked his permission to retrieve the wood and to be on the property at all.   On 1/27/2023 at approximately 1154 hours, Cook called the MSP Westminster Barrack and informed us that Ogan had returned onto the property. I arrived on scene and observed Ogan and his vehicle to be in the back of the property near several logs of wood attempting to cut them. It was at this time I placed Ogan under arrest and transported him to CCDC.    On 3/15/2023, the case was adjudicated and Nolle Proseque finding was added.  I request this investigation be closed for a lack of prosecution.  Case Closed Via One Adult Arrest.  All events occurred in Carroll County, MD. CASE CLOSED </NarrativeText>
