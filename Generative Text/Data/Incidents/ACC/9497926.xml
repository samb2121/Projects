         <NarrativeText>Patrol Vehicle S-22 is equipped with an in-car camera/recorder, and body cam.  Weather: Clear 50 degrees  Defendant: Laxton II, Melvin, Ronny Date of Birth: 5/29/91 Date of Arrest: 2/19/23 Time of Arrest: 0001                                                      License#: MD 2FF7504 DUI #S-23-011 Centreville  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  N/A Vehicle was involved in a single vehicle accident.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  Once the driver had refused EMS (Emergency Medical Services) I made contact with the operator, identified by his Maryland drivers license as, Melvin Ronny Laxton II(W/M 5/29/91), who was standing at the rear of a Queen Anne County Sheriffs Office vehicle. The suspects vehicle had failed to stop at stop sign and crossed over Rt 18 and impacted an embankment and become disabled in a field with heavy front end damage. The vehicle, a gray 2016 BMW X5, bearing Md registration 2FF7504. When asked, Whats going on tonight...you alright...you need EMS? Laxton responded, I dont need anything No im not injured. When asked where he was coming from, Laxton advised, My car is right there gesturing to his car in the field. Laxton displayed clear signs of impairment while communicating to me. When asked, How much have you had to drink tonight? Laxton hesitated and advised I dont know When asked where he was coming from, Laxton advised he wasnt from the area...that he was visiting a friend Laxton was asked what his middle name was, and he advised Laxton, then when asked what his last name was. He advised Laxton. Laxton clearly showed signs of confusion. Laxton asked me a question. He asked, What is going on with the complications at this moment? He was advised that he was in a wreck, and that his vehicle needed to be towed, and that he was under the influence and I was going to put him through SFSTs. Again Laxton was asked if he had any injuries, which he advised he had none.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the roadway in front of MSP marked Unit S-22. The surface was dry, andfree of any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of S-22 headlights and my flashlight. Laxton was wearing soled shoes and appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  HGN was conducted using my finger for the stimulus. The stimulus was passed horizontally at a distance of 12-15 inches and slightly above eye level across Laxtons face. During the instructions I made it clear to Laxton to keep his head still and to only follow the stimulus with his eyes. I then checked for equal tracking and equal pupil size. During the test, Laxton had difficulty keeping his eyes focused on my finger and follow with only his eyes. He was instructed multiple times to follow with only his eyes. Laxton demonstrated lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximumdeviation, and an onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.  WALK AND TURN (8/8 clues observed)  Prior to Laxton performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I placed Laxton into the instructional position. Laxton had difficulty understanding instructions and was instructed multiple times. Laxton was then instructed to place his right foot in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. I demonstrated and instructed Laxton to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Laxton was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Laxton was to keep his hands flat to his side. To keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step, I demonstrated and explained Laxton to keep his lead foot on the line, and make a series of small steps around his lead foot with his rear foot to turn completely around and begin the second series of nine steps. I again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be identical to the first series. Laxton was instructed tokeep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. Laxton attempted to begin before instructions were completed. During the initial 9 steps Laxton held hands out from side and missed heel to toe on every step, and stepped off-line on every step while holding his hands in front of himself. Laxton took 10 steps. Laxton completed the turn unsatisfactory. He did not turn on the correct foot or take small steps around the lead foot. During Laxtons second 9 steps, hemissed heel to toe and stepped offline on every step. Laxton took 11 steps. Laxton held his hands in front of himself the whole time.  Instructional Stage:  1.)Started too early  Walking Stage (1st Nine):  1.)Hands held in front of him for balance 2.) Missed heel to toe on every step 3.) Stepped offline on every step 4.) Took 10 steps 5.) Failed to count each step out loud   Turn: Unsatisfactorily Turned on wrong foot without taking steps around the lead foot.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine) 1.)Hands held in front of him for balance 2.) Missed heel to toe on every step 3.) Stepped offline on every step 4.) Took 11 steps 5.) Failed to count each step out loud  ONE LEG STAND (OLS) (4/4 clues)   Prior to Laxton performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Laxton was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. Laxton picked up his right foot and immediately put it back down. He then reattempted, but fell to his left. He attempted again before falling to his left. For Laxtons safety the test was stopped.  Instructional Stage:  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: 1) Foot down  Seconds 10-20:  Seconds 20-30:  1.) Test was stopped for his safety    PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT)  Laxton refused PBT    ARREST    Based on the following, I had reason to believe Laxton was driving a motor vehicle while impaired.  * Alcoholic beverage odor emanating from breath  * Performance on SFSTs  The DR-15 was audibly read to Laxton in MSP Marked Unit S-22, to which he agreed to intoximeter test. Laxton was transported to MDTA Bay Bridge for intoximeter testing.  Intoximeter result: .23  I request this case be closed by arrest.  All of the above events occurred in Queen Anne County Maryland </NarrativeText>
