         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report (For review by the MSPCrash Team)    Section I. - Introduction:  On Sunday March 26, 2023 at approximately 1506 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack responded to a two vehicle collision in the area of northbound Maryland Route 136 (Whiteford Road) at Maryland Route 646 (Prospect Road) in Harford County, Maryland.  During the course of the investigation it was revealed that a silver 2011 Toyota Rav4 bearing Maryland registration 9FF4029 was traveling northbound on Prospect Road traveling south from the intersection of Whiteford Road. The driver of the Toyota was identified as Elijah John Palm (W/M, DOB 12/06/2002). At that time, a tan Ford F-450 bearing Maryland registration 3CS8926 was traveling northbound on Whiteford Road approaching the intersection of Prospect Road. The operator of the Ford was identified as William David Wilhelm Junior (W/M, DOB 04/02/1959). The Toyota failed to stop at the clearly posted stop sign and traveled directly into the traveling path of the Ford. The Toyota was struck on the right side by the Ford. The Toyota spun counterclockwise approximately 45 degrees leaving the roadway to the right side. The Toyota struck the embankment then a wooden telephone before coming to final rest in the right side field on Whiteford Road, north of Prospect Road. The Ford began a clockwise spin approximately 180 degrees leaving the roadway to the right side. During the spin, the Ford struck a standing stop sign and an embankment. The passenger in the Toyota was identified by name and date of birth as the following: Isiah PalmW/M DOB: 09/25/2008 *JUVENILE* (Fatal Injury). The passenger in the Ford was identified by name and date of birth as the following: William David Wilhelm 3rdW/M DOB: 10/22/2004 (Uninjured).      Section II. - Scene Description: (The following descriptions are based on the area where the collision occurred.)  Primary Roadway:  Whiteford Road (Maryland Route 136) was a State of Maryland State Highway Administration maintained roadway and was constructed of asphalt. Whiteford Road was a paint line divided roadway, with north and south travel lanes. Whiteford Road was posted at 50 miles per hour in the area of the collision. The section of Whiteford Road was not under construction and there was no road debris. The roadway was dry. At the time of the collision, traffic was light.  The travel lanes of Whiteford Road in the area of the collision consisted of one northbound and one southbound lanes with a shoulder area on each side of the roadway. The northbound and southbound lanes were divided by a yellow painted lane divider. The shoulders were divided by a white solid painted line.The edge of the roadway was an eased asphalt edge terminating into soil.  I measured the northbound lane, southbound lane and each shoulder. I measured the northbound shoulder from the edge of the asphalt to the middle of the solid white painted fog line which measured approximately 11 and 11. I measured the northbound lane from the middle of the solid white painted fog line to the middle of the solid double yellow painted lane divider which measured approximately 12 and 2. I measured the southbound lane from the middle of the solid double yellow painted lane divider to the middle of the solid white painted fog line which measured approximately 12. I measured the southbound shoulder from the middle of the solid white painted fog line to the edge of the asphalt which measured approximately 10 and 11.   Secondary Roadway:  Prospect Road (Maryland Route 646) was a State of Maryland State Highway Administration maintained roadway and was constructed of asphalt. Prospect Road was a paint line divided roadway, with north and south travel lanes. Prospect Road was posted at 30 miles per hour in the area of the collision. The section of Prospect Road was not under construction and there was no road debris. The roadway was dry. At the time of the collision, no traffic was traveling in the area on Prospect Road.  The travel lanes of Prospect Road in the area of the collision consisted of one northbound and one southbound lanes. The northbound and southbound lanes were divided by a yellow painted lane divider. The edge of the roadway was defined with a solid white painted line and an eased asphalt edge terminating into soil. There was a solid white painted stop bar line on the northbound travel lanes just south of the intersection to Whiteford Road.  I measured the northbound lane and southbound lane of Prospect Road. I measured the northbound lane from the middle of the solid white painted fog line to the middle of the solid double yellow painted lane divider which measured approximately 11 and 11. I measured the southbound lane from the middle of the solid double yellow painted lane divider to the middle of the solid white painted fog line which measured approximately 12 and 2.  Prospect Road had a standing stop sign for the northbound traffic. While traveling northbound there was a stop sign ahead warning sign south of the intersection of the collision. The stop sign and stop sign ahead sign were not obstructed. I measured from the moment of stop sign perception to the location of the stop sign which measured approximately 505 and 7. I measured from the stop sign ahead to the AOI which measured approximately 497 and 6.   Third Roadway:  Prospect Road (Harford County Route 0118) was a Harford County Department of Public Works maintained roadway and was constructed of asphalt. Prospect Road was a paint line divided roadway, with north and south travel lanes. Prospect Road was posted at 30 miles per hour in the area of the collision. The section of Prospect Road was not under construction and there was no road debris. The roadway was dry. At the time of the collision, no traffic was traveling in the area on Prospect Road. Prospect Road had a standing stop sign at the intersection for southbound traffic.  The travel lanes of Prospect Road in the area of the collision consisted of one northbound and one southbound lanes. The northbound and southbound lanes were divided by a yellow painted lane divider. The edge of the roadway was defined by an eased asphalt edge terminating into soil.  I measured the northbound lane and southbound lane of Prospect Road. I measured the northbound lane from the asphalt edge to the middle of the solid double yellow painted lane divider which measured approximately 15. I measured the southbound lane from the middle of the solid double yellow painted lane divider to the asphalt edge which measured approximately 11 and 9.  Environmental Conditions:  The weather was clear. The temperature was approximately 64 degrees Fahrenheit.    Section III. - Scene Evidence:  I began walking the scene on Whiteford Road going from south to north. I observed set of skid marks that appeared to be pre impact due to their position on the roadway. The skid marks went from south to north and were parallel. The skid marks began small and would widen with length. These marks were produced by the rear left dully tires on the Ford. I observed four (4) additional skid marks that went from Whiteford Road extending to the shoulder area and then off-road. An area of impact (AOI) was determined by the placement of the un-tampered post impact debris trails, pre- and post-impact skid marks and the position of both vehicles uncontrolled final rest.  The position of final rest for the Toyota was marked and measured. The Toyotas front left tire measured approximately 223 and 7 from the AOI. The Toyotas front right tire measured approximately 217 and 6 from the AOI. The Toyotas rear left tire measured approximately 213 and 10 from the AOI. The Toyotas rear right tire measured approximately 210 and 11 from the AOI. I observed a gauge in the dirt embankment from the Toyota. The gauge measured approximately 11 in its entirety. The Toyota traveled approximately 66 and 3 from the AOI to the pole that it impacted. The Toyota then traveled approximately 95 from the pole before coming to the position of final rest.  The position of final rest for the Ford was marked and measured. The Fords front left tire measured approximately 70 and 11 from the AOI. The Fords front right tire measured approximately 68 and 7 from the AOI. The Fords rear left outer tire measured approximately 85 and 8 from the AOI. The Fords rear right outer tire measured approximately 83 and 11 from the AOI. The Ford then traveled approximately 17 and 5 from the AOI before coming to the position of final rest. I observed two (2) gauges in the dirt from the Ford. The gauges were both extended from Whiteford Road towards the front for the Ford. The first gauge was measured and was found to be approximately 10 and 5 in its entirety. The second gauge was measured and was found to be approximately 18 and 5 in its entirety. The scene was measured in its entirety from the beginning of pre-impact evidence to the Toyotas position of final rest which measured approximately 233.  In the area that the collision occurred, there are no businesses that are immediately surrounding the intersection. There was a home within immediate sight of the area of the collision, 2001 Whiteford Road. I contacted the female homeowner asking if there were any cameras that would have captured the collision and I was told no.  The scene was documented with digital photographs taken by myself. The scene was marked utilizing orange colored florescent paint and measurements of the evidence was captured.

Date: 03/28/2023 Sergeant Rumaker #5661 authored a search warrant for the Toyotas collision data. The warrant was granted Honorable Judge Clara Campbell and the warrant was executed on March 30, 2023.  Date: 03/30/2023 On Thursday March 30, 2023 I was notified of the passing of Isiah Palm by Sergeant Stec #5182. I was provided with the information for the Medical Examiner. I was advised Medical Examiner Gray Maggard was fielding the case (ME Case #23-04122) and was I requested to contact Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.  Date: 03/31/2023 I contacted Medical Examiner Maggard via telephone. I was advised that Isiahs injuries and death were well documented and there was no intention to complete an autopsy for this case.     Section VII. - Analysis of Electronic Control Modules: Sergeant Rumaker conducted a vehicle download from the Toyota and Fords EDR module. Refer to Sergeant Rumakers supplemental report for data.    Section VIII. - Speed Analysis: Sergeant Rumaker conducted speed analysis for the acceleration rate for the Toyota. His analysis shows that the Toyota could reach a speed of 23.4 MPH (50% acceleration) to 33 MPH (100% acceleration) from the stop line/bar to the Area of Impact (AOI). The time of stop to AOI was from 3.6 seconds (50% acceleration) to 2.5 seconds (100% acceleration). The Refer to Sergeant Rumakers report for further information.     Section IX. - Crash Dynamics:  Vehicle 1 (Toyota) was traveling northbound on Maryland Route 646 (Prospect Road) south of the intersection of Maryland Route 136 (Whiteford Road). Vehicle 2 (Ford) was traveling northbound on Maryland Route 136 south of the intersection of Maryland Route 646. Vehicle 1 failed to stop at the clearly posted stop sign traveling into the direct traveling path of Vehicle 2. Vehicle 2 collided with Vehicle 1 on its right side. From the impact Vehicle 1 spun counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees leaving the roadway to the right, striking the dirt embankment then a wooden utility pole. Vehicle 1 then traveled through a grass field coming to a position of uncontrolled final rest. From the impact with Vehicle 1, Vehicle 2 spun clockwise approximately 180 degrees, leaving the roadway to the right, striking a standing stop sign and coming to a position of uncontrolled final rest in a grass ditch.     Section X. - Attachments that were included in for this report:  The following items were attached to this report: 1) Automated Crash Report (ACRS MSP658800VZ) 2) Witness Statements 3) MSP Form 062  90 photos 4) Vehicle Storage Reports 5) MSP Form 078 6) Diagram prepared by TFC. Dill #6465      Conclusion:  The following conclusions are based upon the totality of this investigation, to include, the review of the documents provided to date from assisting investigators and the physical evidence accumulated. These conclusions are based upon my training, knowledge and experience as an advanced collision investigator.  During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that Elijah John Palm was traveling northbound Prospect Road (Maryland Route 646) south of Whiteford Road (Maryland Route 136) in a silver 2011 Toyota Rav4. William David Wilhelm Junior was traveling northbound on Whiteford Road (Maryland Route 136) south of Prospect Road (Maryland Route 646) in a tan 2017 Ford F-450. Palm did fail to stop at the clearly posted stop sign. Due to this, Palms vehicle entered the direct traveling path of Wilhelm. Wilhelm subsequently struck the Toyota on its right side causing the Toyota to spin counter clockwise approximately 90 degrees and the Toyota leaving the roadway. The Toyota struck the embankment and a wooden utility pole before coming to a position of uncontrolled final rest in a grass field. The Ford spun clockwise approximately 180 degrees and the Ford leaving the roadway. The Ford struck a standing stop sign and came to a position of uncontrolled final rest in a ditch.  Medical Examiner Gray Maggart ruled the manner of death accident and determined Isiah Palmdied of injuries sustained as the occupant of the Toyota involved in a collision.  Through my investigation I found that Elijah John Palm is responsible for the motor vehicle collision by failure to stop at stop sign (TA 21-707 a) and driving vehicle on highway at speed exceeding limit 51/30 (TA 21-801.1).  Uponapproval of this case, it will be presented to the Office of the States Attorney for Harford County. A supplement will be completed for any additional investigation or charges.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.  Authored by: Trooper First Class Matthew Dill #6465 Bel Air Barrack 1401 Belair Road Bel Air, Maryland 21014 410-838-4101 </NarrativeText>
