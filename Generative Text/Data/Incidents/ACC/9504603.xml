         <NarrativeText>*Bodycam was online and operational*  DUI # 23-231  Trooper Z. Shai ID # 7463  Maryland State Police  Forestville Barrack L    CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING:  - NHTSA Certified to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST)  - Certified Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) operator    DESCRIPTION OF VIOLATION / INCIDENT / TRAFFIC STOP (VEHICLE IN MOTION):  On July 30, 2023, at approximately 0205 hours, I, Trooper Shai #7463, was dispatched to northbound Crain Highway in the area of Matapeake Business Drive in Prince Georges County for a three vehicle collision that was in the roadway. Upon my arrival, I observed a white BMW X4, bearing Maryland registration NELYTZ, in front of that vehicle I observed a Honda CRV bearing Maryland registration T1424002, and a Hyundai Elantra bearing maryland registration UKG4518, all vehicles were stationary in lane 2.      INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEFENDANT (PERSONAL CONTACT):  I made contact with the driver of the BMW X4, I immediately asked the driver if she needed any medical attention due to the collision, which she declined. I then requested her drivers license, registration, and proof of insurance. The driver searched her wallet for several minutes and could not find any of her vehicles information or her identification. I then requested her name and date of birth. I identified her as Neion Ter Ray Snowden (B/F: DOB 08/26/1973) after confirming her identification through METERS/NCIC. While speaking to Snowden, Iimmediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on her breath and person. I also observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I asked Snowden about the circumstances of the collision and she responded by claiming she was traveling in lane 2 when traffic abruptly stopped for the red light. Throughout our interaction,Snowden had difficulty balancing while standing and walking normally.Snowden slurred her speech and when asked where she was coming from Snowden stated she was coming from a party.Snowden advised that she had consumed a double shot of Crown Royal Whiskey around 0100 hours and was headed home to Suitland, MD. I asked Snowden to take Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which she accepted.      PRE-ARREST SCREENING  Glasses or Contacts - None.  Medical Conditions - Sciatica.  Injuries - None.  Medication - None.   Standardized Field Sobriety Tests   ***** Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus - 6 of 6 clues  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Snowdens eyes. She was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes until told to stop. Her pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. She was positioned on a flat surface on the shoulder. Snowden was asked if she understood the test and the instructions to which she stated, Yes.  - Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes - Distinct nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes - Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes   ***** Walk And Turn - 5 of 8 clues  Prior to performing the test Snowden was positioned on a flat surface on the shoulder. I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Snowden was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. She was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. She was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line that she was instructed to imagine, touching heel to toe on every step. She was instructed to keep her hands flat at her sides, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Snowden was explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around. Snowden was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. She was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her sides, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud.   First 9 steps:  - Cannot keep balance during instruction portion - Started before instructions were completed - Steps off line - Does not touch heel-to-toe for steps 1-9  Second 9 steps:  - Uses arms for balance - Does not touch heel-to-toe for steps 10-18 Upon completion of the walk and turn test, Snowden spun around and took a bow.  ***** One Leg Stand - 3 of 4 clues  Prior to Snowden performing the test, Snowden was positioned on a flat surface on the shoulder, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. She was instructed to stand with her feet together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised she was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot, and to count out loud and to continue the test until told to stop. Snowden was asked if she understood the test and the instructions to which she stated Yes   1s to 10s  - Swayed - Put foot down  11s to 20s  - Put foot down  21s to 30s  - Uses arms for balance - Swayed - Put foot down   ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Snowden was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  - Striking another vehicle  - Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her body and breath  - Slurred speech  - Stumbling  - Performance on SFSTs   At approximately 0255 hours, I placed Snowden under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. Snowden was placed in the front passenger seat of my marked patrol vehicle, as per department policy, and transported to the Maryland State Police Forestville barrack. Snowdens mouth was checked at 0305 hours and nothing was found. Snowden was advised of her DR-15 Advice of Rights via audio recording and was provided a physical copy to read along with. She subsequently refused to submit to the intoximeter test at 0330 hours.    INTOXIMETER RESULT:  **** Refused ****    Snowden was given copies of all pertinent paperwork and released to a valid and licensed driver.    All events listed above occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.    Case closed due to arrest. </NarrativeText>
