BODY AXON CAMERA: https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=31fc7156bc294b9a93d79cfe16633d94partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1 https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=a4968a7e0ebe4458974094a6c318a231partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  NARRATIVE: On July 22, 2023, at approximately 2102 hours I, Trooper First Class Graves #7199, was dispatched to 7570 Fentral Avenue, Salisbury Wicomico County Maryland 21801 for a possible shots fired. Upon my arrival to the scene I made contact with the complainants who I would identify as Nakisha Banks (1/F DOB:01/15/1981), Nyquez Banks (1/M DOB:07/26/2006) and Kaniya Bratten (1/F DOB:03/10/2010).  While speaking with the victims all three would inform me they were laying down for bed when they had heard loud bangs/gun shots from the front of the residence and afterwards had immediately called 911.  Troopers conducted neighborhood checks and would speak with neighbors in the surrounding area - Fentral Avenue: 7574- Male Subject identified as Douglas Brown (1/M DOB:11/10/1967) advised house cameras facing away from crime scene, heard the gun fire but did not observe anything. 7564- 1/Female advised she did not observe anything, heard the gun shots, but house does not have cameras. 7558- No answer at the residence, does have cameras (unknown if operational)  Brent Avenue: 7562- - 1/Male advised he did not observe anything, heard the gun shots, but house does not have cameras. 7559- - 1/Female advised she did not observe anything, did not heard the gun shots and house does not have cameras.  Upon further observation of the crime scene I would observe approximately 3 bullet holes on the front face of the residence. I would also observe one hole in the rear windshield of the vehicle parked in the driveway of the residence (a black Hyundai Sonata bearing Maryland registration 6ED4307). Inside the vehicle I would observe a fist-sized rock resting in the backseat/trunk area.  While continuing my observations of the crime scene I would observe that a bullet appeared to have traveled through a wood pillar of the front porch, the front glass window (now shattered), the front wooden door, struck an outlet in the living room and the bullet was observed resting on the floor of the living room near the front door.  A bullet hole was also located in the bedroom window of Kaniyas bedroom, the bullet appeared to have traveled through the window, the bedroom wall and into another door of a closet in the residence.I would also observe a bullet hole next to the bullet hole of the glass door/wood door area. In total 3 bullet holes on the face of the residence were located.Troopers on scene would also locate a single handgun bullet casing in the grass area approximately 10 feet from the rear of the vehicle in the driveway.  All occupants remained in the living room area and crime scene tape was placed around the house. During the course of investigation Kaniyas father would arrive on scene, later identified as Keonte Bratten Sr. (1/M DOB:05/05/1989) to check on the condition of Kaniya and then would leave shortly after.  Due to the circumstances of this incident I requested both Criminal Enforcement Division and Crime Scene Tech to respond to the location for further investigation.  Crime Scene Techresponded to the scene at approximately 2206 to collect evidence and photographs of the scene.  Criminal Enforcement Division responded to the scene at approximately 2242 hours to conduct further investigation.  I request this case be forwarded to CED for further investigation  All events occurred in Wicomico County Maryland. </NarrativeText>

Narrative:   On 7/22/23 at 2102 hours, I, M/Tpr. A. Edwards, was dispatched to 7570 Fentral Ave, Salisbury, Wicomico County, MD 21801 for a report of shots fired into a residence. When I arrived on scene, I initially positioned by vehicle in a manner to prevent any further traffic from traveling on Fentral Ave to preserve any possible evidence in or around the roadway. I made contact with TFC Wilkins and TFC Graves who had arrived on scene prior to me and was advised the residence had been struck by several bullets and the rear window a vehicle that was parked in the driveway was able broken. I immediately observed the glass of the front exterior door of the residence to be shattered with a large amount of glass on the porch and on the door sill. I observed a bullet hole in the lower portion of the front storm door and was advised by the homeowner that the bullet had traveled through the door and struck an electrical outlet along the wall immediately behind the door. It appeared that the bullet had fallen to the floor right below the outlet. I observed an additional bullet hole in a bedroom window that was to the left of the front door. TFC Wilkins was able to locate one bullet casing in the front yard of the residence near a tree. I marked the casing with a note card in order to keep it from being disturbed or moved.    I observed the damage to the vehicle in the driveway and believed it was not from a bullet hole. There was a large hole approximately two inches in diameter in the middle of the window. I looked through the glass and observed what appeared to be a piece of a brick that was approximately the same size as the hole in the glass. I entered the residence and entered the bedroom in which the bullet had entered the window. I was able to observe a hole in the rear bedroom wall at a similar height to the bullet hole in the window. It appeared that the bullet had traveled through the bedroom wall and traveled into the hallway where it traveled through a closet door and into a large plastic bag in the closet. I did not remove the plastic bag in order to preserve evidence that would be later processed by crime scene technicians. I briefly spoke with the homeowner, Nakisha Banks and she advised that her son was friends with a juvenile who had recently been murdered a few weeks earlier. Banks advised that she believed that could be the only reason that someone would want to shot at her residence. She was unable to confirm any of that information and advised that her son or daughter were not involved in any illegal activity that would have lead to the shooting. I advised Banks that criminal investigators and crime scene technicians were en route to the residence to conduct the investigation and that investigators would conduct a more detailed interview with her when they arrived.    Based on the nature of the incident, I complete two MSP form 78 (Consent to Search and Seize) forms with Banks for her residence and vehicle in order to process them and collect evidence related to the crimes. Banks gave written and verbal consent for her residence and her vehicle. I provided the consent for to TFC Mingos.    Once investigators from the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region and crime scene technicians from the Maryland State Police Forensic Sciences Division arrived on scene, I maintained security of the scene security until the vehicle and residence were processed for any evidence.    I request this case remain open pending further investigation by criminal investigators. CASE OPEN.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText> On July 22, 2023, at approximately 2102 hours, [9:02 p.m.], Troopers with the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack responded to 7570 Fentral Avenue, Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland 21801 for a report of shots fired. Upon arrival, Troopers made contact with the victim(s), Nakisha Banks, DOB: 1-15-1981, Nyquez Banks, DOB: 7-2-2006, and Kaniya Bratten, DOB: 3-10-2010, [hereinafter referred to as Nakisha, Nyquez and Kaniya].   According to Nakisha, Nyquez and Kaniya had just turned in to go to bed when they heard loud bangs/gunshots from the front of the residence. They immediately called 911. Due to the nature of the incident the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region were notified and assumed the investigation.   Upon arrival, Investigators observed that a bullet appeared to have traveled through a wood pillar of the front porch, the front glass door, the front wooden door, struck an outlet in the living room and the bullet was observed resting on the floor of the living room near the front door. Investigators also observed that the rear windshield of the victims vehicle, black Hyundai Sonata, had a hole in the rear windshield. Located inside the vehicle was a large rock. A single 9mm shell casing was located in the grass area approximately 10 feet from the rear of the vehicle in the driveway. A bullet hole was also located in the bedroom window of Kaniyas bedroom. The bullet appeared to have traveled through the window, the bedroom wall and a closet door inside the residence.   Investigators learned while speaking with Kaniya that her brother, Karontez Bratten, DOB: 2-28-2007, [hereinafter referred to as Karontez] received a text message via Instagram at approximately 1700 hours, [5:00 p.m.] on July 22, 2023 from Instagram account hittafrmupdaway that said he was going to shoot up his house where Kaniya lives.   Investigators made contact with Karontez who identified the Instagram user as Bryant Thomas Brown-Clark, DOB: 10-19-2006, [hereinafter referred to as Bryant]. Karontez told investigators that there has been tension between him and Bryant as a result of other shootings which have occurred recently in the Salisbury, Maryland area.   While on scene, Kaniya viewed a live stream video via Instagram from Instagram account hittafrmupdaway, previously identified as Bryants account, that portrayed Bryant utilizing a cellular device to live stream video of Bryant flashing what appeared to be a barrel of a semi-automatic handgun. Bryant also made comments during the video about the shooting which stated, Dumbass got your little sisters house shot up after that dissn shit. I got to look outside to see how many cops out here. A second live stream video was provided to investigators by Kaniya from Instagram account hittafrmupdaway which stated that twelve (12) stormin the block. mother fuckers stormin this bitch that fast. Investigators noted that a females voice in the live stream video is heard calling the name Bryant and Bryant responds to the female in the video.  Kaniya told investigators that Bryant lives around the corner and was able to show investigators his residence, located at 7566 Buckman Avenue, Salisbury, Maryland 21801 which would explain why Bryant was able to observe police response to Kaniyas residence. Kaniya further advised that Karontez and Bryant used to play basketball together in the neighborhood.   Investigators authored a search and seizure warrant for Bryants residence located at 7566 Buckman Avenue in Salisbury. On July 23, 2023 at approximately 0832 hours [8:32 a.m.], MSP S.T.A.T.E. Team made entry via knock and announce into the residence without incident. Investigators conducted a search of the residence which was met with negative results for the seizure of evidence pertinent to the investigation. Bryant was placed under arrest at the scene and transported to the MSP Salisbury Barrack for processing. All juvenile laws and procedures were followed per MSP policy.   Upon leaving Bryants residence, investigators responded to Kaniyas residence for a follow up interview. Kaniya provided investigators with an Instagram photo from Instagram account hittafrmupdaway. The picture appears to have been taken from inside Bryants bedroom which depicts the Maryland State Police armored vehicle being operated by the MSP S.T.A.T.E. Team upon their arrival to the residence.   Investigators have preserved all social media accounts pertinent to the investigation. Bryant is being charged as an adult for attempted murder and other related charges. Department of Juvenile Services has been notified and made aware of Bryants status. Troopers from the MSP Salisbury Barrack transported Bryant to the Wicomico County Detention Center for processing.   Detailed supplements will be added reference interviews that were conducted. Instagram warrants will be obtained along with Geo-fence warrants.   Case closed by arrest, investigation continuing.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>INITIAL INSTAGRAM EVIDENCE</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Initial Instagram evidence provided by victims:  First Video File Name: RPReplay-Final1690074526: Video Description: 1 minute and 13 second run time which starts out as male voice stating, ewww dam, (pause) dam, (video buffers for a few seconds), thats 12 storming the block, lorr__tez shit got blew up! In the background you can hear a female voice yell, Bryant!. Male voice in the video says, huh? Female voice continues to speak which is undecipherable. Male voice in video responds back to female voice saying, I dont know, Bryant didnt do shit, I just (male voice stops speaking for a couple seconds). Male voice then states. Dam, the mother fucking cops storming that bitch that fast!? Male voice continues saying, What the fuck, Dam! Male voice says, I told niggas to move off my block man! (video continues but breaks up for a few seconds). Male voice states, The cops be around Im go get in the house. Male voice continues, Niggas be talking that shit on the live earlier, what happened? What just happened lorr__tez!? End of video.  Note: During the beginning of the live feed video, it appears to be displaying the side of a blue wall with gray paint markings on the wall and part of a tv. A pop up on the video comes up that captions request to be in this live video with two unidentified accounts trying to view the video. The rest of the video goes black. You can hear the male go outside but the video appears to stay dark. After the conclusion of the residential search warrant, the wall markings in the first video shown by investigators on scene match the same wall markings observed in the search warrant photos of Bryant Thomas Brown- Clarks room appeared to be the same.  Second Video File Name: RpReplay-Final160074677 Video Description: 32 second run time which starts out as a males voice stating, Bitch Nigga, Im spending every fucking day. In the video, you can observe a barrel of what appears to be a handgun which goes in and out of the video briefly. The males voice appears to be stating, That shit aint happen nigga, you were just on the live, your dumbass got your little sister and fucking tossed her house shot up during that dumbass dissin shit, bitch! The male voice continues to say, I just dropped my shit. (You can hear in the background of the video that something dropped, possibly the handgun which was displayed in the video earlier.) Male voice states, Imma go look to see how many more cops are down there. You can hear what sounds like a door opening and the video ends.  Note: During the video, it appears the camera is on the ground facing towards the ceiling. It is assumed this is the angle because you can see a television that is turned on. You can also tell this is a live feed video because other Instagram users are joining the video and it states at the bottom, 16 others joined.  Instagram Image File Name: 3321.jpg Image description: The image displays a still shot from an inside window of a residence. You can observe in the picture it is through a window due to the reflection of the blinds inside the window. You can also observe the Maryland State Police S.T.A.T.E Team black bear cat (armored vehicle) outside a residence. The photo is captioned crazyyyyy across the middle of the photo.  Note: After the residential search warrant, it was observed that this photo was taken from Bryants bedroom during the execution of the residential search warrant by MSP S.T.A.T.E. Team. I know this to be Bryants bedroom due to Bryants parents advising that is Bryants bedroom during the execution of the warrant. The angle from Bryants bedroom also matched with the angle of the image capture and the position of where the bear cat was positioned during the execution of the warrant.  Case remains closed based on arrest. Investigation continues pending investigative supplements to be added. </NarrativeText>

Jarrica identified her husband William Hinman as PJ, however, Jarrica denied that William Hinman could have had anything to do with the shooting on Fentral Avenue.  Jarrica confirmed that she had a juvenile son, approximately ten (10) years of age and agreed to allow me to speak to him concerning the investigation.  Jarricas son, Brenden Hinman, [hereinafter referred to as Brenden] advised that on the night of the shooting he was outside his residence on Brent Avenue letting his dog in the house, when he observed Bryant Brown-Clark [hereinafter referred to as Bryant] walking in the street in front of his residence. It should be noted that Brenden is familiar with Bryant due to his interaction with Bryant in the neighborhood.  Brenden and his sister were home alone when Bryant walked past Brendens residence.  As Bryant walked by he told Brenden to go in the house. Brendan said okay and stated that he was going back inside anyway.  Brenden said it was dark outside when he saw Bryant. He was unable to make out what Bryant was wearing and added that he did not observe him carrying anything in his hands because he was not paying attention.  Brenden said a few minutes later, when he was in the shower, he heard gunshots.  Upon leaving Jarricas residence, I learned that William Hinman is not the PJ that is being implicated in the shooting.  I further learned that PJ resides at 28106 Rockawalkin Ridge Road, Salisbury, Maryland and the rumor that he is involved originated from Bryants mother, Danielle.  Case closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>

Donna Radcliff, #5640 of the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region responded to 28106 Rockawalkin Ridge Road, Salisbury, Maryland 21801 for a follow-up interview to this investigation. Upon arrival, I made contact with Ronald Morgan, Jr. [hereinafter referred to as Ronald]. This interview was audibly and visually recorded utilizing my agency issued body worn camera. Below is synopsis of the interview and not a transcript, therefore some paraphrasing may be used.   Ronald is uncle to the victim, Kaniya Bratten [hereinafter referred to as Kaniya.  Ronalds nickname is PJ.  Ronald was aware that his name had been implicated in the investigation and was told by Kaniya that law enforcement would probably want to speak with him.  Ronald knows Bryant Brown-Clark [hereinafter referred to as Bryant] from the neighborhood.  Ronald advised that on the night of the incident he was at a family gathering and received a call from Kaniya telling him that her house had been shot up. It was not until he talked with Kaniya that he became aware that Bryant hadsomething to do with the shooting.  Ronald denied that Bryant had discussed what he was going to do and further added that Bryant normally confides in Ronald, seeking advice and guidance at times.  Ronald said he tries to be a role model for the younger kids in the neighborhood and that Bryants mom, Danielle, is mad at him because she believes Bryant is Ronalds responsibility.  Ronald was aware that Danielle was spreading rumors that he had something to do with the shooting.  Ronalds mother was present during the interview, Rhonda Salter [hereinafter referred to as Rhonda]. Rhonda said Kaniya is her granddaughter and Danielle is not aware that they are all related.  Rhonda further advised that she was with Ronald at the family gathering the night the incident occurred.  Ronald said Kaniya showed him the video that Bryant uploaded to Instagram and added that he could visibly see the barrel of a gun in the video.  Ronald was cooperative and agreed to speak with me further in the future if needed.  Case closed by arrest</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>BRYANT'S INSTAGRAM RECORDS SUPPLEMENT</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>BRYANTS-INSTAGRAM RESPONSE   On September 5, 2023, Instagram responded to the search warrant served. Instagram provided records from Instagram usernames hittafrmupdaway [Bryant Brown-Clarks account] and lorr__tez[ Karontez Bratten account]. The following information obtained in documented below:  Account Identifier: hittafrmupdaway Account Type: Instagram User Registered Email Address: bbclark06gmail.com Registration Date: 2019-01-28 16:29:08 UTC Account Status: Active Phone Numbers: +14437358028   I, S/TPR Mingos, conducted a review of these records. I observed a conversation between Bryant and Karontez including listed audio call which started earlier in the day before the shooting on July 22nd, 2023 at 22:09:42 UTC [ 6:09 PM Eastern Standard Time]. The first contact between the individuals was started by Bryant stating, yhu out rock? Bryant then started a 40 second audio call with Karontez. Korontez then started a 16 second audio call with Bryant. Bryant responds in text to Karontez, bluffin ass young nigga. Karontez starts another video chat with Bryant which lasts for 77 seconds. The conversation then ends.   Bryants linked_media folder contained 655 items containing videos, audio messages, and pictures. Several pictures are observed of Bryant which is another factor of this account being his. The following items below are items that were flagged as evidentiary value pertaining to this case:    File path: Instagram\hittafrmupdaway\ 2942008322601531\linked_media\ unified_message_159839890418906.jpg\ unified_message_573811718248825 \ unified_message_640329404328777  Description: These are three (3) different pictures of Bryant posing with hands together demonstrating of holding a handgun and pointing it at the camera.

File path: Instagram\hittafrmupdaway\ 2942008322601531\linked_media\ unified_message_773648914502139  Description: This is a 10 second runtime video recorded on Social Media Platform TikTok and was captured by Instagram username identified as sylviaalorenn_. The video starts out showing juvenile females face and at 5 seconds, the video angle changes to Bryant [who is sitting on a bed with a green NIKE bag hanging around his neck]. Bryant pulls out a black handled handgun with a silver slide. Bryant then appears to point the barrel of the handgun at the camera. The video then ends.  On June 28th, 2023 at 22:36:55 UTC, Bryant Instagram messages user sylviaalorenn_ and states, Send me the video we made on tictok. On June 28, 2023 at 22:53:42 UTC, sylviaalorenn_ sends the video to Bryant.    File path: Instagram\hittafrmupdaway\ 2942008322601531\linked_media\ unified_message_981360316390728  Description: This is a picture which appears to be a self-produced picture of Bryant. In the picture you can observe a subject from the chest down to the floor, and the wall across from the subject. The subject is wearing a black zipped up jacket and blue jeans. In the right pocket of the blue jean appears to be the same handgun that was observed in item 3, listed above. You can observe a black handled handgun with a silver slide in the right jean pants pocket. I can conclude that the picture location in located on the back porch of Bryants residence. I can recognize the screen tent along with the red furniture that was also observed during the residential search warrant photos [refer to search warrant photographs for comparison attached with original agency case file].

File path: Instagram\hittafrmupdaway\ 2942008322601531\linked_media\ unified_message_1448509822648081    margin-left:48px; padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in"&gt;Description: This image is a screenshot of a text conversation with a picture displaying Bryant with his hands up pointing his fingers as if he is holding a handgun at the camera. The picture is captioned, Hit him up Fr he need a female. In the picture you can observe it is Bryant.   After completing the review of the records, there was nothing documented by Instagram that was recorded live stream. The phone conversations between Bryant and Karontez on the day of the shooting are not categorized or logged by Instagram per specific conversation. The only actual videos of the live stream were the videos and picture evidence obtained by the victim/witnesses. Those videos along with the Instagram evidence against Bryant are attached to the original case file.   There were five audio conversations files that I flagged from Bryants Instagram account that may be relevant to this investigation. The audio files are listed below:    File path: Instagram\hittafrmupdaway\ 2942008322601531\linked_media\unified_message_739183321545469  Description: This is a 14 seconds run time audio clip of Bryant saying, If I find out your fucking on another nigger..
