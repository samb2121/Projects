On September 7, 2023, at approximately 0450 hours, members of the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit (MSP CCU) of the Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce, and the MSP Leonardtown Barrack executed a residential search and seizure warrant at 24862 Three Notch Road, Hollywood, Maryland 20636, for evidence relating to child pornography violations. No force was used to make entry into the residence. Three individuals were located inside of the residence, Ellis Eugene Tolbert Jr. (W/M, DOB: 9/29/1958), Mary Ellen Tolbert (W/F, DOB: 10/10/1961), and Ellis Eugene Tolbert 3rd (W/M, DOB: 6/5/1982).     The forthcoming interview was recorded on a departmentally issued Sony IC Recorder. The following interview is not a complete and exact transaction, but mere synopsis. For a clearer and more concise dissertation of the interview, refer to the recording in the case file.   At approximately 0503 hours, TFC Burnett and TFC Crowe interviewed Ellis Tolbert Jr. Sonny in an unmarked State Police vehicle, in the driveway of the residence. Sonny was advised of his Miranda Rights which he free and voluntarily waived and indicated by signing the Advice of Miranda Rights (Form 180). Sonny provided some contact information, (240-572-5345,  text-decoration:underline"&gt;sonnytolbert42@gmail.com).  During the interview, Sonny explained that he had the email (scrooded11@gmail.com) and used it to look at pornography, and it was cut off a couple of months ago because he was looking at child pornography. But the other email ( text-decoration:underline"&gt;scrooged133@gmail.com) he still utilizes for pornography. Sonny explained in 2018, child pornography would pop up on his phone when he was looking at nude beaches and that was how he became curious about child pornography. Sonny advised he had about 3 or 4 pictures of child pornography. Then he said he had a lot (about 30) files of child pornography years ago and got rid of them about a month ago. Sonny then advised he masturbated to child pornography about a week or so ago.  Sonny advised he has Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram accounts which he could not provide the usernames at this time. Sonny only said that he had child pornography on his phone, not in any other account.  At approximately 0549 hours, we interviewed Mary Tolbert in the same unmarked State Police vehicle, in the driveway of the residence. During the conversation, Mary advised she did not know who would have child pornography in the house. But she believed it to be Ellis Tolbert Jr. over Ellis Tolbert 3rd. Mary advised they have a granddaughter who is 7 months old and a step-grandson who is 19 years old. She also said she has about 17 nieces/nephews. Mary explained that none of them really come over to the house. Mary provided her password to her phone and nothing was found within in it.  At approximately 0600 hours, we interviewed Ellis Eugene Tolbert 3rd in the same unmarked State Police vehicle, in the driveway of the residence. Ellis advised that he did not know who would have child pornography within the house. Ellis provided his passwords to his devices and nothing was found within in them.  During the interview, investigators searched the residence for any electronic devices of interest. Cpl. Fitzgerald conducted an on-scene preview of a couple devices and observed child pornography. The above listed items were seized for a further forensic examination.  Sonny agreed to take a polygraph examination for any hands-on offenses with minors. Sonny drove himself to the MSP Prince Frederick Barrack, where Sgt. Farfan conducted a polygraph examination. Sonny later passed with no deception to sexual contact with children.  After consultation with St. Marys County Assistant States Attorney Sowls, it was determined that Ellis Tolbert Jr. will be charged at a later date, once the full forensic extraction of the devices is completed.  The devices were transported to the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit temporary storage and held on a Chain of Custody (Form 67) and Property Record (P-344637).    On 9/11/2023, I submitted a lab request for the forensic examination of the devices that were seized.  On 9/12/2023, the Honorable Judge Chesser signed the Maryland State Police residence, body and vehicle Search Warrant Inventory Report and Return (Form 98) and the Maryland State Police residence, body and vehicle Evidence Inventory (Form 98A). The Post Search Warrant Survey (Form 40) was completed.  OPEN, PENDING FORENSICS</NarrativeText>
