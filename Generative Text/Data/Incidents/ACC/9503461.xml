         <NarrativeText>This Incident was recorded, H-25 equipped with in car camera system, body worn camera in use.  Narrative:  On February 15, 2023 at approximately 2200 hours, I responded to a hit-and-run collision in the area of northbound Indian head Highway at the intersection of Marshall Hall Rd., Indian Head Charles County Maryland. Preliminary investigation revealed a white Chevrolet Suburban bearing Maryland registration 2EX2456 was attempting to make a left turn onto Marshall Hall rd. from northbound Indian Head Highway when it struck a red Mack truck bearing New Jersey registration AU695V that was attempting to make a left turn onto Livingston road from southbound Indian Head Highway. The Suburban then fled the scene and was later located in the Country Place Liquor Store parking lot, located at 3140 Marshall Hall Rd., by Charles County Deputies who were canvasing the area. There was also an indentation that was dug into the pavement from the broken axle that started from the scene of the collision and lead to where the Suburban came to rest. The Suburban was unoccupied and all car doors locked.  I arrived on scene and observed the that the front right axle of the Suburban was snapped by the force of the collision and that the damage on the Suburban matches the damage to the Mack truck. A METERS/NCIC query on the registration of the Suburban revealed the registered owner, identified by his name and DOB as Johnson, Michael Alphanso, African American Male, DOB: 09/21/1979 and an address of 2951 Bannock St. Bryan Road.   At approximately 2209 hours, I responded to 2951 Bannock St. to attempt to make contact with Johnson. After knocking on the front door several times, an African American Female answered and identified herself as Johnsons wife. I asked her if Johnson was home, and shes stated that Johnson was home and was sleeping. I asked her if Johnson was involved in an accident today while driving the Suburban bearing Maryland registration 2EX2456 and she stated, yes, I went there to pick him up. I asked him if he was driving, and she nodded her head yes. I asked her to go and awake Johnson, so I could ask him what happened during the collision. Johnsons wife first told me she did not want to awake him but after asking twice she closed the door and went to go wake Johnson.  Johnson opened the door and was extremely irate. Johnson closed and locked the glass screen door of his residence. He would scream towards us and would bang his hand on the glass panel. While talking to Johnson, I observed his eyes were bloodshot and glassy and his speech was extremely slurred. I could also detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating through the screen door while talking to Johnson. While talking to Johnson I asked him for his license, registration, and proof of insurance for the Chevrolet Suburban. Johnson refused to identify himself and refused to show any proof of insurance for his vehicle. I asked Johnson why didnt he stay on scene and call the police when the collision occurred, and he stated he wasnt in a collision then stated the vehicle hit me, and he didnt stay then stated Im not giving you guys shit why do I have to do? On over five different occasions, I had to explain to Johnson that he has to remain on scene and exchange insurance information to the other party involved.  Johnson refused to identify himself and refused to show any type of insurance for the Chevrolet. I ordered Johnson to identify himself and he refused. Due to Johnsons argumentative and uncooperative actions, I was unable to complete my investigation of the collision. Johnson stated to, Come back with a warrant, and well settle it in court.  By using a NCIC/METERS query on the Suburban I was able to acquire an MVA photo of the registered owner. Using the MVA photo I was able to determine that Johnson was infarct he registered owner of the suburban.  On 2/23/2023 I applied for a criminal summons at the Charles County District Court Commissioners office. Johnson was charged with the following:    1-0043 Obstructing and Hindering    TA 20 103A Failure to stop after an accident involving damage to an attended vehicle    TA 20 103 B Failure to remain at the scene of an accident involving an attended vehicle.    TA 20 105.1 Failure of driver involved in an accident to give insurance information    TA 21 901.1 A Reckless Driving    TA 21 901.1 B Negligent Driving    TA 13 409 B Failure to display registration card on demand    TA 16 122 C Failure of individual driving on highway to display license to uniformed officer upon demand.   On 4/12/2023, Sgt. Norman served the criminal summons on Johnson.  All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland.  Case Closed.</NarrativeText>
