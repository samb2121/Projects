         <NarrativeText>INCIDENT:  Vehicle Pursuit  LOCATION:   Eastbound 40 @ Delancy Road  SUSPECT: Antonio Estrada Sanchez (H/M DOB: 05/07/1942)  VEHICLE:   Silver Toyota Camry   Delaware registration 240621  SCENE PROCESSING:   Not applicable  NARRATIVE:  On Friday, March 17, 2023, at approximately 2123 hours, I TFC. Rogers #7224, was on duty, in my marked Maryland State Police Ford Explorer F-21. I was parked in a parking lot, approximately 20 feet off the roadway at 800 East Pulaski Hwy Elkton, Maryland 21921. While parked perpendicular to the roadway in order to observe traffic on Pulaski Highway, I observed a Silver Sedan traveling eastbound on US 40 in lane 2. The vehicle failed to maintain the lane it was traveling in and drifted onto the right shoulder. The vehicle appeared as if it was going to crash into my marked Maryland State Police vehicle, before abruptly correcting its direction of travel, and drifting into lane 2. Due to the erratic driving behavior observed and for the safety of the other motorists on the road, I immediately pulled out from the parking lot in order to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle.  After pulling onto eastbound Pulaski Highway, I activated my emergency lights and sirens to initiate a traffic stop. When I activated my emergency lights and sirens, it appeared as if the vehicle was pulling over to the left shoulder. I then observed the vehicle fail to remain in lane 1, traveling into the grass median, where it continued at the same speed, while striking a traffic sign. After striking the traffic sign, the vehicle continued driving in the grass median. The vehicle traveled in the grass median for approximately 350 feet before merging back onto the roadway. Believing that this vehicle was being operated by an impaired driver, I notified the North East Barrack of the vehicle driving in the median and the striking of a road sign. Corporal Kim 6166, the shift commander, authorized the pursuit of the vehicle. The vehicle continued traveling eastbound on Pulaski Highway where the driver failed to maintain a single lane, utilizing the shoulder and all travel lanes. At the intersection of Pulaski Highway and Automotive Boulevard, I observed the vehicle to be a Toyota sedan displaying Delaware registration 240621. I continued to pursue the vehicle with my lights and sirens until the pursuit was terminated by Corporal Kim at the Delaware state line. After being advised to terminate the pursuit, I immediately turned off my emergency lights and sirens and utilized the next immediate crossover. The pursuit, from when the vehicle entered the grass median to where the pursuit was terminated was approximately one minute and thirty-one seconds. The distance from the location of where the vehicle initially entered the grass median, to the Delaware state line is approximately a half mile. The speed of the suspects vehicle during the pursuit would fluctuate from 20-40 miles per hour. Traffic conditions were light, the roadway was dry, and there were no traffic hazards that would interfere or create a safety risk. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.  After returning to Maryland, I was advised by Corporal Kim, the vehicle had crashed near 2748 Pulaski Highway Newark, Delaware 19702. Kim stated Delaware State Police was out with the vehicle and the driver, identified as Antonio Estrada Sanchez (H/M DOB: 05/07/1942). Upon my arrival on scene, I was able to observe Sanchez as the only person in the vehicle. I was also able to confirm the vehicle to be the same vehicle that fled. I made contact with Delaware State Police who stated the vehicle ran off the road and into the grass median, where it struck an electric pole. Sanchez was transported to Christiana Hospital with unknown injuries. After arriving at the hospital, Corporal Harrison, of the Delaware State Police, contacted me and advised Sanchez had a blood sugar of 47 mg/dL. Corporal Harrison stated Doctors advised this accident could have stemmed from a medical emergency along with other possible factors.   After speaking with Corporal Harrison, of the Delaware State Police, it was found this incident stemmed from an emergency medical issue. After consulting with Cecil Countys Assistant States Attorney Nicole Kelly, it was determined charges would not be filed against Sanchez.     I request this case closed due to this being a medical emergency.    All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.      </NarrativeText>
