         <NarrativeText>  On April 5, 2023, I, Trooper Rowe (#7015), responded to US Route 1 and Poole Road for the report of an accident that involved an active domestic assault and additional parties actively fighting. Once I arrived on scene, I made contact with fire and EMS personnel. They advised me that the male subject laying on the shoulder was the pedestrian that was struck and that he was going to be flown to shock trauma. I made contact with one of the witnesses on scene, who I identified as Ryan Elkinton Meade by his Pennsylvania drivers license. Meade advised he was behind the vehicle that struck the pedestrian, which he identified as the white Dodge truck in front of his vehicle. Meade advised he observed two vehicles in front of the white Dodge truck swerve to avoid something in the roadway. Meade advised he assumed it was some normal debris in the roadway and did not think anything of it as the white Dodge truck did not swerve to avoid it. Meade observed the white Dodge truck swerve hard left as if to avoid the debris last second, but the pedestrian then appeared coming from under the white truck. Meade advised he saw a woman from a white Jeep that was on the shoulder at the time, exit her vehicle and begin berating the driver of the white Dodge truck. I got Meades contact information and released him from the scene as he advised he had to leave.   I contacted the driver of the white Dodge truck, who I identified as Stephen Michael Hayes Sr by his Maryland drivers license. Hayes advised he was driving northbound on US Route 1 when he observed a man walking in the northbound lane of US Route 1 a few cars ahead of him. Hayes advised the two cars in front of him came to a complete stop as they could not get around the man walking in the lane. When there was no oncoming traffic in the southbound lane, the two cars in front of Hayes went around the man. Hayes honked his horn at the man in the roadway. The man proceeded to berate Hayes and jumped onto the front of his truck. Hayes advised the man was hitting the hood of his truck with the mans fists. Hayes was able to point out two dents on his hood, but could not confirm the dents originated from this incident. Hayes stated he attempted to get away from the man to avoid confrontation. Hayes turned his steering wheel to the left and began to drive away. Hayes stated the man then fell off his hood and went under his truck. Hayes continued to move away from the man, but did pull over to the shoulder.   I then contacted the woman from the white Jeep, who I identified as Kari Nicole Queen by her Maryland drivers license. Queen advised the pedestrian who was struck was her boyfriend. Queen identified the pedestrian as Christopher Allan Milburn. Queen stated Milburn had just gotten off of work and did not have a ride home. Queen was busy with something, so Milburn decided to walk to his residence in Darlington.Queen advised once she became available she started to Milburns location to pick him up and take him home. When Queen arrived in the area, she advised she passed him while he was walking on the shoulder. Queen pulled off to the shoulder in front of Milburn, so he could get in. At that time, Queen advised she watched as the white Dodge truck honked at Milburn through her rear view mirror. Milburn was seen throwing his hands up and yelling at Hayes. Queen advised she observed Hayes swerve his vehicle onto the should to strike Milburn. Queen advised Hayes show no intention of stopping, so she began to follow Hayes truck to obtain Hayes license plate number. Once Queen began following, Hayes pulled over to the shoulder and Queen then went to check on Milburn.   I was unable to make contact with Milburn. He was unable to explain what happened due to his injuries. A witness statement was filled out by Hayes and Queen. Another witness filled out a witness statement, but they arrived after Milburn was struck and provided no additional evidence.   Senior Trooper Orem (#5656), a trooper from Criminal Enforcement, responded to the scene and interviewed the parties involved.  During the incident, I detected a strong odor of marijuana emanating from Queens vehicle. I know the odor of marijuana due to my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. Once Queen was released by ST Orem, I conducted a probable cause search on her vehicle. I located a metal grinder containing marijuana in the front passenger side door. I also located four vacuumed sealed bags containing four smaller vacuumed sealed baggies containing marijuana in a book bag in the trunk. Each of the smaller baggies were labeled 1 OZ and Sherblato. I located two additional smaller vacuumed sealed baggies containing marijuana in the book bag, also labeled Sherblato but these were labeled 1/2 OZ. Another one of the smaller vacuumed sealed baggies containing marijuana were located in the book bag, but this one was already opened and stored inside a clear plastic baggie. I know this substance to be marijuana due to my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. The marijuana was seized at approximately 1819 hours. Queen was issued a criminal citation for possession of CDS marijuana exceeding civil amount and released from the scene. The marijuana was transported to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack, processed properly on Property Held #334659, and found to have a total weight of 468.9 grams. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. I request this case be forwarded to CED for further investigation. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText> On April 5, 2023, I was requested to assist with a possible vehicular assault investigation in the area of 3634 Conowingo Rd, Street, Harford County, MD. I was instructed to respond to the scene to conduct interviews. Upon my arrival, I made contact with initial responding Troopers who pointed out the driver of the involved truck as well as the girlfriend of the involved subject that had been flown to Shock Trauma. They briefed me on the situation and advised that both of these parties provided conflicting accounts of what had occurred. I would then conduct recorded interviews with both subjects separately in my vehicle at the scene. I also conducted an additional recorded interview over the phone with a witness that advised she left as she felt it was not safe to remain at the scene. The following is a synopsis of each interview. Please refer to the recordings for each interview in their entirety.  Interview with Kari Queen Queen, Kari Nicole (W/F DOB 02/25/1987) 2721 Conowingo Rd Apt. A, Bel Air, MD 21015 (443) 750-0218   The first interview I conducted was with Ms. Queen. She advised she had met her boyfriend, Christopher Milburn at the Wawa during his break around 1300-1330 hours. She then had to leave to go babysit and Milburn advised he would get a ride back to work. Around 1504 hours, Milburn texted her to ask if she was off yet and she said no, but she finished babysitting soon after and went to pick him up. She knew the route he would walk home and drove in that direction. Once she saw him, she drove past him and stopped on the shoulder for him to catch up. At that time, she advised Christopher was dead center in the shoulder of the road when traffic became backed up for some reason. A white Dodge Ram then started honking his horn at Milburn and Christopher turned around, threw his arms in the air and yelled What the fuck do you want me to do, Im walking in the fucking shoulder. Queen then alleged that for no other reason, the driver of the truck swerved into the shoulder, knocked Milburn down, ran over his ankles and began to drive off. After seeing this, she was going to walk to Christopher but thought the truck was not going to stop so she got back in her car grabbed her phone and held it as if to record him and began driving after the truck which stopped several feet up the road. After taking a picture of the tag, Queen reversed her vehicle back to Christopher.   Queen admitted that she saw the entire incident from several feet ahead through her rearview mirror and that she could see him (Milburn) but could not see the bottom half of him contrary to her statement that she knew he was on the shoulder the entire time. She also advised that the truck driver intentionally swerved to strike Milburn, but later said she did not know if the driver was purposely trying to knock him down or hit him, but was trying to at least scare him. She stated she had never seen the driver of the Ram prior to this encounter and did not know of any reason that it would have occurred. I asked if Milburn said anything after being struck and she stated he was just screaming in pain about his ankles. Queen had nothing additional to add at the time.  Interview with Wendy Hanks Wendy Lynne Pool Hanks (443) 752-0246   After speaking to Queen, I was informed that an additional witness had called the barrack to report what she saw. Her information was listed on the incident card and I called her from the scene. Prior to recording the interview, I called her and asked if it would be okay if I recorded our conversation and she gave me her consent to do so.   The subject identified herself as Wendy Lynne Pool Hanks. She advised she was traveling northbound on route one when she observed a white SUV driving slowly on the right shoulder and a male walking next to the SUV in the travel portion of the roadway. As she got closer, she advised traffic ahead of her abruptly stopped as they were unable to proceed because of on coming traffic on the opposite side of the road, and unable to drive around the subject walking in the travel portion. As opposing traffic cleared, several vehicles were able to go around the subject, and Ms. Hanks did the same. She advised she observed a white Ram truck behind her who honked his horn at the subject walking in the road. AT that time, the operator of the white truck would not have been able to drive around the pedestrian due to on coming traffic and was driving very slowly. After the driver honked, the pedestrian went bananas and started cursing and shouting the F bomb. The pedestrian then started beating and hitting the truck so the operator swerved to the left at which time Ms. Hanks saw the pedestrian fall to the ground. She then observed a female exit the white SUV while yelling curse words and then kicked the side of the truck. Ms. Hansk advised she did not know any of the parties involved, but it appeared as though the pedestrian and driver of the SUV definitely knew each other. Ms. Hanks reiterated that the pedestrian was definitely standing in the travel portion of the road and the truck slowly tried to swerve around the pedestrian. Ms. Hanks then apologized for not staying at the scene, but admitted that she was very scared due to the circumstances.   Ms. Hanks had nothing additional to add at the time.  Interview with Stephen Hayes Stephen Michael Hayes Sr (DOB September 16, 1955) 4109136675 135 n main st port deposit md   According to Hayes, he was traveling northbound on US Rt. 1 in the area of Poole Rd at approximately 1530 hours. At that time, traffic suddenly slowed to a near stop and he saw a white SUV on the shoulder approximately two to three cars ahead and he then saw a male outside of the vehicle screaming obscenities. Hayes made it clear that he was not certain if the male was associated with the white SUV but reiterated multiple times that based on the subjects demeanor, he was unsure if the subject had just robbed or carjacked someone and had no idea what was going on. He went on to advise that the male subject was standing approximately three quarters of the way in the travel portion of the north bound lane. Due to vehicles approaching from the opposite lane and the subject in the road, northbound vehicles were unable to continue through until traffic in the opposing lane cleared. At some point, the two vehicles ahead of Hayes were able to get through. As Hayes got closer, he honked his horn which caused the pedestrian to spin toward him and Hayes stated the pedestrian shouted something along the lines of Ill fucking (not sure if he said kill or get) you. The pedestrian then attempted to jump on to the front right-side hood of Hayes Truck and started banging on the hood. Not knowing exactly what had already occurred and observing the pedestrians behavior, Hayes attempted to leave the situation turning his wheels to the left thinking the subject would slide off the hood and he then began driving away. As he did, the pedestrian slid off, but Hayes felt a boom, boom indicating he had obviously run something over. Hayes then continued forward until he was a safe distance away and stopped to call 911. As he stopped, he advised the female operator of the white SUV got out of her vehicle approached him and began yelling obscenities and kicking the side of his truck.   After initial arriving Troopers arrived on scene, they pointed out some dents on Hayes hood which he advised were not there prior to this incident. Additionally, Hayes pointed out what could have been a shoe mark on the passenger door of his truck.   After conducting these interviews, I passed the information along to Tfc. Pope who took the lead on this investigation. Due to the circumstances, it was determined that no charges would be filed at that time pending further investigation.  </NarrativeText>
