         <NarrativeText>DUI Case Number: 23-031 / 23MSP006430  Drivers License: (MD) B-260-765-067-878  Subsequent Offender: Yes (Out of State: DC)  Intoximeter results: .17 BrAC   This traffic stop was recorded on body worn camera (Tpr. Gardner #7503, and TFC Kreczmer #6916) and in car camera (H-15).   Certifications and training:  Certified in the administration of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.   Vehicle in motion:    On February 19, 2023 at approximately 0209 hours I, Trooper Gardner #7503, was operating marked MSP patrol vehicle H-15 in the area of Crain Highway and Acton Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland. I observed a black Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration 6EZ2718 driving northbound on Crain Highway south of Acton Lane in Lane 2 with no taillights or headlights activated. The vehicle made a U-turn at Crain Highway and Acton Lane and began traveling southbound on Crain Highway. I activated my emergency equipment and stopped the vehicle at Crain Highway and Business Park Drive, Waldorf.   Personal Contact:   Upon initial contact with the driver, I observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy and detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. I asked her where she was coming from and if she had consumed any alcoholic beverages, and she stated that she had one shot of an unknown drink at a local lounge called society in Waldorf. I identified the driver as Shermika Andrea Booker (AA/F DOB: 11/16/1979) by her Maryland drivers license and requested an additional unit for Standardized Field Sobriety Testing.   Pre- Arrest Screening   Booker agreed to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. The tests were conducted on the right turn lane of Crain Highway north of Business Park Drive. The roadway was dry, level, and clear of debris. The area was illuminated by headlights and flashlights. The front emergency equipment was de-activated on all patrol vehicles. Ofc. Baxley #708, Ofc. Bottwof #575, from the Charles County Sheriffs Office, and TFC Krezcmer #6916 arrived on scene to assist.    While walking to the front of Bookers vehicle, Booker had difficulty maintaining her balance and nearly fell into traffic. I had lane 3 blocked as a precaution to conduct SFTs safely due to Bookers lack of balance. I noticed that Booker swayed while walking to the front of the car. I asked Booker if she had any injuries, or was on any medications that would prevent her from testing, Booker stated no. I asked Booker if she wore glasses or contacts and she stated no. I explained and demonstrated each of the tests, and Booker states that she understood the instructions. Booker was wearing a tan dress and a leopard fur jacket with black boots during testing.   Test One  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus  Bookers eyes were blood shot and glassy. Her pupils were normal sized and she displayed equal tracking. Booker had difficulty following the stimulus with her eyes and had to be reminded not to move her head. Booker displayed vertical gaze nystagmus in both eyes.   1. Booker displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  2. Booker displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  3. Booker displayed nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  Total Clues: 6 of 6   Test Two: Walk and Turn   Booker had to be instructed multiple times to get back into the instructional position.   1. Booker broke heel to toe contact and failed to maintain balance during the instructional portion of the test.  2. Booker attempted to begin the test before being instructed to start 3. Booker broke heel to toe contact on all steps in both series of nine steps.  4. Booker attempted to stop the test on step 3 in the first series of nine steps.  5. Booker took 12 steps in the first series of nine steps and 11 steps in the second series of nine steps.  6. Booker stepped off line on all steps in both series of nine steps.  7. Booker turned improperly and failed to keep her lead foot planted while turning  Total Clues: 7 of 8   Test Three  One Leg Stand  Booker started counting after five seconds while conducting the test. Booker counted one two three hold on and stopped counting during the remainder of the test. Booker was unable to keep her foot up for more than five seconds.   1. Booker placed her foot down seven times during testing.  2. Booker used her arms for balance during the test.  3. Booker swayed side to side during the entire test  4. Booker hopped while attempting to maintain balance during the test.  Total Clues: 4 of 4   Additional Processing:  Booker was offered a preliminary breath test after the completion of SFSTs and agreed to submit to a PBT. Booker made multiple attempts to breath in instead of blowing out into the PBT, and failed to blow hard enough to register a sufficient breath sample. Booker failed to produce a sufficient sample for the test. After the completion of Standardized Field Sobriety testing I informed Booker that she was under arrest for DUI. Booker was played a virtual copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website, and she agreed to submit to the intoximeter test. Booker was transported to the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack and submitted to the test. Booker had to be reminded multiple times to blow into the machine instead of breathing in, and to blow harder into the machine during the test. A sufficient sample was received at 0342 hours by Cpl Casarella #5627. The result of the intoximeter was .17 BrAC. Booker was issued 6 citations and released to a sober driver at the barrack.   All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland.   Case Closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
