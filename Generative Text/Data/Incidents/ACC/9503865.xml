         <NarrativeText>DWI # 23-063  R-43 is equipped with a mobile video recording device and I had my Axon body camera throughout the incident. This incident was both audibly and visually recorded.  Defendant:Wagner Baptiste  Date of Birth:05/03/1985  Date of Arrest:01/28/2023  Time of Arrest: 0240 hours  PA DL: 28349671  Training Certifications: -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police. -NHSTA certified to conduct field sobriety test (SFST). -Preliminary breath test operator certified.  Narrative:  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On January 28th, 2023 at approximately 0205 hours, I Trooper Lowery #7448, was dispatched to a single vehicle collision on 83 North prior to Northern Parkway. Upon arrival I saw a silver Volkswagen PA: LPA5100, in lane 1, with heavy front end damage.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  I approached the vehicle from the passengers side and saw an individual sitting in the back seat. The individual was identified as Wagner Baptiste, later identified by his PA drivers license. I opened the door to speak to Baptiste and immediately smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I asked Baptiste to step out of the vehicle to speak with me. Baptiste began crying and was speaking to someone on his cell phone. As I separated Baptiste from the vehicle I could immediately smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his person. I asked Baptiste to tell me what happened that caused the collision. Baptiste could not answer my question and began crying. I asked Baptiste how much alcohol he had to drink tonight. Baptiste advised he had a cup of Hennessey. Baptiste continued to speak to someone on his cell phone, and I asked Baptiste to hang up the phone and put it inside his pocket. The individual on the other line stated for Baptiste to not hang up his cell phone, but instead place it inside his pocket it with them still on the line.  I asked the following preliminary SFSTS questions to Baptiste.  Injuries- None. Medication Use- None. Diabetic- No. Highest level of education- Associates degree. Glasses- No. Alcohol- Yes, a cup of Hennessey.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  The surface was wet, flatand free from debris. Temperatures were in the mid 30s Prior to administering standardized field sobriety tests, I had Baptiste face me, away from any other lights or vehicles.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Baptistes eyes. Baptistewas instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes, not moving his head, until told to stop. Baptistes pupils were equal in size, had no resting nystagmus and showed equal tracking.  1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes. 2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes. 3) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes. Vertical Nystagmus- Not present.   WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed)  Prior to Baptisteperforming the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Baptiste was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot with heel to toe touching. Baptiste was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin the test. Baptiste was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Baptistewas instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keeping his eyes focused on his feet and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, I explained and demonstrated to Baptiste to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. I again explained and demonstrated to Baptiste the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Baptiste was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping his hands down by his sides, looking down at his feet, and counting aloud each step. I asked Baptiste if he understood the test and he stated Yes.For demonstration purposes, I only demonstrated three (3) steps in each direction, with a satisfactory example of the turn.  A Solid yellow line separating the right shoulder and lane 1 was used for the Walk and Turn test.  INSTRUCTIONAL STAGE:  1) Baptiste did not maintain the starting position. Baptiste put both his feet together and waited for the instructions to be completed.  WALKING STAGE (1st Nine):  2)Baptiste took 13 steps, instead of the instructed 9. 3) Baptiste missed every step in excess of  inch all the way to step 13. 4) Baptiste stepped off line every step all the way to step 13. 5) Baptiste used his arms for balance on very step all the way to step 13. 6) Baptiste did not create a proper turn. Baptiste stopped at step 13, kept his lead foot planted and spun with both his feet towards his right and stopped walking. 7)Baptiste stopped the test at step 13.   WALKING STAGE (2nd Nine):  Baptiste did not complete the second portion of the Walk and Turn test.  ONE LEG STAND (4/4) clues observed:  Prior to Baptiste performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Baptiste was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was instructed to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Baptiste was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.  Baptiste utilized his right leg for the One Leg Stand test.  1) Puts foot down  Twice between the 0-20 second mark. 2) Sways- Multiple times during 0-20 second mark. 3) Uses arm for balance- Twice during 0-20 second mark. 4) Hops- Multiple times during 0-20 second mark.  During the 0-10 second mark, Baptiste lost his balance and almost fell to the ground to his right.  ARREST:  Based on my training, knowledge and experience, and the following observations: the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Baptistes person;his demeanor beingconsistent with someone under the influence of alcohol, Baptiste being at fault for the single vehicle collision, admission of drinking an alcoholic beverage prior to driving, as well as hispoor performance of SFST;I determined that he would in fact be a driver under the influence of alcohol, and was placed under arrest at 0240 hours on January 28th, 2023.  I placed Baptiste in the front passenger seat of my police vehicle. During transport to Maryland State Police Golden Ring barrack R. During transport Baptiste advised his hands were freezing and he wanted them placed in front of him so he could warm them up. I stopped my vehicle, got out to the passenger side, and placed Baptistes handcuffs in front of him so he could warm up his hands. During transport I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Baptistes person.  On January 28th, 2023 at approximately 0305 hours the DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to Baptiste in English. On January 28th, 2023 at 0317 hours, Baptiste signed he would submit to an alcohol concentration test on the DR-15 Advice of Rights.  On January 28th, 2023 at 0351 Baptiste provided a breath specimen that contained an alcohol concentration of .19 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  Baptiste was then issued appropriate citations for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and traffic citations and was released to his mother.  I request this case to be closed by arrest.  All above events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
