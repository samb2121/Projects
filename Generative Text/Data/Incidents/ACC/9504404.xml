         <NarrativeText>September 19, 2023  The Event Data Recorder for the Honda was imaged at the Glen Burnie Barrack. The EDR analysis is attached as a PDF.  The scene was mapped with a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. A notice to Airman was established BWI 09-137. The mapping was completed using MSP Crash 5 an Autel Evo 2. The mission was completed with one (1) flight fro eight (8) minutes. 136 color photographs were taken. The photographs were processed in the Pix4d application to produce an orthomosic image. The orthomosic image was used to create a diagram in the Map360 software. The orthomosic image was an accurate representation of the scene on September 19, 2023.

         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report  (For review by the MSPCrash Team)  Section I. - Introduction: On 09/18/2023, at approximately 1317 hours, Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack personnel responded to a single vehicle collision on northbound MD-295 south of I-895, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Due to the nature of the collision, a request was made for a collision reconstructionist. I, TFC Bunger # 6459, currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack, responded to the scene.  The investigation will address the issues related to the involved operators and conditions at the time of the collision that may have caused or contributed to the collision. These issues will be addressed in this report by various investigative sources. Conclusions are based upon my investigative actions completed on scene, review of statements and interviews completed by the assigned investigator and other follow up investigative actions. My rendering of these conclusions are based upon my training and experience.     Section II. - Scene Description: (The following descriptions are based on the area where the collision occurred.)  Primary Roadway:Northbound MD-295 at I-895 was a three lane divided highway with a partially paved left shoulder and paved right shoulder. The lanes were separated from the left shoulder by a solid yellow line and from the paved right shoulder by a solid white line. A grass median with trees and shrubbery separated the north and southbound lanes. The posted speed limit on MD-295 was 55 mph.  Environmental Conditions:The collision occurred at approximately 1317 hours. Lighting consisted of overcast daylight. Temperature was approximately 72 degrees Fahrenheit. The weather was overcast with intermittent rain in the morning, the road and median were not wet at the time of the collision.  Section III. - Scene Evidence:  Approximately 120 ft of pressed down grass and shrubs was observed in the center median leading to the vehicle. No furrowing was observed in the median and no tire marks were observed in the travel portion of the highway.  Section IV. - Vehicle(s) Involved:  Vehicle #1:2014 Honda Odyssey MD 49454CF VIN5FNRL5H67EB113988  The Honda had heavy damage to the front bumper, hood, engine, front left quarter panel, and windshield from the collision with a tree in the center median. The front left tire was off the rim. The steering column, knee bolster, and side curtain airbags had deployed. The drivers seat belt was loose and dangling from the b-pillar (the ECM revealed that the seatbelt was not engaged).   Section V. - Person(s) Involved:  Person #1:Gary Knollie Wileman 08/14/1988 GaryKnollie Wileman, was the operator and sole occupant of the Honda. He located unresponsive in the vehicle. EMTs resuscitated Wileman with narcan. He then went into cardiac arrest on the way to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma. Wileman was pronounced deceased at 1334 hours. An autopsey was completed. The autopsy revealed that Wileman had abbrassions to his face and scape, a fractured pelvis, and a transection of the proximal descending thoracic aorta and left hemothorax. His cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma and internal bleeding. Toxicology was positive for xylazine, cyclobenzaprine, fentanyl, trazadone, and desproprionyl fentanyl.  Section VI. - Follow-up Investigation:  10/20/2023:Reviewed autopsy results.  Section VII. - Analysis of Electronic Control Modules:  Cpl Lantz # 5563, MSP CRASH Team, downloaded the electronic control module for the Honda. Two collision events were captured. The first event occurred at 78 mph and the second event occurred at 63 mph. There was no pre-imapct braking from the operator. The first event is likely the vehicle traveling off the roadway. The second event was the vehicle traveling up the embankment and then colliding with the tree.  The operators seat belt was not engaged.  Section VIII. - Speed Analysis:  There was insufficient roadway evidence to support a speed analysis.  Section IX. - Crash Dynamics:  The vehicle traveled off the roadway to the left and partially up the center median embankment. It then collided with a tree at 63 mph.  Section X. - Attachments that were included in for this report:  The following items were attached to this report: ACRS Photos uploaded to Veripic  Conclusion: The following conclusions are based upon the totality of the investigation, including the physical evidence accumulated, as well as the reports submitted by other investigators concerning this incident. Based on this evidence I have come to the following conclusions.  On 09/18/2023 at approximately 1317 hours, the Honda, operated byGary Knollie Wileman, traveled off the roadway at northbound MD-295 south of I-895 into the center median. The Honda then collided with a tree at 63 mph in a posted 55 mph zone. Wileman sustained life-threatening injuries in the collision and was transported by ambulance toR Adams Cowley Shock Trauma where he was pronounced deceased at 1334 hours. Wilemanstoxicology results were positive for multiple controlled dangerous substances. The initial cause for the Honda traveling off the roadway was likely a narcotic analgesic overdose.  This case is closed due to the death of at-fault party.  TFC Bunger # 6459 Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack 8908 Kelso Dr Essex MD 21221 410-780-2700</NarrativeText>
