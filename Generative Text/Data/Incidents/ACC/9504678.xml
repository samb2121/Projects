         <NarrativeText>C-8 is equipped with a mobile recording device Defendant: Ryan, Daniel Lee Date of Birth: 07-16-1984 Date of Arrest: 09-29-2023 Times of Arrest: 2051 hours MD Soundex: MD10274279000 DUI # - 23-099 (Cumberland)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Sunday 09/29/2023 at approximately 2016 hours the MSP Cumberland Barrack received a call for an accident that occurred on McMullen HWY at Niners Lane. The Barrack was advised it was a multiple vehicle accident.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I arrived on scene and observed multiple vehicles. One vehicle was parked on the right shoulder on southbound McMullen Highway and another was on the right shoulder on the northbound side of McMullen Highway. I made contact with the vehicle on the southbound side first. I was able to make contact with the driver of vehicle 2 and identified her as Sydney Renee Coldiron. Coldiron and the other passengers in the vehicle advised they were traveling southbound on McMullen Highway when vehicle 1 began to pull out from Niners Lane. I made contact with the driver of vehicle 1 and was able to identify him as Daniel Lee Ryan, DOB: 07-16-1974. While speaking with Ryan I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his person. I asked Ryan what happened and he advised he was just leaving his house up the street to get soda for his girlfriend. Ryan advised that he stopped at the stop sign and the car came over and struck his vehicle. After observing both vehicles and hearing both sides it was obvious Ryan had pulled out and attempted to turn northbound on McMullen Highway. He failed to stop and yield to oncoming traffic. While speaking with Ryan I asked how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed prior to driving and he stated Two at a wedding reception. While speaking with Ryan I observed him to have slurred speech as well as bloodshot eyes. I asked Ryan if he was willing to do voluntary SFSTs and he advised he would.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed in the parking lot of Hamm  Glasbrenner CPAs in Cumberland MD. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear. Lighting conditions consisted of pole lights and my flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Ryan appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Ryan the following questions: Glasses or Contacts  None Medical Conditions  None Injuries  None Medication  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my index finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15, slightly above eye level. Ryan was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Ryans pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Ryan was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. The test was attempted while Ryan was sitting in the drivers seat of the vehicle. I attempted to do the test on Ryan but due to the positioning in the seat the test wasnt able to be completed. I attempted to get Ryan out of the vehicle and complete tests multiple times but he refused. While attempting the test I observed him to have very constricted pupils.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation  Both eyes   margin-left:8px"&gt;Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees  Both eyes    WALK AND TURN (6/8) Prior to Ryan performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Ryan was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary line on the sidewalk. Ryan was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Ryan was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Ryan was instructed to keep her hands flat at her sides, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Ryan was explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Ryan was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Ryan was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her sides, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Ryan if she understood the test and she stated, Yes. Pre Test Phase     margin-left:8px"&gt;Cannot keep balance  First 9 Steps    Missed heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 2, 3, 4 , 8 and 9.  Stepped offline on step 5.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Raised arms on step 5.  Turn     margin-left:8px"&gt;Turned opposite of lead foot.  Second 9     margin-left:8px"&gt;Missed heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 3, 4, 5 and 6.   ONE LEG STAND (4/4) Prior to Ryan performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Ryan was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised she was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Ryan was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.    Put foot down.  Swayed to the left and right.  Hopped on balancing foot.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Raised arms more than 6 inches.   ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Ryan was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcoholic beverages: * Admitted to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving. * Causing an accident. * Slurred speech. * Bloodshot eyes. * Strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from person.  Due to the number of observations, I had reason to believe Ryan was driving under the influence and was unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2051 hours, I placed Ryan under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol. A preliminary search of Ryan was conducted on the scene and it revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to at 2129 hours. Ryan accepted to submit to the intoximeter test.  INTOXIMETER RESULT - *******.21*******  Ryan was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to his girlfriends custody.  Case status: closed by arrest. All events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
