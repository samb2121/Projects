         <NarrativeText>MSP Unmarked Vehicle, D-08: In-Car/Body Camera Operational  Case #: 23-MSP-000388  Arrestee Information:      Defendant: Mahealani Linne Donowa      Date of Birth: 01-04-2000      Date of Arrest: January 4, 2023      Time of Arrest: 0317 hours     CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING      Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      Certified in A.R.I.D.E(Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) to enhance skills to observe, identify, and articulate the signs of impairment related to drugs, alcohol, or a combination of both      VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On January 04, 2023, at approximately 0231 hours, I was dispatched to a single-vehicle accident at Philadelphia Road at Seven Trails Drive for a vehicle that had driven off the roadway.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I arrived on-scene at approximately 0245 hours and observed a black infinity sedan in a ditch off the roadway and young female standing outside the vehicle. I made contact with the female, asking if she was okay. She responded that she was okay, and I could hear that her speech was slurred.  The operator walked toward me as I asked what happened, and she broke down in tears, describing that she had fallen asleep at the wheel, causing the collision. As she stood closer to me and explained what had occurred, I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her breath and person. The operator also mentioned that she had a small child in the vehicle.  I asked the operator to grab her drivers license while I confirmed EMS was en route for her son to be checked out. While she grabbed her license, I observed the Infiniti G35 to be registered via VA, TVJ3167.  I asked the operator where she was coming from, and she informed me she was coming from Darlington. I observed the operators eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. The operator presented me with her drivers license and was identified as Mahealani Linne Donowa(1/F 01-04-2000). The operator continued to explain that she had fallen asleep while navigating the roundabout, and had awakened in the ditch, unaware of where she was because of her falling asleep.  I called out Donowas drivers license information to the Bel Air Barrack, and they checked her information, Donowa returned suspended via the MVA. Fire/EMS arrived on-scene shortly afterward and evaluated Donowa and her child identified as, Khalyll Antonio Hicks(1/M 05-20-2000). Donowa refused further medical treatment for herself and her son, Hicks as their vitals showed stable and they both had no visible serious injuries.  Once Donowa exited the ambulance, I explained to her that I suspected that she was impaired by an alcoholic beverage and asked if she is willing to submit to field sobriety testing, Donowa agreed.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was completed in the roadway. The surface was dry, level, and free from any visible debris. The weather was clear and approximately 40 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of natural moonlight.  I asked Donowa the following questions before proceeding with Standard Field Sobriety Testing:  Injuries - No.  Medical Conditions/Medications  None.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained to Donowa before she had begun the test. I asked Donowa if she understood the tests, and she stated, yes. The following clues and observations were made during this test.      Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes      The onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eye     *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not present in both eyes   WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) The walk and turn test was explained to Donowa before she had begun the test. I asked Donowa if she understood the test, and she stated, Yes. The following clues were observed:  Instructional Stage:      Unable to maintain balance     Walking Stage (1st Nine):      Missed heel-to-toe      Too many steps     Walking Stage (2nd Nine):      Missed heel-to-toe      Too many steps     Turn:      Completed unsatisfactory      ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)  The one-leg stand test was explained to Donowa before she had begun the test. I asked Donowa if she understood the test to which she replied, yes. The following clues were observed.  Balance  Count Stage -  Seconds 0-10:      Swayed      Raised Arms      Puts foot down     Seconds 11-20:      Swayed      Raised Arms     Seconds 21-30:      Swayed      Raised Arms      ARREST:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Donowa was driving while impaired:      Donowas admittance to ingesting alcoholic beverages prior to operating the motor vehicle      Donowas slurred speech      The odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Donowas breath and her person      Donowas bloodshot and glassy eyes      Donowa motor vehicle accident       Donowa was placed under arrest at 0317 hours.  Donowa was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle.  I transported Donowa to Bel Air Barrack for further processing.  I read the DR15 at 0351 hours and Donowa refused.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:  Nothing to report.   INTOXIMETER RESULT: REFUSED   Donowa was picked up by her boyfriend from the Bel Air Barrack.  I request the case be closed.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
