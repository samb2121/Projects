         <NarrativeText>Detailed Crash Investigation Report (For review by the MSPCrash Team)  Section I. - Introduction:  The collision occurred on Wednesday, May 31, 2023 at approximately 2256 hours. The collision was a two vehicle collision. Vehicle 1 was a 2004 Harley Davidson Sportster. Vehicle #2 was a 2007 Jeep Compass. Vehicle #1 was traveling westbound in the eastbound lanes of Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) west of Maryland Route 194 (Woodsboro Pike). Vehicle #2 was traveling eastbound on Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) east of the Monocacy River bridge. The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling the wrong direction on Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) when Vehicle #1 struck Vehicle #2 head on in lane one of the eastbound lanes. The driver of Vehicle #1, Joseph Franklin Carter, succumbed to those injuries sustained in the collision and was pronounced deceased on scene at 2301 hours.   text-align:center"&gt;  Section II. - Scene Description: (The following descriptions are based on the area where the collision occurred.) Primary Roadway:Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road)  Maryland Route 26, also known as Liberty Road, was a divided highway that traveled east and west. That particular stretch of highway was a straightaway and was level in elevation. On the eastbound lanes where the collision occurred, the travel lanes were separated by dotted white lines. The left shoulder consisted of a solid yellow fog line. On the outside of the fog line was an asphalt shoulder, and the concrete traffic barrier separating the eastbound lanes and westbound lanes. The right shoulder consisted of a white fog line. On the outside of the fog line was an asphalt shoulder and then the guardrail. The roadway surface was constructed with asphalt. It should be noted, this section of the eastbound side of Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) contained three (3) travel lanes. Two (2) of the travel lanes continued onto Maryland Route 194 (Woodsboro Pike), and one (1) of the travel lanes was an exit lane (leading to ramp) to continue onto Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road).   The posted speed limit for Maryland Route 26 was 50 miles per hour.  Secondary Roadway (if applicable):Maryland Route 194 (Woodsboro Pike) Maryland Route 194, also known as Woodsboro Pike, was an undivided highway that traveled north and south. It should be noted, the collision occurred west of the intersection for Maryland Route 194 (Woodsboro Pike) and Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road). That particular stretch of highway was curving towards the right, and was downhill in elevation. The roadway surface was constructed with asphalt.   Environmental Conditions: At the time of the collision the weather was reported as clear skies, humid, with a temperature of approximately 57 Fahrenheit. There were no adverse weather conditions that contributed to the cause of the collision. Lighting conditions were dark, with no working street lights.    text-align:center"&gt;  Section III. - Scene Evidence:  I conducted a walk through of the scene and the evidence that had been located. Vehicle #1 was located at its position of final rest on the left asphalt shoulder of the eastbound lanes, facing in a westerly direction. Vehicle #2 was located between lane one and lane two of the eastbound lanes, facing in a western direction. Digital photographs were taken of the scene and evidence during the investigation.  I began my investigation west of the collision scene. I observed several gouge marks in the area of impact, which was located just east of the Monocacy River bridge in lane one (left lane). I observed several scrape marks from the area of impact, continuing towards the final resting point of Vehicle #2. I also observed scrape marks continuing towards the final resting point of Vehicle #1. I observed a large debris field from the rear of Vehicle #2, continuing towards Vehicle #1. I observed an offset tire mark in lane one of the eastbound lane of the roadway caused from Vehicle #2 after being struck from Vehicle #1.The face shield of the driver was located near the first collision scene.    text-align:center"&gt;  Section IV. - Vehicle(s) Involved:  Vehicle #1:2004 Harley Davidson Sportster 1200 bearing Maryland registration 058Y81.  There was extensive damage located on the front end of the vehicle. There was evidence located on the front of the vehicle which showed that it had struck Vehicle #2 head on. It should be noted, the front wheel section below the handlebars was no longer connected to the motorcycle. The vehicle was found at the collision scene on the left asphalt shoulder of the eastbound lanes where Vehicle #1 came to a position of final rest. The vehicle was not equipped with airbags.   The driver was confronted by several witnesses, and the driver picked up the motorcycle, and fled the collision scene, continuing to travel westbound in the eastbound lanes of Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) until the vehicle struck Vehicle #2. See witness statements for additional details.    Vehicle #2: 2007 Jeep Compass bearing Maryland registration 1ER6397.  There was extensive damage located on the front end of the vehicle. There was evidence located on the front of the vehicle which showed that it had struck Vehicle #1 head on. I observed the front bumper was crushed towards the frame and engine compartment area. The hood of the vehicle was also crushed from the front bumper area, pushed towards the middle section of the vehicle. The evidence found on the vehicle was consistent with the vehicle striking Vehicle #1 while traveling in the eastbound lanes of the roadway. The drivers seat belt of Vehicle 2 was extended with slack and locked, this indicated to me that the driver of Vehicle 2 was wearing a seat belt. I observed the front airbags were deployed in the collision. It should be noted, after the collision with Vehicle #1, the front of Vehicle #2 caught fire, and the fire had to be put out by EMS/Fire personnel.     text-align:center"&gt;  Section V. - Person(s) Involved:  Person #1:Joseph Franklin Carter (DOB 12/19/1983, #2/M) (DECEASED) 16 Antietam Drive, Keedysville, Maryland 21756  Joseph Franklin Carter was the driver of Vehicle #1. The driver of Vehicle #1 was also thrown from the vehicle. He had been found lying in the travel portion of the roadway, directly behind Vehicle #2. Carter had to be forcibly removed out of the roadway onto the shoulder to be medically assisted by EMS personnel. He had sustained massive trauma to chest area. The driver was wearing an approved DOT helmet during the collision which was buckled. There were also large scrapes on the top of Carters helmet, and the face shield was missing. When I first observed Carter, he was lying on his back on the left asphalt shoulder. Carter was pronounced deceased on scene at 2301 hours by Medic Steele.It should be noted, Carter was wearing work boots, khaki shorts, and a leather jacket during the time of the collision.  Carterhad been transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) in Baltimore, Maryland for a post mortem examination. The OCME case number was #23-06790. Upon review of the report filed by Eli Goodman, M.D., Assistant Medical Director, it revealed that Carter had received numerous injuries. The cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma of the head, neck, torso, and extremities, and manner of death was ruled as accident. I had a conversation with the Forensic Investigator on scene, Brian Shriner, in which I had explained to him the facts surrounding the investigation. Shriner had advised me that all injury evidence was found to be consistent with the motor vehicle collision. Toxicology results for were positive for alcohol,with a BAC range of .17-.21.    Person #2:Carmela Dannette Spencer (DOB 12/26/1977, #1/F) 415 West Wilson Boulevard Hagerstown, Maryland 21740  Spencer was the operator of Vehicle #2. Spencer was transported to Frederick Health Hospital (FHH) with non-life-threatening injuries.(Ambulance 249, EMS Run #F23016766. At 2334 hours, on 05/31/2023, TFC Coss #6568 of the MSP Frederick Barrack, met with Spencer at FHH to complete a written witness statement.  In Spencers written witness statement, she stated she was traveling eastbound on Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road), traveling in lane one (left lane/fast lane). Spencer then advised a motorcycle traveling in the wrong direction (Vehicle #1) on Maryland Route 26, struck her vehicle (Vehicle #2) in the fast lane. Spencer advised after she was struck, her vehicle was spun, and she ended up facing the opposite direction. In Spencers written statement, she advised the visibility was Good.   Person #3:Mariah Brook Ricasa (DOB 08/24/1994, #2/M) (WITNESS) 6183 South Steamboat Way New Market, Maryland 21774  It should be noted, Ricasa was an original 911 caller (#443-909-0006) who reported the collision. In Ricasas written witness statement, she stated she was traveling eastbound on Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road), about to turn and continue onto eastbound Maryland Route 26. Ricasa advised she then observed a motorcycle (Vehicle #1) traveling toward her going the wrong direction. Ricasa then advised she observed the motorcycle (Vehicle #1) strike the median and the operator fell over. It should also be noted, before the collision with Vehicle #2, the driver of Vehicle #1 struck a concrete curb and concrete median area while traveling in the opposite lane of travel on Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road), west of the intersection for Maryland Route 194 (Woodsboro Pike), traveling westbound in the eastbound lanes. Ricasa then advised she and the car behind her stopped to check on the welfare of the operator of the motorcycle. Ricasa then advised she asked the operator if he needed 911, and he advised no multiple times. Ricasa then advised the car behind her that stopped drove away, and the operator of the motorcycle got back onto the motorcycle and was Looking dazed, with pieces of the motorcycle remaining. Ricasa then advised she observed the operator of the motorcycle continue to drive the wrong way on Maryland Route 26, and then struck a vehicle (Vehicle #2) head on. Ricasa then advised she observed the vehicle (Vehicle #2) spin around, and she then proceeded to call 911. Ricasa then advised she and several bystanders then attempted to pull the operator of the motorcycle away from the vehicle (Vehicle #2), due to the vehicle now being on fire. Ricasa advised after they moved the operator of the motorcycle, she observed a massive cut on the stomach area of the motorcycle operator, and the motorcycle operator was not breathing and did not have a pulse.
