         <NarrativeText>MSP Case # 23-MSP-034488   Maryland State Police Easton Barrack  I The incident was captured via I-24 in car camera and body warn camera.    Training/Certificates: I am trained by the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs).  Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE)  Trained and Certified as a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE)  Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1) Not observed  Personal Contact (Phase 2)  On 10/1/2023, at approximately 1922 hours, I, TFC Cambra #7191 of the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, was dispatched to the area of the Runway Liquors located at 9543 Ocean Gateway, Easton Maryland for a reported motor vehicle collision with no injuries. Upon arrival, I made contact with the driver of what is later determined to be vehicle #2, identified as Akashimiketwa M Barry (DOB: 02/14/1974). Barry stated that he, referring to the driver of vehicle #1 later identified by his Maryland issued drivers license as Calixto Tiul Teyul (DOB: 10/20/1985), rear ended her vehicle and that he was drunk. She stated that Teyul rear ended her and drove off. I made contact with Teyul and asked if he was injured. He responded that he did not speak English. I observed Teyuls vehicle to be a beige Ford Focus bearing Maryland registration 4FM9625 with front end damage. I observed Barrys vehicle to be a blue BMW E3 bearing Maryland registration 9DX2575 to have minor rear end damage. While standing near Teyul, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I observed him to have glassy and blood shot eyes.   I requested both drivers provide their license and registration for the vehicles. Teyul stated his license was in his vehicle. As he walked from the rear of the vehicle to the driver seat, I observed him to slightly stumble towards the driver side door. While peering into the vehicle, I observed an open can of Modelo in the cupholder in the rear cupholder attached to the center console. I observed Teyul to drop his drivers license on the ground prior to providing it to me. I asked for his insurance information, and he again replied that he did not speak English.   I made contact with Barry again and asked what happened. She stated they were stopped at the red light, two lights down (West Bound Ocean Gateway at Matthewstown Rd) when he struck the rear of their vehicle. Teyul then proceed to drive off. They followed him to the parking lot of the gas station and they came to a stop.   I returned to vehicle briefly and then made contact with Teyul again. He was standing next to the driver side of his vehicle with the door open. I observed him to be drinking water from a water bottle. I advised him to put the water bottle down utilizing a translator application. I requested an additional unit to respond to the scene. I asked Teyul what had happened. Teyul ultimately replied that he did not remember what happened. I asked him how many beers he had that day. Teyul stated that he had one beer. He denied drinking anything else. He stated he had his last drink about two hours prior. I asked Teyul where he was coming from and where he was headed. He stated he was coming from Easton and going to Easton. I again asked him and he stated he was going for fuel. I advised him that I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person and that I would like to put him through some tests which he agreed. I asked him if I could pat him down which he agreed.   Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3)   The evaluation was conducted in the parking lot of Runway liquors. All emergency lights were deactivated from all emergency vehicles on scene. The surface was level and clear of any obvious debris. Lighting conditions were night time conditions with functioning lights on the Runway liquors building and on the gas pumps. Weather conditions were clear. Teyul appeared to be in good physical condition and displayed no visible injuries. I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanate from Teyuls breath and person. A Spanish speaking officer was requested which revealed that there was none available. A translator application was used for the duration of the encounter to communicate.    Glasses/Contacts  none  Medical Conditions  none Injuries  none   Medications  none  The first test that was administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus for the test. The test was explained to Teyul utilizing the translator application. I asked Teyul if he understood the directions which he stated he did. I observed Teyul to still have glassy blood shot eyes. He displayed equal pupil size, no resting nystagmus, and his eyes tracked equally.     text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit  present in both eyes   2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  3) Onset Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not observed   I had to advise him to follow the stimulus with his eyes after beginning. I also had to advise him again to not move his head two additional times. I observed Teyul to sway back and forth slightly for the duration of the test. At times he very slightly swayed in a circular motion.    Walk and Turn (6/8 Clues Observed)    The test was explained and demonstrated to Teyul. While demonstrating the test, Teyul turned and began the test. I advised him to not start yet, and I had him stand back in the instructional stance. At the completion of explaining the test, I asked him if he understood the directions. Teyul stated he understood.   Instructional Phase:  Breaks instructional stance   Starts too soon   Walking Stage (1st Nine):  Raises arms  Steps off line  Improper number of steps  19 steps  Stops Walking  stopped at 19th step and appeared confused on next step  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  Raises arms   Steps off line   Turn: Turned to the left not as directed (spin motion), however became unbalanced and lost his footing prior to beginning the second set of steps.   One Leg Stand (/4 Clues Observed)   The test was explained and demonstrated to Teyul. After completing the test, I asked him if he understood the directions which he stated he did. Teyul elected to raise his right leg.   Instructional Phase: He began the test three times prior to being advised to do so.   Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 1-10: Raises arms  Seconds 11-20: Raises arms Puts foot down  Seconds 21-30:  Puts foot down  After beginning the test, Teyul was not looking at his foot as directed. He also wasnt counting during the test. I prompted him to count, he started counting to three. I stopped the test to re-explain some of the directions. He stated he understood and the clock was restarted for the test. He began to count, and again was directed to continue counting. He neglected to look down at his foot for the test.   Preliminary Breath Test: Teyul was offered a PBT. He was explained that the test was voluntary and that it could not be used against him in court. He agreed to the PBT. PBT result .29. There were two breaths taken for the PBT.   Arrest  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Teyul was driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Involved in a two-vehicle collision  Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person  Glassy eyes  Blood shot eyes  Poor balance at times   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Clues observed during Standardized field sobriety tests   Due to the number of observations I placed Teyul under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 2000 hours. Teyuls mouth was check and was found to be free of all debris. Teyul was searched. He was then placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle as per department policy and regulation. A tow truck was requested for his vehicle. Teyul was transported to the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack for processing.  While traveling to the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. A secondary search of Teyul was conducted at the Barrack. Teyul was provided a copy of the DR-15 (reverse side in Spanish) to follow along. Utilizing the official DR-15 audio from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, Teyul was advised his DR-15 rights in Spanish. The room that the DR-15 was advised in was well lit by commercial ceiling lights. Teyul agreed to the intoximeter test at 2032 hours.   Intoximeter: Test administered by Cpl. Huntington #5930 Intoximeter result: .18  Teyul was issued the appropriate citations for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was also provided a copy the DR-15 and DR-15a. An ACRS report was completed for the collision. All other necessary paperwork was completed as per department policy and regulation.   Teyul was released to a valid and sober driver at the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack.   Teyul was polite and cooperative for the duration of the encounter.   All events occurred in Talbot County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.   </NarrativeText>
