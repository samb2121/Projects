Defendant: Brionna Lashawn Brigham Drivers license #: DC 5028848 Date of Arrest: 5/26/23 Time of Arrest: 0241 hours DUI #: 23-96-135 PBT Results: 0.10 Intoximeter Results: 0.08   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING   -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. -Trained ARIDE test through the Maryland State Police. -Completed certified SFST instructor class.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 05/26/2023 at approximately 0223 hours, I, Trooper First Class C. Shubert #7062 with the Maryland State Police was on-duty and operating unmarked patrol vehicle V-11 in the area of Coastal Highway and 52nd St (Ocean City). At that time, I was southbound in lane one. I observed in front of me traveling southbound in lane two, a blue Hyundai Tucson bearing DC registration (JD1203) that appeared to be traveling above the posted speed limit. I then activated my Kustom Golden Eagle radar front antenna and obtained a digital speed reading of 51MPH in a posted 35MPH speed zone. I also observed the vehicle fail to stop prior to the stop line by half the width of the vehicle when at the intersection. I activated the emergency equipment to my patrol vehicle and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle pulled into the Seacrets located on 49th St and came to a complete stop.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the driver. I advised the driver why she was being stopped. While speaking with the driver, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. The drivers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I identified the driver as Brionna Lashawn Brigham through her DC identification card. I asked Brigham where she was coming from, to which she advised:Coming from our hotel. I then asked Brigham how many alcoholic beverages she consumed prior to driving to which she advised:Not too much, I had a drink earlier.I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine MVA checks on Brigham. I later returned to Brighams vehicle and asked her to step out and to walk to the front of her vehicle. Brigham complied. While at the front of her vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Brighams breath and person. I asked Brigham how many alcoholic beverages she consumed in total, to which she advised:A drink earlier, Jameson cranberry.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed in the Seacrets parking lot. The surface was flat and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 59 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight, vehicle headlights, and parking lot lighting. My forward emergency equipment was deactivated during all testing. Brigham appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injury.    I asked Brigham the following pre-testing questions:   1. Injuries: NO 2. Glasses: NO 3. Medications:NO    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6 of 6 clues observed)   1. Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes. 2. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3. Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes. ***NOTE*** Brigham had vertical gaze nystagmus present   WALK AND TURN (2 of 8 clues observed) (wearing heels)   Instructional Stage:       margin-left:8px"&gt;Started the test prior to being told to begin    Walking Stage (1st Nine):      Missed heel to toe contact more than half an inch on steps 4, 6.    Walking Stage (2nd Nine):      Stepped off the line on step 7.      Missed heel to toe contact more than half an inch on step 1, 3, 5.

Brigham completed this test satisfactorily.    COUNTING TEST      I asked Brigham if she could count backwards, to which she stated:Yes.I instructed Brigham to count backwards from 57 to 36. Brigham completed this test satisfactorily.     PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST   I offered Brigham the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test, and Brigham submitted to the preliminary breath test with a reading of 0.10 BrAC.   ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Brigham was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   * Exceeding the posted speed limit. * Crossing the stop line * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as she performed field sobriety tests.   At approximately 0241 hours, I placed Brigham under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I placed Brigham in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. While still on-scene, I played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Brigham via the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) official website. At the conclusion of the audio version of the DR-15 form, I verbally repeated and reviewed the possible suspensions and sanctions that can be imposed by the MVA to Brighams driving privilege. Brigham submitted to the Intoximeter test and signed the same at approximately 0253 hours.   TRANSPORT   Brigham was subsequently transported to the Ocean City Police Department for processing. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Brigham continued to be strong.   ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION TEST RESULT: 0.08 BrAC   Prior to the test, PFC Paterson #3747 (certified intoximeter operator) checked Brighams mouth for any foreign objects and none were found. PFC Paterson administered the breath test at approximately 0336 hours with a result of 0.08 BrAC.   RELEASE   Brigham was released to her friend at the Simple life hotel located off of 31st Street in Ocean City.   CHARGES   Brigham was charged with the following:   1.
