STATEMENT: COLLINS stated that the fight at GOODINS residence was a continuation of his altercation with STOWERS (Ref23-MSP-019137). COLLINS continued that he had been hanging out at GOODINS house and that GOODIN told him that BAKER had texted him about coming over as well. And that GOODIN responded yea but dont bring anyone to BAKER. COLLINS stated that he didnt find out until later on 5/29/23 that BAKER had texted GOODIN and that if he had known that BAKER was coming over, COLLINS would have left.When asked if he knew who broke the glass, COLLINS stated that he thought it was BAKER. COLLINS stated initially he saw BAKER at the backdoor but then he saw Lila, Lexi and four other girls with BAKER. GOODIN stated that he remembered STOWERS slapping him at some point. COLLINS stated that BAKER hit him and pushed him on the bed. COLLINS stated that GOODIN that got BAKER off of COLLINS. COLLINS stated that after the fight stopped between himself and BAKER, the females that had originally arrived with BAKER were now on COLLINS side and holding STOWERS back. COLLINS stated that KING had also hit him during the fight.  VICTIM (Assaulted by GOODIN): CHARLES WILLIAM BAKER 3/6/07 ***JUVENILE***  SUSPECT(Assaulted COLLINS): CHARLES WILLIAM BAKER 3/6/07 ***JUVENILE*** 6829 Acacia Court, Frederick , MD Mother: Tonya Black 301-305-6367 STATEMENT: As I first walked up to make contact with BAKER, who was already standing with other troopers, I heard him saying ...when I see him at school, Im going to beat the shit out of him, referring to GOODIN. BAKER continued I went in there to beat up Torrance because he beat up a girl. When informed that I was now on scene to talk about that fight, BAKER continuing speaking to me and told me that he went over to Shanes (GOODIN) and went into his basement and I plucked him in the face. When asked how he got into the basement, BAKER stated he is best friends with Shane and just walked in. BAKER admitted again that after asking him about beating up girls, he punched COLLINS in the mouth. BAKER continued and stated that he was on top of COLLINS on the bed at one point and that during this time Shane began to punch him in the back of his head. BAKER stated that right now he couldnt do anything because of the number of police on scene but when he saw him at school he was going to beat the living life out of him. BAKER continued that he had been contacted by  a whole bunch of girls telling BAKER how one of them had just been beaten up by a boy.  Around this time, when attempting to contact his parents, BAKER became more agitated and began to argue with SGT Freyz and stated he didnt give a shit about anything. BAKER continued to state that when he saw GOODIN and COLLINS at school he was going to fight them, multiple times. BAKER continued to become agitated during the car ride and complained that he was only sticking up for a friend and fuck you all. When asked again if he wanted an ambulance due to his head hurting, BAKER stated No I told you, I dont need a fucking ambulance. From this point, interactions with BAKER devolved into him yelling at everyone around him, stating he didnt care and demanding to be taken to 69 Oxford Ct multiple times.  SUSPECT/WITNESS: SHANE ANTHONY GOODIN 3/30/07 ***JUVENILE*** 101 Adams Way, Walkersville MD Mother: Sophia Warfield240-439-5438 STATEMENT GOODIN stated that the fight that just occurred was a result of the assault that had occurred earlier between COLLINS and STOWERS (Ref 23-MSP-019137). GOODIN stated that some dude Charles and STOWERS and other girls came over to his house. GOODIN stated that Charles/BAKER, just walked into his basement room and hit COLLINS. GOODIN admitted that as BAKER was assaulting COLLINS, GOODIN started to hit BAKER.GOODIN stated that all the other females finally were able to get BAKER out of the bedroom and out the back door. In reference to the glass being broken, GOODIN indicated that it had been BAKER throwing the wood at the door. While on scene, GOODIN contacted BAKER over the phone and began to argue with him.  Once he had calmed down some, GOODIN further added that he had invited COLLINS over and BAKER had texted him about coming over as well. GOODIN stated that he had begun to allow BAKER in but once he saw STOWERS behind him he knew something was up. GOODIN stated that STOWERS then smacked COLLINS twice. GOODIN stated that was when BAKER punched COLLINS, causing COLLINS to fall to the bed. GOODIN admitted that he hit BAKER in the head a few times at this point. Eventually, GOODIN stated they were able to get the party out of JUVENILES onto the patio.  When I spoke later with GOODIN and his mother again on 5/29/23 and 5/30/23, he informed me that he had heard that Madelyn Queen had been the one to throw the wood that broke the window. He had also informed me he spoke to BAKER and his mother on the phone with his mother WARFIELD, about the incident. GOODIN stated that BAKERS mother stated that GOODIN should not have allowed BAKER in the room and implied it was GOODINS fault the assault occurred.  SUSPECT: LILA BRANDY STOWERS 9/6/07 ***JUVENILE*** 69 Oxford Ct, Walkersville MD Mother: Shanon Grossnickle 240-285-2887  SUSPECT: LEXI NICOLE KING 8/26/08 ***JUVENILE*** 11919 Creagerstown Rd, Woodsboro MD 240-586-3233  SUSPECT: MADELYN QUEEN Unknown DOB at this time ***JUVENILE*** 8614 Discovery Blvd, Walkersville MD  SCENE PROCESSING: Upon arrival at 101 Adams Way, Walkersville, I was taken downstairs to the basement room by the occupants. In the basement room, I observed a glass door and a glass pannel next to it that go out into the backyard/back patio of the property. After stepping outside onto the patio, I observed a large amount of small glass shards on the patio. I observed on the glass pannel next to the actual door, a large hole through the glass. (See Attachments) I also observed the remaining glass still in the frame was fractured/spider-webbed and actively still falling as the door was open and shut. Directly in front of the broken pannel, just a foot or two away, I observed a number of small pieces of fire wood. Due to the nature of the call at that time, I returned on the evening of 5/29/23 to take photos of the door and wood (See Attachments). By this time, I observed that the few pieces of firewood that were originally closer to the door at the time of the event, was not organized closer back to the woodpile as I took the photos.The original state of the wood and door can be observed on my body worn camera.  On 5/29/23, while speaking with COLLINS and his mother at 202 Heritage Ct, I was informed of a video of the assault they had on their phones. COLLINS mother, CeCe Chambers showed me the video on her phone. I observed the following:  An unknown person is recording three individuals I immediately recognize as CHARLES WILLIAM BAKER and LILA BRANDY STOWERS. The third individual in a green hooded sweatshirt with the hood up, was identified as LEXI NICOLE KING by GOODIN and COLLINS. The group are seen entering the back basement door of 101 Adams Way into the basement bedroom of GOODIN. Inside the bedroom, I also recognize GOODIN and COLLINS, already inside the bedroom. It appears they are forcing their way in as GOODIN is telling them to leave multiple times.  The group immediately begin to argue and I observe STOWERS begin to spit multiple times at/onto COLLINS. During this time, it appears GOODIN is standing between BAKER and the group of juvenile females and protect COLLINS. Eventually, BAKER gets close enough to COLLINS and a physical fight occurs on the bed. I observe BAKER aggressively strike COLLINS in the head/upper body area multiple times while COLLINS is laying on the bed attempting to protect his head and appears to be curled up. During this time I also observe GOODIN strike BAKER in the back of the head. It is also during this time that I observe KING strike COLLINS while BAKER is assaulting him. KING is heard laughing during this time, as she appears to be doing during the majority of the video.Eventually, the assault ends with GOODIN in between the group yet again. The group continues to argue and eventually begins to leave the room and the video then ends.  Injuries: I did not observe any injuries on COLLINS when I spoke with him on 5/29/23. The other troopers that made contact with him around the time of this call, informed me that he did not require medical attention that night/early morning.  BAKER only complained of his head hurting and declined EMS multiple times. Later his mother stated she believes he may have a bump on the back of his head.  Interaction with BAKER: BAKER was extraordinarily uncooperative and highly agitated with both law enforcement and his mother. BAKER refused to put his seat belt on while attempting to transport him to the Walkersville Sheetz for his mother to pick him up. BAKER was very emotional and extremely agitated during his time with law enforcement. After arriving at the Sheetz to transfer custody of BAKER to his mother, BAKER initially entered the back seat of her van. After speaking with his mother about the events of the evening and instructing her to NOT take BAKER back to 69 Oxford Ct, BAKER then opened the door again and began to yell at law enforcement and his mother demanding that he be taken to 69 Oxford Ct (STOWERS house). After a few moments of his this and his agitation only increasing, troopers on scene stepped away from the van, however remained on scene, in order to deescalate the situation and to allow his mother to attempt to resolve the issue and get him home. For almost an hour, I observed/heard BAKER refuse to allow his mother to shut the rear van door in order to leave and argue with his mother. BAKER appeared to calm at some point, calm enough to the point I did not hear him yelling at her. Multiple times during this time, I observed all parties mange to get in the van with the doors shut, however the van would ultimately not leave the area. After one attempt at leaving and coming to another stop, I observed BAKERS mother exit the passenger seat and swap with the driver, a larger male described as her friend. The male then sat in the front passenger seat of the van, the seat directly in front of the seat BAKER was seated in. After another period of time, the van eventually left the parking lot. At this time, I cleared the scene, as well as other troopers.  I was informed later by TFC Carr, that while he was still on scene, BAKER and his mother arrived back in the parking lot after we had cleared. TFC Carr informed me that he advised BAKERS mother that taking BAKER to 69 Oxford Ct, like he had been demanding for hours, could potentially be dangerous for BAKER as it appeared that GOODIN may have family members in that area, wishing to assault BAKER.  NARRATIVE: On 5/29/23 at approximately 0142 hours, MSP Frederick units were advised of a disturbance in the area of 101 Adams Way, Walkersville. I immediately recognized this address as the home of SHANE ANTHONY GOODIN, who I had transported there earlier on the late evening of 5/28/23 in reference to another juvenile disturbance (Ref 23-MSP-019137). Additional units advised they would be en route as well to assist. Upon my arrival, I made contact with SHANE and his mother SOPHIA WARFIELD inside 101 Adams Way. SHANE provided the above statement/information. During this time they also took me down to the basement bedroom where the incident had occurred (See Scene Processing). Around this time, additional units arrived on scene. While I continued to speak with SHANE, the additional units began to check the area for the suspect Charles. It was also during this time, GOODIN called his friend and victim in this most recent assault, TORRANCE COLLINS. I then spoke with COLLINS over the phone and obtained his address, 202 Heritage Ct, and advised him to stay there till police arrived on scene to check on him for any injuries and obtain a statement.  A few moments after this, additional barrack units informed me that they had located the suspect a short distance away in the area of Colony Ct and S Glade Rd. I then joined TFC Carr, TFC Riggs, TFC Willhite and SGT Freyz with Charles. After determining Charles, later identified to be CHARLES WILLIAM BAKER 3/6/7, was a juvenile, I then obtained his home address and contact information for his mother. After being informed that he was going with a parent/family member for the evening, BAKER initially stated that he had been staying at his aunts at 69 Oxford Ct. in town. I immediately recognized this address to be the primary residence of LILA BRANDY STOWERS.Given the multiple complaints and past interactions with STOWERS, especially the multiple ones already involving her just this evening, I informed BAKER that I would not be taking him to that address, and instead directly to his mother. It was around this time that I requested other units make attempt with the victim, COLLINS, at his residence at 202 Heritage Ct to check his welfare and obtain a statement about the fight. I then began to attempt to transport BAKER from the Colony Ct area to the 6829 Acacia Ct, Frederick MD address he had provided.  After a few minutes of driving S/B on 194, I then pulled over as BAKER refused to place his seat belt on. I then contacted BAKERS mother over the phone. BAKERS mother informed me that SHANON GROSSNICKLE (STOWERS mother) is not BAKERS aunt. During this phone call, BAKER already began to talk over myself and his mother and informing his mother to take him to 69 Oxford Ct. BAKERS mother, later identified as TONYA BLACK, informed me that she could come pick BAKER up at the Walkersville Sheetz. BAKER continued to refuse to place his seatbelt on after multiple requests. For a period of time, I parked on the S/B side of 194 just prior to Sheetz over concern that if we arrived at the Sheetz prior to his mother arriving, BAKER would attempt to exit and run from the vehicle based upon his behavior and statements made. It was around this time that TFC Willhite stopped out with us to assist. It was also during my time in th vehicle with BAKER, that he continued to demonstrate an extreme aggression/highly emotional state and stated/indicated multiple times that he did not care and wanted to finish the fight with GOODIN and COLLINS as soon as possible, or as early as when they all went back to school at Walkersville High School.  I then completed transporting BAKER to the Sheetz once I knew his mother was close by. Multiple units and myself remained on scene at the Sheetz due to BAKERS behavior, even after custody had been turned over to his mother (See Scene Processing). While observing this behavior, SGT Freyz then made contact with CPL Baum in reference to contacting DJS for their possible assistance. Ultimately, this was not needed. After an extended period of time of this behavior, BLACK was seen leaving the Sheetz with BAKER in the vehicle.  CPS involvement/contact and CINS referral: I later spoke to CPL Baum in the early hours of 5/29/23 about submitting a Child in Need of Supervision referal (CINS) for STOWERS and BAKER due to their behavior. CPL Baum later emailed me and informed me that he had spoke to Rebecca Biggs with Department of Social Services and completed a referal for both STOWERS and BAKER. I later spoke with CPS and attempted to obtain instructions on how to submit a CINS referal. However, at this time I received uncertain information. I then reached out directly to Diana Walker with the Juvenile Entry Diversion Initiative (JEDI). Diana was able to provide me with additional information for completing a CINS referal. I will be speaking with the States Attorney again in reference to this case and BAKER and STOWERS.  Later on 5/29/23, I made contact with COLLINS in person at his residence, where I obtained the above statement. I also made contact with GOODIN later that evening where he was issued an MSP 53 charging him with assault for his role in the fight in his room in the early hours of 5/29/23. It was during this visit, I was able to take photos of the broken door and some of the wood I believed had been used in the breaking of the glass (See Attachments)  All above events occurred in Frederick County, MD.  I request this case remain open pending contact and charging of all juveniles involved</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>NARRATIVE: Per my phone conversation with Erin Pearl at the Frederick County SAO, I am completing a supplement on this report requesting a Child in Need of Supervision(CINS) for CHARLES WILLIAM BAKER. I am requesting a CINS referal for BAKER based upon my personal interaction with BAKER and my observation of BAKER interacting with his mother (See original narrative). BAKER demonstrated an obvious disregard for local (town curfew) and state laws (assault, disorderly, MDOP) , openly admitted multiple times to law enforcement that he would severely assault other juveniles in the near future. BAKER also appeared to have difficulty controlling his emotions/anger and stated that he didnt care about anything. BAKER threatened to run away from his mother in order to get back to the address he wanted to go to or to find and assault GOODIN and COLLINS again. BAKER spent over an hour demanding/yelling that his mother take him to a residence, 69 Oxford Ct, that they had been instructed not to return to due to the ongoing juvenile fights occurring that evening.  I was later informed on 5/29/23, that BAKER had in fact been dropped off at 69 Oxford Ct by his mother, even after having spent a significant amount of time trying to him in her van and to leave the Sheetz and take him home. It appears from my observations and his mothers own admission, that BAKERS mother has an extremely difficult time controlling him.  BAKER will be charged criminally as a minor for his role in the assault/MDOP but in addition to that I am also requesting a CINS referral for him at this time if that is still an available option for him. I believe BAKER absolutely fits the criteria for a child in need of supervision and any additional assistance/programs for him would be beneficial for both his safety and the publics.  I request this case remain open.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>*Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack* Vehicle: Blue Unmarked Ford Explorer B-69 Body Camera Equipped and Functioning: Yes In-car Camera Equipped and Functioning: No, due to nature of call  ATTACHMENTS: KING 53 KING Miranda rights BAKER 53 STOWERS 53  SUSPECT: JESSICA QUEEN 6/20/06 ***JUVENILE***  SUSPECT/PERSON OF INTEREST: MADELYN QUEEN 5/29/09 ***JUVENILE***  SUSPECT/CHARGED: CHARLES WILLIAM BAKER 3/6/7 ***JUVENILE***  SUSPECT/CHARGED: LEXI NICOLE KING 8/26/08 STATEMENT: (1st discussion) Initially, KING stated I really dont even know, they pulled up on somebody, I was sitting in the car.... KING was initially vague with details names and locations and that she was sleepy/tired at the time. KING was informed that I already knew the fight occurred at GOODINS residence. KING agreed and stated that she knew whose house it was, just not the area of the house. KING stated when she had been in the car she had heard glass breaking but initially stated she didnt know much else.  KING ultimately stated (See Body Cam footage for full statement), that she, Madelyn Queen, Jessica Queen, Lila Stowers, Charles Baker, Dakota(Unknown at this time) and two other unknown males Cain and Martin (Also unknown) had gone over to GOODINS residence in a vehicle. KING stated that once they arrived, they all got out, stating she was the only one who remained in the vehicle. KING stated that she then heard yelling and glass break. After the glass break, she stated they all came running back to the vehicle. When asked what was talked about after they returned to the vehicle, KING stated the group stated oh we broke Shanes window. KING stated that the making argument was over TORRANCE COLLINS. KING stated that Charles (BAKER), was the first one to punch COLLINS. KING stated that Jessica Queen was the one that broke the window, stating Thats who broke the window, I know that.. KING stated Cain had also gone inside the house during the altercation.  When informed of the video of the fight, KING stated that she knew and she had it on her phone. When asked who recorded the video, KING stated she did not know. KING then became upset when stating she could not find the video on her phone and that she wasnt doing this!  NARRATIVE:  Contact/Interview/Charging KING: On 6/8/23 at approximately 2030 hours, I made contact with KING and her grandmother/guardian Virginia Embrey at their residence at 11919 Creagerstown Rd Woodsboro Rd. While on scene, I spoke with KING and Embrey in the driveway in front of their residence. Embrey permitted me to speak with KING. When informed why I was there to speak with them, referencing the fight in Walkersville involving her friends, KING began to openly state okay but that like wasnt with me. I then informed KING and Embrey that I already knew KING was there and needed to talk to everyone involved in the fight. KING then responded yea I was there but I wasnt in the house when it all happened, I was sitting outside in the car. I then stopped KING from speaking further and advised her of her Miranda rights with Embreys permission to speak with KING.  KING was advised of her Miranda rights in front of her grandmother. When initially asked if she was willing to waive her rights and continue to speak with me, KING stated dont care. When informed it was a yes or no, KING stated I dont know, like it doesnt matter to me. When Embrey reminded her again it was either a yes or no, KING responded Sure!. KING then signed the Miranda form at approximately 1945 hours, agreeing to speak with me (See Attachments). KING provided the first portion of the above statement. KING then became upset and ran inside the house when being asked the fight of the video, and after she stated they had the video on her phone.  I then continued to speak with Embrey and explain what has been going on in town regarding KING and her group of friends, the assaults, and that everyone involved was being charged to help curb additional assaults/disordely calls.  KING then joined us again, stated she had new information she wanted to share. KING ultimately just informed me that COLLINS had assaulted STOWERS, which I was already aware of.  Ultimately, KING was charged for 2nd degree assault on an MSP 53, with Embrey signing and receiving her copy.  KING also went on to provide me additional information, in regards to a group of juveniles in town that are known to cary actual firearms. This will be captured in a future report, separate from this incident.  On 6/9/23, I made contact again with GOODINS mother, WARFIELD, via the phone. WARFIELD informed me that she had spoken to Jessica and Madelyn Queen in reference to her broken door. WARFIELD informed me that both sisters denied breaking the glass at her residence the evening of the fight. However, WARFIELD stated that one of the sisters would offer to pay for the glass. WARFIELD also provided me contact information for the landlord of her residence, to confirm the amount to replace the broken glass.  I then made contact with Cinnamon at Just Right Properties (Owner of 101 Adams Way). She informed me that the glass would cost approximately $800 to replace.  I then attempted to make contact with the Queen sisters at their residence at 8614 Discovery Blvd, Walkersville. Upon arrival, I made contact with their father, Christopher Queen (240-534-9042). Christopher informed me he was aware of the incident involving the broken glass. I was also informed that the Queen sisters were not currently home. Christopher stated that JESSICA QUEEN (6/20/06) had offered to pay for the door, since she was the only one who had a job. Christopher also informed me that JESSICA also was the only one in the group that could drive. I informed Christopher more of what was going on with the investigation and with the juvenile group in general. I informed him that I would be attempting to make contact with the three of them in the near future.  I then attempted to make contact with STOWERS and her mother at 69 Oxford Ct. After an extended period of time knocking on the front door at that residence, STOWERS finally answered the door and informed me that her mother had just left but would be back shortly.  Contact with BAKERS mother/charging BAKER: I then contacted BAKERS mother, Tonya Black (301-305-6367), via the phone. Tonya agreed to meet me at a Food Lion parking lot located at 6920 Crestwood Blvd Frederick, near her residence, in order to discuss the investigation and BAKERS charging documents. I then made contact with Tonya in the parking lot and had an extensive conversation about both this investigation, BAKERS charges, a CINS referral being submitted for BAKER and concerns that BAKER is reported to be in possession of an actual firearm. Black signed and received her copy of the MSP 53 charging BAKER with 2nd degree assault. When discussing the investigation, Black stated that she had spoken to BAKER about the incident on 5/29/23 and he informed her that Jessica (Jessica Queen) had been the one to break the glass.   Contact with/charging STOWERS: On 6/14/23 at approximately 1351 hours, I made contact with STOWERS and her mother at their residence at 69 Oxford Ct. STOWERS was issued a MSP 53 charging her with 2nd degree assault for spitting on COLLINS. While issuing the document and explaining to STOWERS and her mother the ongoing issues with the juveniles in town, STOWERS openly admitted that she slapped COLLINS as well as spitting on him. STOWERS also openly indicated that it had been the Queen sisters that been the ones to break the glass door at 101 Adams Way.STOWERS mother, Shanon Grossnickle, signed and received her copy of the MSP 53 charging STOWERS with assault in regards to this case, as well as another MSP 53 charging STOWERS for assault in a related but separate case (Ref23-MSP-019137)  Due to GOODIN informing me that he had heard one of the Queen sisters had been the one to break the glass, both KING and BAKER stating that JESSICA had been the one to break the glass, JESSICA reportedly stating she would be the one to pay for the glass to WARFIELD (Victim), and now STOWERS indicating that one of the Queen sisters had been the ones to break the glass, I will be charging JESSICA with MDOP for the broken glass at 101 Adams Way.  I will be making contact with the Queen sisters in the very near future to resolve/close this case.  All above events occurred in Frederick County, MD.  I request this case remain open.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS: QUEEN sister signed Miranda Rights  NARRATIVE: On 6/28/23, I made contact with the QUEEN sisters at their residence at 8614 Discovery Blvd. I spoke with both sisters and received permission to do so from their father. Both were advised of their rights via MSP 180 (See Attachments) and both agreed to waive their rights and continue speaking with me in reference to this case (See attachments). Ultimately, both sisters stated that they did not break the glass/door at Adams Way, however, of note, JESSICA offered to pay for the door. Based upon the fact JESSICA stated that she does not know/normally hang out with the other juveniles that evening of 5/29/23 and that she was primarily there to look out for her sister, I believe it is likely that MADELYN was the one to break the window and JESSICA is attempting to cover for her.  On 7/23/23, I then made contact again with SOPHIA WARFIELD (renter of 101 Adams Way) via the phone. SOPHIA informed me that she had received a final bill for the door repair that was approximately $250. When asked if she had been paid by the QUEEN sisters yet, SOPHIA stated that had not spoken to them since she last talked to them in June. I informed SOPHIA I would be talking with them one more time. SOPHIA stated as long as the door was paid for, she was not interested in any criminal charges for the door. I will be making contact with the QUEEN sisters again to attempt to resolve the payment issue for the door.  All above events occurred in Frederick County, MD.  I request this case remain open. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>NARRATIVE: On 8/21/23, I made contact again with WARFIELD in person. WARFIELD informed me that Jessica Queen has paid for the majority of the broken door. WARFIELD informed me the case could be closed as she has started receiving financial compensation for the broken door.  All above events occurred in Frederick County, MD.  I request this case be closed by multiple juvenile referrals as well as victim receiving compensation for damaged property.</NarrativeText>
