NARRATIVE:  Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion: On 7/2/23 at approximately 0355 hours, I TFC Eckrich, was on routine patrol in the area of Eastern Shore Dr and College Ave Salisbury MD. At that time I was traveling on Eastern Shore passing College Ave when I noticed a white Toyota Camry bearing South Carolina registration VLJ419 stopped at the intersection. The light for the traffic control signal was green, but the vehicle was not moving. As I passed the vehicle I noticed the driver of the vehicle was asleep. I immediately turned around and activated my emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop and make sure the driver was okay. I noticed the vehicles engine was on, and the brake lights to the vehicle were activated.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact: I exited my patrol vehicle, and made contact with the operator identified by his passport as HUGO ALBERTO SAN MARTIN LOPEZ (H/M 10/17/92). I had to knock on the window a couple of times in order to wake up Lopez. While speaking with Lopez I detected the strong odor of alcoholic beverage coming from within the vehicle. I also observed Lopezs eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I asked Lopez how much he had to drink, and he stated one beer. Lopez kept trying to put the keys in the ignition to turn his car on. At that point I asked Lopez to step out of the vehicle as I relayed his information to MSP Salisbury.   Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening: I explained to Lopez the reason for stepping out of the vehicle. Lopez agreed to perform standardized field sobriety tests. While speaking with Lopez outside his vehicle, I again detected the strong odor of alcoholic beverage but this time it was coming from his breath and person.  Pre-Screening Questions: I asked Lopez a series of questions prior to performing Standardized Field Sobriety Tests: * Visual check of inside of Lopezs mouth: Clear * Glasses: No * Injuries: No *Medications: No  I then began Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and I started with the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus:  I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Lopez. After explaining the test, I asked him if he understood the test and if he had any questions. Lopez stated he understood the test and I began.I had to explain to Lopez multiple times to follow the stimulus with his eyes only and to not move his head.   Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes  Lack of smooth pursuit present in both eyes Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation present in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees was present in both eyes. Vertical Nystagmus was present  Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues:6 of 6   Walk and Turn: Weather: Clear Surface: Level, free of any debris   I instructed Lopez into the instructional phase. Lopez attempted to start the test before being instructed to start. During my explanation of the test Lopez could not maintain his balance and broke heel to toe. I asked Lopez if he understood the instructions and Lopez advised that he understood.  Instructional Phase: -Started too soon -Could not maintain balance  Walking stage 1st 9 Stepped off-line on step 1 Missed heel to toe on steps 2 and 4  Incorrect number of steps: 17  Turn: Incorrect: Lopez spun around in one motion instead of taking a series of small steps as instructed.   Walking stage 2nd 9: Missed heel to toe on every step Incorrect number of steps: 15  Total Walk and Turn Clues: 6of 8  One Leg Stand: I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Lopez. I asked Lopez if he understood the test, and he stated he did, he picked up his right foot to begin the test.  Seconds 1-10: Swayed from side to side. Put foot down at 9 second mark  Seconds 11-20 Swayed from side to side Put foot down at 11 second mark  Seconds 21-30 Swayed from side to side  Put foot down at 26 second mark  Total One Leg Stand Clues:2 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test    Preliminary breath test was offered to Lopez. Lopez submitted to the preliminary breath test with a result of .14 BrAC.  Arrest and Transport:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Lopez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence:  * Eyes blood shot and glassy * Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his vehicle * Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person *My observed signs of impairment during SFSTs.  At approximately 0409 hours, I placed Lopez under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I placed Lopez in the front passenger of my patrol vehicle. Upon placing Lopez in my patrol vehicle, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage in the vehicle that was not present prior to placing Lopez in the vehicle.   20-Minute Observation Period:  I transported Lopez to the MSP Salisbury barrack. The MVA DR-15 was read to Lopez in Spanish. Lopez agreed to submit to the intoximeter test. At 0433 hours, Lopez signed the DR-15 advice of rights. Cpl Bean, a certified intoximeter, administered the test at 0447 hours. Lopezs breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .11 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.Lopez was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was released to a sober driver. It should be noted that Lopez was polite and cooperative during the entire encounter. Lopez appeared to take the situation very seriously.  All events did occur in Wicomico County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
