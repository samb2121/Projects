         <NarrativeText>N-36 is equipped with a mobile recording device, and body worn camera operational. Defendant: Damonte Quamaine Atkinson 1/M Date of Birth: 12/10/1999 Date of Arrest: 02/20/2023 Time of Arrest: 0418 hours DUI #: 23-049  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING * Successfully completed six month Maryland State Police Academy (6/2020). * Trained and certified in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (4/2022)  AUDIO VISUAL RECORDING: MSP marked patrol vehicle N-36 is equipped with audio visual recording equipment. Body worn camera also equipped.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 20, 2023 at approximately 0402 hours, I, Trooper First Class Emerick #6888, was sitting stationary on northbound I-270 at the Skyramp cross over. I observed a gray Honda Civic traveling on northbound I-270 that was operating with no headlights on. I pulled out of the cross over and began to catch up to the Honda. I caught up to the vehicle northbound I-270 prior to Montrose Road, and the vehicle was still operating with no headlamps. The vehicle was traveling in lane 4. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on northbound I-270 prior to Wootton Parkway. As I activated my emergency equipment the Honda drifted from lane 4 to lane 3 by one tire width. The Honda then began to drift back into lane 4 and slow roll and eventually came to a stop on the right shoulder. The Honda Civic was bearing Maryland registration 7EE8059.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contactwith the driver and passenger of the Honda Civic. I advised the driver and passenger my name, ID number, agency I work for, that the stop was being audibly and visually recorded and the reason for the stop (driving with no headlights on). I immediately observed the drivers eyes to be glassy and his speech to be slurred. I also detected the odor of marijuana emanating from the Honda. In addition, when the driver spoke I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Damonte Quamaine Atkinson (1/M DOB 12/10/1999).  I then returned to my patrol vehicle and radioed to the Rockville Barrack to start another unit for field sobriety tests and a probable cause search. I also conducted an MVA check that revealed Atkinson had a valid Maryland drivers license. Once another unit arrived on scene, I deactivated my patrol vehicles forward facing emergency lights.   I asked Atkinson to step to the front of the vehicle he was operating, I then advised him that I wanted him to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, to which he consented.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of Northbound I-270 at Wootton Parkway. The surface was dry, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear, lighting conditions were dark with some streetlights above. I observed Atkinson to be in decent physical condition. I asked Atkinson how much he had to drink tonight, and he stated just a shot or two. Atkinson advised me that he took the shots approximately an hour prior.  I asked Atkinson the following questions:  Glasses or Contacts - Glasses. Medication - None. Medical Conditions - None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 clues observed)   The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my index finer was used as the stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Atkinsons eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Atkinsons pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking, and no resting nystagmus was observed.   1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes.   2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Not present.  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) Prior to Atkinson performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Atkinson was instructed to place his left foot on an imaginary line out in front of him with his right foot directly in front and touching heel to toe. Atkinson was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Atkinson was advised to take a series of nine (9) steps in a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. Atkinson was instructed to keep his hands down at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count each step out loud. Atkinson was explained and demonstrated that once he got to his ninth step he was to keep his lead foot planted on the line, and take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Atkinson was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Atkinson was instructed that once he began the yest he was to keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud, and to not stop until the yest is complete.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Starts too soon. 2.) Broke from starting position.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  Turn: Completed unsatisfactorily.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed)   Prior to Atkinson performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Atkinson was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while instructions were give. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, and so on) and to continue until told to stop. Atkinson was asked if he had any questions about the test to which he did not. Atkinson chose to raise his right foot.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: Seconds 11-20: 1.) Used arms for balance. 2.) Swayed from side to side. Seconds 21-30:  Preliminary Breath Test (PBT): While on scene, Atkinson submitted to a preliminary breath test. The results of the PBT were .09 BrAC.  Arrest: Based on the following, I had reason to believe that Atkinson was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. * Driving a motor vehicle at dark with no headlights on. *Driving behaviors when attempting to pull over to right shoulder. * Glassy eyes. * Odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath. *Admission of drinking. *Slurred speech. *Clues during SFSTs. *.09 BrAC PBT result. Atkinson was placed under arrest at approximately 0418 hours. A search of the Honda Civic was conducted, due to the odor of marijuana at approximately 0420 hours. The search yielded negative results. A preliminary search of Atkinson was conducted on scene. Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Atkinson with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Atkinson was also played the MVA recording of the DR-15 Advice of rights in English. Atkinson submitted to an evidentiary breath test. The results of the Intoximeter test were .12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Atkinson was charged with DUI and the related traffic citations. Atkinson was then released to a sober friend.  Case closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
