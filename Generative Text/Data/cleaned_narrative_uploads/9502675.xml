         <NarrativeText>Defendant: Bret Slaydon Artz Date of Birth:06/06/2001 Date of Arrest: 03/25/23  Time of Arrest: 0154 Hours DUI #: 23-034   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  *Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.)  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 03/25/23 at approximately 0147 hours I was on patrol in my unmarked MSP vehicle O-15. I was driving on southbound route 11 in the area of Springfield Lane when I observed a vehicle traveling northbound without any headlights or tail lights activated. I got behind the vehicle and activated my emergency equipment to initiate a traffic stop. The vehicle pulled to the right shoulder of northbound route 11 at I-81. Once stopped, I observed the vehicle to be a Grey Ford SUV bearing MD registration 7FE0215.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   I made a drivers side approach, identified myself, and informed the driver for the reason for the stop. Upon informing the driver of the reason for the stop he stated, Oh ok sorry and turned his lights on. Upon contact with the driver, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I observed the drivers eyes to be bloodshot, watery, and glassy. I identified the driver by his Maryland drivers license as Bret Artz. I asked Artz where he was coming from. Artz stated he was coming from Third Base. Third Base is a bar in the Williamsport area known to serve alcoholic beverages. I then asked Artz how much he had to drink. Artz stated, Just one. I asked Artz to exit and walk to the front of his vehicle and he agreed. At the front of his vehicle, I could now detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath. I again asked Artz if he only had the one drink and he shook his head yes. I asked Artz if he would perform SFST and he agreed.   I asked Artz the following:  Injuries- No  Glasses: Contact lenses and he was wearing them at the time  Pre-Arrest Screening (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of northbound route 11 at I-81. The surface was dry, and free from any obvious debris. All forward facing emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Artz appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injury.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues)   The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. My pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Artzs eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Artzs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. He was positioned in a manner to ensure passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Artz if he understood the instructions and he stated, Yes.       Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes      Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes        WALK AND TURN (2/8 Clues)   Prior to Artz performing the test I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Artz was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Artz was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until instructed to begin. Artz was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Artz was instructed to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Artz was explained and I demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and planted, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around to his left. Artz was again explained and I demonstrated a second series of nine (9) steps were to be completed identically to the first series. Artz was instructed that once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed. Keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. I asked Artz if he understood the test. Artz stated, Yes. Artz was instructed to begin the test.   Instructional Stage:      Lost balance 1 time     Walking Stage (1st nine):  Missed heel to toe  Walking Stage (2nd nine):  Missed heel to toe  Turn: Completed  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 Clues)   Prior to Artz performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be completed. Artz was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down at his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Artz if he understood the test and he stated, Yes. Artz began the test, lifting his right foot.   Balance and Count Stage:   Seconds 0-10  Swayed  Foot Down     Seconds 11-20  Swayed      Seconds 21-30  Swayed  Foot Down    Artz refused PBT.  ARREST   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Artz was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:     *Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving  *My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety testing  *Bloodshot eyes  *Watery eyes  *Driving without any lights on  I arrested Artz for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0154 hours and he was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. Once at the Maryland State Police Hagerstown Barrack, Artz was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to follow along with as the DR-15 advice of rights were read to him. At the conclusion of the DR-15 Artz agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same at approximately 0220 hours.   Intoximeter Results:  .08 BrAC  Artz was given copies of all pertinent paperwork and released to a sober adult.   Case Status:  I respectfully request this case be closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland </NarrativeText>
