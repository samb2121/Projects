         <NarrativeText>CASE #: 23-MSP-010503 SUSPECT: Riveron, Rene Almaguer (MD A-452-734-014470) VICTIM: Chavez Sanchez, Karen Iveth (MD C-152-461-347-497)  *THIS INCIDENT WAS RECORDED ON MY IN-CAR AND BODY WORN CAMERA SYSTEMS*  NARRATIVE:   On March 24, 2023 at approximately 0121 hours, I, Trooper Keller #7360 was on duty operating unmarked MSP patrol vehicle P-14. I responded to the area of northbound I-97 near Stewart Avenue for reports of a single vehicle collision. Upon my arrival at 0126 hours, I observed a white transit van off the right shoulder into the wood line and a white Chevrolet Equinox, bearing Maryland registration 7DM2116, stationary in lane five. While approaching the Chevrolet I observed a Hispanic male standing on the shoulder. The male stated that he was not involved in the accident and had stopped to check on the welfare of the driver. While advising the driver of the Chevrolet to pull his vehicle out of the roadway and onto the shoulder I observed a Hispanic female, later identified as Karen Iveth Chavez Sanchez (H/F DOB: 06/25/1990), sitting in the front passenger seat of the Chevrolet bleeding from her forehead and crying. After confirming that there were no injuries from the accident, assisting Troopers arrived to handle the separate accident scene.  I asked the male driver, identified as Rene Almaguer Riveron (H/M DOB: 06/19/1990) by his Maryland drivers license, why Sanchez was bleeding and injured and he hesitantly stated they were involved in an argument. After separating both parties, Riveron stated that he and Sanchez live together in Glen Burnie, have two children, and are engaged. I observed a small scratch on the right side of Riverons neck. Riveron stated that they were coming from a restaurant in Bowie, later found to be Ichiban Sushi, and on their way home when they began arguing. Riveron stated Sanchez reached over and pushed his face while he was driving. He then stated that he used his hand to try to push her away saying I may have hit her while pushing with his right hand multiple times to reenact the incident. Riveron stated then Sanchezs face began bleeding from her nose, eyes, and mouth. Riveron did not comment on the main cause of the argument but stated multiple times that I guess I hit her. I observed a small amount of dried blood on Riverons right hand. Riveron advised that the blood was from a small cut on his right thumb.  I made contact with Sanchez who was speaking with TFC White #6932 who was documenting her injuries. I observed a small open wound on the right side of Sanchezs forehead which was actively bleeding and appeared fresh. Sanchez had dried blood around her lips and blood visible on her white shirt. I observed swelling on her upper lip as well as bruising to her right cheek and eye socket. Sanchez stated that her and Riveron were in an argument just south of our location when he used his right hand to strike her in the face approximately five times causing the visible injuries. Sanchez provided concurrent information regarding their prior whereabouts adding that both parties had consumed alcohol while in Bowie. While speaking with Sanchez she was crying and visibly emotional. After initially stating that EMS was not needed, Sanchez decided that she would like to be evaluated due to head pain. Anne Arundel EMS personnel responded and evaluated Sanchez, but she refused further medical treatment. Images of both Sanchez and Riveron were collected on scene.  Riveron was placed under arrest at 0154 hours for second degree assault. Sanchez was provided with information on domestic violence protective services, completed a statement and lethality screening (MSP 246) in which she was deemed High Risk due to her statements to myself and TFC White, and spoke with representative Erika of the domestic violence hotline regarding the incident. Sanchez stated that physical arguments between her and Riveron have happened previously, but this is the first instance in which law enforcement has been involved and every time shes had to defend herself. Sanchez was provided a ride home by TFC White and the vehicle was secured on the shoulder.    Riveron was transported to the Jennifer Road Detention Center where a statement of charges was completed under tracking number 235559006513. Riveron was provided with a copy of the charges and documentation from the incident.   All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.    </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On March 25 2023, at approximately 1245 hours I, Trooper Keller #7360, was contacted by TFC Tenorio #6321 via email and provided with additional images of victim Karen Iveth Chavez Sanchez injuries. The images, taken by TFC Tenorio at Sanchezs Glen Burnie residence approximately 35 hours following the assault, have been attached to this report. The injuries to Sanchezs face depicted include swelling to the upper and lower lips, including bruising on the lower right lip as well as the center of the top lip. Sanchez has a Band-Aid covering a wound to the upper right side of her forehead and there is bruising on her left eye socket and eyelid. The injuries are consistent with what I observed on scene. TFC Tenorio advised that Sanchez was again asked if she was interested in completing paperwork on a Protection Order and she refused.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
