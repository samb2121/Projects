         <NarrativeText>The following incident was recorded via the front mounted AXON recording device on MSP marked vehicle G-9 and my MSP body worn camera.  Incident: TA 17-107: Knowingly Driving Uninsured Vehicle TA 16-101a1: Driving Without License  Date/Time Occurred: February 23rd, 2023 at approximately 1956 hours  Location: Westbound Maryland Route 26 at Hemlock Drive Sykesville, Maryland 21784  Attachments: -MVA Printout of Suspect -MVA Printout of Vehicle -Citations Issued to Suspect  Suspect/Driver: Mark Edward Wess DOB: 04/20/1957, W/M 6422 Bonnie Brae Road Sykesville, MD 21784  Scene Processing: No additional scene processing occurred in addition to the traffic stop.  Narrative: On February 23rd, 2023 at approximately 1956 hours, I, TFC Hollinger #6938 of the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack, was patrolling the area of Westbound Maryland Route 26 at Hemlock Drive in Sykesville, Carroll County, Maryland. I was operating MSP Marked Vehicle G-9 with its front mounted Axon recording device as well as my MSP issued body worn Axon camera. At this time, I observed a blue Honda CRV, later verified by its Maryland registration of 27747BY, traveling westbound in lane two. As I approached the vehicle, I observed the registration affixed to the vehicle displayed an expiration of June 2018. I conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle, which came to rest in the PNC Bank parking lot located at 1350 Liberty Road.    I made contact with the driver of the vehicle, advised them of my identity, and advised them that the traffic stop was being audibly and visually recorded. The driver handed me a Maryland drivers license, which expired in 2017. The driver was identified with the expired license as Mark Wess, DOB 04/20/1957. Also present in the vehicle was Mark Wess sister, Jean Wess. I advised Mark Wess the reason for the stop. Both Mark Wess and Jean Wess stated they knew the vehicle was expired, that neither of them had valid drivers licenses, and that the vehicle did not have insurance. I asked them why they were driving if all of those violations were occurring. They stated they needed basic living supplies. They then began to go into extensive details about their financial struggles. A METERs check confirmed Mark Wess had a surrendered license status and there was no record of a recent license for Jean Wess. METERs also confirmed the expiration year of 2018 and a suspension due to VEIP (Emissions.) All Verifications noted above were confirmed by the Westminster Barrack Communications Officer.    Due to the totality of the circumstances from the traffic stop, I requested a tow truck respond to the scene to remove the vehicle operated by Mark Wess. Road Rescue Towing arrived on scene and took possession of the vehicle. TFC Nield and I transported Mark Wess and Jean Wess to their residence at 6422 Bonnie Brae Road in Sykesville. I issued Mark Wess the attached citations, a notice of counsel, and explained to him the must-appear violations. I explained to Mark Wess he would be required to attend District Court when summoned by the court. Mark Wess stated he understood.  I request this case be closed.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
