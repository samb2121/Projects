         <NarrativeText>On Wednesday, October 4th, 2023 at approximately 1337 hours, I, TFC. Kline (#7112), was dispatched to 12415 National Pike, Frostburg, Garrett County, Maryland 21532, for an overdose. The caller, later identified as Kelly Jean Stein (2/F DOB; 06/08/1985), called 9-1-1 and advised her neighbor had overdosed, and administered NARCAN.  I arrived at scene at approximately 1345 hours and made contact with a male standing outside the residence in the front yard. The male was identified as Todd Christopher Shanklin (1/M DOB; 01/01/1966). Shanklin advised his neighbor called 9-1-1 for him (and mentioned he was ok). Shanklin said he was asleep in his bed and did not wake up to the sound of Steins voice. I asked Shanklin if Stein if he was experiencing an overdose, which he stated he was not and advised he was not a drug user. I asked Shanklin if Stein used narcan to wake him up, which he said she had not. Shanklin did say he was a diabetic, and takes daily medication for diabetes and for his hurt back. Shanklin said he takes Insulin for his sugar and energy, and Gabapentin for his nerve/back pain. Shanklin advised he took other medication as well but was not mentioned. Shanklin did say he drinks alcohol from time to time as well. Shanklin was agitated and annoyed the police were at his residence and he was not cooperating.  EMS 922 (RUN #2308423) arrived at the scene to check the nature of Shanklins health and well-being. Shanklins blood sugar was showing 489.A normal blood sugar range is between 80 and 120. Shanklin refused to go to the hospital to be seen by a doctor. At that time, Shanklin refused to sign the refusal paperwork for EMS personnel while on scene.  While speaking with Stein, she advised Shanklin was supposedly making pizzas in the oven for them both. After several minutes went by, Stein said she began to knock on the door and nobody answered. Stein said she went in the house and could not find Shanklin. Stein then said she noticed Shanklin laying in his bed asleep. Stein did say she tried to wake up Shanklin by using the sound of her voice, however, she was unable to gain his attention due to him being unconscious. Stein then said she narcaned him immediately. Stein said she called 9-1-1 and told the dispatchers she administered narcan to her neighbor. Stein then advised Shanklin woke up without issue. Stein began to not cooperate with me while I was asking her a series of questions regarding the incident. Stein mentioned she is a nurse practitioner for pain management but not practicing at this time. I asked her if she knew if Shanklin is a known drug user, which she did not give me an answer and told me to ask him myself. I asked Stein while she was in Shanklins house if she saw any drugs or anything out of the ordinary, she said she was not looking around at all and was more worried about her friend health. I asked Stein why she used narcan if she didnt know if he used drugs or not. She was unable to provide me an answer at that time.  While on scene, I did not see any drugs or illegal substances while speaking with all parties involved outside the residence. I did not make entry inside Shanklins residence while on scene.  Master Trooper D. Peterson (#5308), from the Maryland State Police Narcotics Task Force, was contacted on todays date and was advised of this incident.  I request this case to be closed due to no crime occurring.  All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
