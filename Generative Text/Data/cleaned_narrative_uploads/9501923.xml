         <NarrativeText>   Incident Captured on a Body Worn Camera https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=b67a98b1c4b94fd0920a1315a65318eepartner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1   Maryland State Police Salisbury E Incident: Domestic Dispute Location: 8419 Rum Ridge Road Delmar, MD 21875 Suspect: Harris Andrew English B/M DOB 10/07/1988 (443) 669-4601 Victim: Winter Ray Taylor W/F DOB 12/21/1982 (443) 497-0408  Narrative: On October 13, 2023, at approximately 0020 hours, I, TFC Johnson was dispatched to 8419 Rum Ridge Road Delmar, MD to investigate a domestic dispute.  Upon arrival, I met with the complainant who identified himself as Harris Andrew English {hereinafter referred to as English}. English gave the following account;  On this date and time, English and his ex-girlfriend Winter Rae Taylor {hereinafter referred to as Taylor} had been arguing off and on most of the night about Taylors whereabouts earlier that day. He and Taylor both own the residence however they had been living separately inside the home. English has his own room and so Taylor lives in the master bathroom. English got dressed to go to work and went into the master bedroom bathroom to brush his teeth. Taylor demanded he close the bathroom door while doing so.  Taylor was on the phone with her father talking about the previous arguments between her and English when she and English began to argue again. During the argument, they argued about Taylors son, Taylors childs father, Englishs credit debit and about their finances. Taylor called English racial names and told him to go back to Jamaica. Throughout the argument, Taylor demanded English leave her bedroom and English refused, stating that he owns have of home and doesnt have to go anywhere.  After the argument, English left the house to go to work. Upon arriving at the gas station, he realized he left his Blue tooth headset at the house. English returned to the house, retrieved his Blue tooth headset from his room and returned to Taylors room to talk to their pet dog that was laying in the bed with Taylor.  At this time, Taylor was on the phone with her mother and demanded English leave her bedroom. Again, English refused to leave stating the same reasons as previously mentioned. English finally left Taylors room and according to English, Taylor followed him into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed him in his right palm. English left the residence and contacted law enforcement for assistance.    English informed me Taylor had been drinking prior to the argument.  I did observe a laceration to Englishs right palm. The laceration was approximately 1 inch. His injury was captured on a body worn camera.English refused medical treatment.  After speaking to English, I interviewed Taylor. Taylor gave a similar account however Taylor denied any physical aspect of her and Englishs arguments. Taylor gave the following account: On this date, she was laying in bed and English came into her room and began to argue with her. Taylor immediately called her father because she did not trust Englishs behavior toward her. Taylor repeatedly demanded English leave her room, and he refused. Taylor begged her father to come to the home because English would not leave her bedroom. Taylor got up from the bed and went to English and continued to demand he leave her room. English wanted to argue about the joint ownership of the house, her son and her whereabouts after work. Taylor said English has his own room and for the past couple of weeks, they have been arguing consistently because he has been making comments about trying to get the house away from her.  English finally agreed to leave her room to go to work. Taylor laid back in her bed and went to sleep. She was awakened by her son, Mason Wesley Porch {hereinafter referred to as Porch} telling her that law enforcement was requesting to talk to her. Taylor had no knowledge of why law enforcement was at her home.  When I initially talked to Taylor I did not mention Englishs claim about the stabbing. Taylor was asked where the argument occurred, and she informed me the arguments occurred in her room and in the living room. When asked when she used the kitchen knives last, and she informed me she used them to cook the day prior, then washed them and put them away.    Englishs injury to his hand is not consistent with a stabbing with the tip of a knife.  I observed a silver handled Cuisinart brand knife with a 8 inch blade on the kitchen counter. There was suspected blood on the tip of the blade sitting on the kitchen counter. I did not observe any suspected blood on the counter or in the kitchen area. The knife was collected for further investigative processing if necessary.  I also noticed a 20 to 30-min time difference between the time English claims to have left the home and when he contacted law enforcement. According to Taylor, she assumed English left the house to go to work prior to our arrival.  I checked Taylors hands and did not observe any cuts or redness to her hands and while doing so, I told Taylor about Englishs claims against her. Taylor immediately became hysterical and denied any knowledge of English having any cuts on his hands or body prior to leaving the residence. Taylor confirmed she had been drinking prior to the arguments with English.  Taylor gave me verbal consent to talk her son, Porch. According to Porch he was in his room sleeping when he was awakened by yelling. Porch stated he did hear his mom yelling at English to get out of her room. He did not see anything because he did not leave his room.  Both English and Taylor completed written statements which are included in the case file.    Taylor did not have any cameras inside the home.  Photos of the knife were taken and uploaded into Veripic, a video storage system.    Based on the physical evidence and statements provided by English he was referred to the district court commissioner to complete charges against Taylor. Based on the above facts, and my years of experience as a Maryland State Trooper, I believe that the actions and demeanor of both English and Taylor are inconsistent with a domestic dispute involving a stabbing. The scene shows no blood on the kitchen counter, kitchen floor or any other area of the residence.    All of the above events occurred in Wicomico County Maryland.    Based on the facts of this case, I request this case remain open pending further investigation.        </NarrativeText>
