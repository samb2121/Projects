         <NarrativeText> M-13 Cameras Operable  - Defendant: Mario Aguilar De Los Santos - Defendant Date of Birth: 06/22/1982 - Time of Arrest: 0818 hours - DUI #: 23-006 - PBT: N/A -Intoxometer: Refusal  TRAINING  - Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) by the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). - Certified to operate and administer the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT).  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On Sunday January 15, 2023, at approximately 0807 hours, I, Trooper Gernatt #7248, was on routine patrol southbound Interstate 95 in the area of the 69 mile-marker. I observed a gray Nissan Altima, bearing Maryland registration: 3EG0416, that was making contact with the right jersey wall northbound Interstate 95 at the 68.6 mile-marker. I stopped to check the welfare of the operator.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  The gray Nissan Altima was in lane 5, making contact with the jersey wall. I made a passenger side approach on the vehicle and made contact with the operator, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. The operator of the gray Nissan Altima was later identified by his Maryland Drivers License as Drivers License as: Mario Aguilar De Los Santos. While I was at the passenger side window, I observed Aguilar De Los Santos to be sleeping. The vehicles engine was running (key less ignition). I then knocked on the passenger side window to wake up Aguilar De Los Santos. When Aguilar De Los Santos woke up, he put the vehicle in reverse and waved his right hand at me. Aguilar De Los Santos backed up the gray Nissan Altima and then pulled forward, creating space between the travel lane and the jersey wall. I observed scratch marks on the passenger side (see ACRS report in attachments). Aguilar De Los Santos then placed the gray Nissan Altima in park and exited the vehicle. I then observed a white Modelo open alcoholic beverage container in the cup holder of the center console.  I informed Aguilar De Los Santos that I wanted him to perform field sobriety tests, which he agreed to submit.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the right side of the jersey wall on Interstate 95 at the 68.6 mile-marker. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The lighting conditions were daylight. Aguilar De Los Santos appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, limps, or any limb ailments.  Aguilar De Los Santos offered no statements that would prevent him from walking and balancing.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 CLUES OBSERVED)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was the stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from his eyes. Aguilar De Los Santos was instructed to look at the stimulus while keeping his head still, and to follow the stimulus with only his eyes. Aguilar De Los Santos eyes were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed.  - Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees -Not present *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus - Not present*  WALK AND TURN (5/8 CLUES OBSERVED)  Prior to Aguilar De Los Santos performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Aguilar De Los Santos was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot, touching heel to toe. Aguilar De Los Santos was then instructed to remain in that position until told to begin. Aguilar De Los Santos was instructed to take nine (9) heel to toe steps in a straight line while looking down at his feet, counting out loud, while keeping his hands down at his sides. On the ninth step, he was instructed to complete a series of small steps around his lead foot to the left to completely turn around. Aguilar De Los Santos was again explained and demonstrated that the second series of nine (9) steps were to be completed in the exact same manner of the first series of steps. Aguilar De Los Santos was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, look down at his feet, count his steps out loud, while keeping his hands down at his sides. Aguilar De Los Santos immediately started the test. (Footwear: black sneakers)  Instructional Stage: - Starts too soon  Walking Stage (1st Nine): - Stops while walking - Incorrect numbers of steps  Turn: - Improper turn  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): -Does not touch heel-to-toe -Steps off-line -Incorrect number of steps  ONE LEG STAND (1/4 CLUES OBSERVED)  Prior to performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Aguilar De Los Santos was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down at his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, Aguilar De Los Santos was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While Aguilar De Los Santos leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and count out loud by the thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, one thousand-three, etc.) and to continue until told to stop. (Footwear: black sneakers).  Instructional Stage: N/A  Balance and Counting Stage: - Swaying  ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Aguilar De Los Santos was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  - Single vehicle collision - Vehicle parked in the travel lane (lane 5) - Aguilar De Los Santos sleeping in the driver seat while the engine was running. - Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Aguilar De Los Santos breath and person - An open can of Modelo in the cup holder of the center console - My observed signs of impairment as Aguilar De Los Santos preformed field sobriety tests  I arrested Aguilar De Los Santos at approximately 0818 hours for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Maryland State Police JFK Memorial Highway Barrack for processing. While in my patrol vehicle, I played the Spanish audio version of the DR-15 for Aguilar De Los Santos. Upon arrival at the barrack, I gave Aguilar De Los Santos a copy of the DR-15. Aguilar De Los Santos refused to submit to the Intoxometer Test.  Subsequently, Aguilar De Los Santos was given a ride to his residence and released to a family member with all appropriate documents.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
