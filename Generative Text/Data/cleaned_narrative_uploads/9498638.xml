Subsequent Offender: Yes DUI #23-58-129  Narrative:  On Monday, June 19, 2023, at approximately 0037 hours, I, TFC. Fisher #7274, was on routine uniform patrol operating MSP marked patrol vehicle I-41 in the area of 12961 Ridgely Rd, Greensboro, Caroline County, Maryland, conducting routine traffic enforcement.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On the date of the incident, the weather was clear with approximate temperature of 70 degrees. At this time, I was traveling southbound on Ridgely Rd just North of Holly Rd. I observed a vehicle traveling northbound on Ridgely Rd approaching my location that appeared to be traveling well above the speed limit (50 MPH). I activated my Kustom Golden Eagle II Radar Unit into forward front facing mode, and captured the vehicles speed at 102 MPH in a posted 50 MPH zone. The vehicle in question was the only vehicle in the direct line of sight of my radar unit. I am certified to use this radar unit, the unit was tested before and after my shift, found to be working properly. I made a U-turn never losing sight of the vehicle, eventually catching up to the vehicle in the area of 12961 Ridgely Rd, Greensboro, MD. I identified the vehicle as a Gray Chevrolet Silverado bearing MD registration 91676CK. I activated my emergency equipment conducting a traffic stop in the area of 12961 Ridgely Rd. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the driver and sole occupant, who was identified as Douglas Lisonbee Roden (DOB: 02/17/1979, 2/M) via his MD drivers license. While collecting Rodens drivers license and vehicle information Caroline County 911 Center dispatched a BOLO (Be On The Lookout) for Roden and his vehicle. Rodens wife contacted 911 stating Roden is intoxicated and driving erratically, excessing speeds of 100 MPH. I advised the MSP Easton Barrack I have the BOLO vehicle that was dispatched. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I observed Roden to have droopy bloodshot watery eyes, slow thick slurred speech, lack of coordination, slow movements, he was overly apologetic, and visibly upset.I question Roden about the events that transpired this evening and why his wife was contacting 911 concerned about his wellbeing. Roden advised he has had a tough two weeks dealing with relationship and infidelity issues with his wife. He stated he turned to alcohol to help cope and he has a drinking problem. Roden admitted he has consumed about 5-6 12 oz Corona beer bottles in a few hours while he was driving. I observed one (1) 12oz glass Corona Bottle in the driver door pocket next to Roden that was still cold to the touch.
