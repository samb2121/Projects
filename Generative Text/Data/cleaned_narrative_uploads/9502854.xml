         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>My Body Warn Camera was operational and recording this incident.   Neighborhood Check:  I contacted Zeb Rohrback, the owner at 1755 Manchester Road, Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland. Rohrback advised that he did not see anything that was out of the ordinary, however, he did hear some banging at approximately 5 a.m. but stated that he thought it may have been his neighbor. He also confirmed with his ring camera which was on the opposite side of the house facing away from the victims house the banging that he heard. He stated that there were no other cameras in the direction of the victims house.   Scene Processing:  I captured photos of the missing catalytic converter along with a photo of the truck itself.   Attachments: Photos of missing catalytic converter.   Victim: Harlod Bruce Shatzer, W/F, DOB: 07/10/1957 1763 Manchester Road, Westminster, Maryland 443-487-7310  Victim Statement: Shatzer advised that he got up that morning to go and help his neighbor with something on his farm. He advised that he got into his truck which was parked approximately 150 feet away from his house and started it. He stated once he started his truck that he noticed that it was unusually louder than normal. I advised that he shut the truck off and went to his neighbors house at 1755 Manchester Road and advised him what happened. He stated that his neighbor came over to his house and looked underneath of his truck. His neighbor told him that someone cut his catalytic converter off of his truck. Harlod then contacted the State Police.   Narrative: On March 18, 2023, at approximately 1130 hours, I, TFC Iman #6696 of the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack responded to 1763 Manchester Road, Carroll County, Maryland for the report of a theft of a catalytic converter.   Upon arriving at the residence, I made contact with the victim who identified by his name and date of birth as Harold Bruce Shatzer, W/M, DOB: 07/10/1957 and he made the above statement. I asked Shatzer how late did he stay up, and he stated that he doesnt sleep well and that he was up until approximately 3 a.m. Shatzer stated that during the time that he was still awake, he did not hear anything but did notice his security light popped on a few times throughout the night. He stated that he did not happen to look outside based off the fact that there are a lot of animals that roam around his property. I asked Shatzer if he had any type of security system installed or any type of ring cameras, and Shatzer stated that he does not have any security systems installed on is house. Shatzer stated that he had already made contact with his other neighbors to see if they saw or heard anything that morning. They advised that they did not and Shatzer also stated that they do not have a security system installed on their houses either. Shatzer stated that he would not have any idea who could have done this because he stays to himself and does not talk to anybody but his neighbors. There were no tire tracks leading up to Shatzers driveway. There were no fingerprints on the truck or footprints around the truck.   Due to the lack of suspect leads, I request this case be suspended.   All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On May 4, 2023, at approximately 0830 hours, I responded to Petrys junkyard located at 800 Gorsuch Road, Westminster, MD and made contact with the owner of Petrys, Thomas Petry, he advised that he does not buy catalytic converters from the public.  I then responded to Carroll Scrap Metal located at 3234 Baltimore Blvd, Finksburg, MD. I made contact with Donald Marsh an employee at Carroll Scrap Metal, and he stated that they do not buy catalytic converters from the public, however, he advised that he obtained a phone number from someone who stopped in to scrap metal, and they advised that a man by the name of Donnie will buy catalytic converters from people. I contacted Donnie via phone at 443-632-4774, and he advised that he has only bought two catalytic converters since the beginning of March and one was off of a Honda and the other was off a Subaru. Neither of those belonged to the victims vehicle in this specific case.  I also contacted Deckers Salvage West located at 3847 Littlestown Pike, Westminster, MD and spoke with the owner, Rebecca Werlinich. She stated that they will only purchase catalytic converters from people that have proof of a receipt stating that they made repairs to a catalytic converter. She also stated that they will purchase from a business with a proper business license. Other than those two options she advised they will not buy a catalytic converter from anyone else.  I request this case be closed due to lack of suspect leads and lack of evidence.</NarrativeText>
