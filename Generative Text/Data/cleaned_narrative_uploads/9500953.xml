         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> On May 22, 2023, Master Trooper Jeffrey Claycomb #0604 received a Handgun Qualification License (HQL) Revocation case for investigative follow-up. The subject of this investigation was identified as Gerron Brandon Hill, Black/Male, DOB: 06/08/2001 (22 years of age). Mr. Hill is currently prohibited from the possession of firearms and ammunition in the state of Maryland.   On 05/10/2023, the MSP Firearms Enforcement Unit (FEU) received a message notification from the MSP Firearms Registration Unit (FRU), which indicated Mr. Hill, while at the age of 15, had committed a crime, classified as a Felony Theft $1,000 to Under $10,000 in Howard County, MD on 02/20/2017. Following the incident, Hill was later found guilty of the theft and as a part of the ensuing final case disposition, he was classified as an Adjudicated Delinquent in the Juvenile Court for Howard County on 08/31/2017. This particular crime, if Mr. Hill had committed it as an adult, would have been both a state  federal prohibitor from the possession of firearms  ammunition, refer to Juvenile Complaint ID# 1717433 and Juvenile Petition ID# 13J1716860 for details. Mr. Hills HQL was officially revoked by the Licensing Division on 05/15/2023.  According to a query check of the 77R applications in the Licensing Portal, Mr. Hill had entered the Freestate Gun Range located in White Marsh, Maryland on 04/12/2023, and filed a Form 77R application to the Licensing Division-FRU, with the intent to purchase two (2) separate firearms identified as a:   Glock, Model 29 Gen 4, 10mm caliber, semiautomatic pistol bearing serial# BXSP788. Transaction Disposition: Not Released   margin-left:8px"&gt;Glock, Model 26 Gen 5, 9mm caliber, semiautomatic pistol, bearing serial# AHKA539. Transaction Disposition: Not Released   However, on 05/10/2023, the FRU marked Hills 77R application as Disapproved - Prohibited as a result of the state prohibitor listed above. This disapproval by the FRU prompted the initiation of this case for the FEU.   An investigative query was made into the Maryland Automated Firearms Services System (MAFSS), which revealed Mr. Hill has only one (1) regulated firearm currently registered to him in the system. The record also revealed Mr. Hill had previously filed a 77R application with JJ Armory, LLC located in Cockeysville, Maryland on 12/12/2022 in order to purchase a:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Century Arms International, Model VSKA Draco Series, 7.62mm x 39mm caliber, semiautomatic pistol, bearing serial# SV7P010040 with an approved transfer date of 12/20/2022, Current Disposition: Location is unknown.   The FRU marked this particular application Not Disapproved which subsequently allowed the transfer of this firearm to take place on 12/20/2022, despite the fact Mr. Hill had already been state prohibited since 08/31/2017.   A number of pre-investigative checks were conducted in order to dispel or confirm if Mr. Hill could still possibly be in possession of the missing firearm. A check of various firearm-related resources was utilized, which included ATF- eTrace, LInX, NCIC, and RAPID. The results of using these resources yielded negative results for the firearm(s) as having been reported lost, stolen, traced, pawned, or recovered by another agency. It is now presumed; Mr. Hill is in unlawful possession of the pistol.  On 05/31/2023, Sgt. David Feltman #0915, Corporal Michael Hegedus #4721, and I responded for a knock  talk investigation with Mr. Hill at his last known address located at 41 Mercury Court Baltimore, Maryland 21234. Upon knocking on the door, we made contact with the subjects mother identified as Ms. Leslie Renee Bromell, Black/Female, DOB: 12/31/1975, and explained our reason for being there. We inquired if her son, Gerron was available to speak with us concerning the investigation. Ms. Hill was hesitant to answer regarding his availability and stated she wasnt sure if Gerron was even there. We then explained our need to recover the firearm registered to her son. Ms. Bromell then closed the door and returned moments later with her sons unloaded pistol and surrendered the firearm to us. During the interview, Gerron Hill never came to the door to speak with us. Ms. Bromell appeared to be very guarded concerning her son. As a result, the visit was conducted entirely outside the residence.  After she surrendered the pistol to us, a close examination of the serial number was conducted, and was found to be a perfect match to the information contained in the MAFSS record.   Ms. Hill was provided with copies of the MSP Form 67 Chain of Custody Log, the MSP Form 78 Consent to Search  Seize, the MSP Form 203 Firearms Disposition Record, and a copy of the Disapproval Letter.    The seized firearm was later transported to MSP/CED Headquarters where it was packaged and processed in accordance with MSP policy and procedures. The recovered firearm was recorded and logged into evidence storage under Property Held Record number P333572.   As a result of the circumstances in this case, where an error occurred at the Licensing Division FRU level, it is in the best interests of the agency that no consideration for prosecution is sought against Mr. Hill in reference to this case. Therefore, I request this case be closed by exception.  Case closed by exception.   </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Firearm Return Supplement</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> On August 31, 2023, Master Trooper Jeffrey Claycomb #0604 received an email from Sgt. Dave Feltman #0915 indicating he had received correspondence from Mr. Gerron Brandon Hill who had provided documentation in the form of an Expungement Order and a Certificate of Compliance from the Circuit Court of Howard County. According to the Expungement Order, the case involving Mr. Hills previous juvenile prohibitor, (reference juvenile case# 13-J-17-016860) was expunged by the Honorable Administrative Judge, William Tucker on 06/28/2023. The Order of Compliance from the States Attorneys Office was signed and dated on 07/14/2023 indicating a full removal of his record. A subsequent cross-check of the Citrix Database further confirmed the removal of the Adjudicated Delinquency charge.   A prohibited persons check was conducted on Mr. Hill which revealed no recent adult prohibiting factors, which would prevent the lawful return of his firearm. However, a check of the NICS system continued to show Mr. Hill was still in a Denied status federally following the entry by the Licensing Division.   Later, Mr. Hill was contacted, and a mutually agreeable time was scheduled on this day to meet at the Golden Ring Barrack to return his firearm. At approximately 1100hrs on 08/31/2023, Mr. Hill and his mother arrived at the barrack and the firearm was successfully returned to Mr. Hill. All associated paperwork was completed and Mr. Hill was provided with a copy of the property receipt.   I respectfully request this case to be closed.  Case closed. </NarrativeText>
