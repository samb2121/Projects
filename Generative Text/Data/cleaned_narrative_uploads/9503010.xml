         <NarrativeText>Unmarked S-12 MSP Form 78 (Consent Search)      On 01/30/2023 at approximately 1928 hours, I, Trooper First Class Maranto #7116 of the Maryland State Police Centreville barrack was on patrol operating unmarked MSP vehicle S-12 traveling eastbound Route 50 in the area of Station Lane in lane 2. At that time, I observed a multicolored truck traveling in lane 3, with registration stickers showing a nine and 2020. I ran the vehicle through METERS and confirmed that the registration was indeed expired as of 09/2020. The vehicle was a multicolored Chevrolet Silverado bearing Maryland registration 2CM1104. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a lawful traffic stop on the vehicle eastbound Route 50 just prior to Nesbit Road.    I approached the drivers side of the vehicle, and advised the driver the reason for the stop. The drivers hands were excessively shaking. I asked him for his license and registration. A Maryland Drivers License positively identified him as Joshua Neuwiller (W/M DOB: 01/12/1977) of 506 College Drive, Queenstown, Maryland 21658. The driver told me he knew the registration was expired, and that he was trying to get the registration fixed. I could see in plain view a camouflage shotgun sitting on the passenger front seat to the passenger floorboard. I asked the driver if there was any other firearms in the vehicle, to which he told me No, I just came back from going hunting. Joshua also told me the shotgun was not loaded. I requested another unit respond to my location. I took the shotgun from the vehicle, and had the PCO run the drivers license and wanted check. In my vehicle while running the driver through METERS and using case search, I saw he had previous arrests for domestic violence, as well as numerous other criminal offenses. I was also advised that he may have an open warrant through the department of Natural Resources Police.    I asked Joshua if there were any other firearms in the vehicle, to which he told me No. I asked Joshua if I could search the vehicle, and he granted me permission to search the vehicle at 1937 hours. During the consent search of the vehicle, I opened the center console. Inside of the center console, was a white and yellow prescription pill bottle with the label removed. In black ink, Happy Birthday. was written on permanent marker. Inside of the bottle, was an unknown white powdery substance. At 1947 hours, I advised Joshua of his Miranda rights, and he waived his rights and wished to speak to me. I showed Joshua the bottle, and asked him what was in it. Joshua denied having any knowledge of what was inside of the bottle, and denied even knowing it was in the center console. Joshua began telling me that its his wife truck, and sometimes people put stuff in the truck. Joshua did not have an active warrant, and was not currently prohibited from owning a firearm I advised Joshua that if the substance comes back as a controlled substance, that he would be facing criminal charges.    I issued Joshua a citation for the expired registration plates, and placed his shotgun back in the truck. Joshua signed the consent to search form. If the substance comes back as a controlled dangerous substance, charges will be filed against Joshua.    I request this case be closed.    All events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
