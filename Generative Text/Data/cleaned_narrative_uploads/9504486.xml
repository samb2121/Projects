         <NarrativeText>**Axon Body Camera Footage is available for this incident**  Scene Processing: Reference the attached emails received from said victim, Kevin Paugh and scanned copies of investigative IP address information.   1. Screenshot of IMEI Numbers for New Devices   2. Order #1: US105835476   3. ATT Account Activation   4. Order #2: US361292550   5. IP Address Raw Data for Phone #1   6. IP Address Raw Data for Phone #2   7. Order #1 UPS Delivery Notification  Narrative: On 09/24/23 at approximately 1150 hours, I, TFC. Brittingham #6722, responded to 40685 Bishop Road, Mechanicsville, Maryland 20659 for the report of an online fraud. Upon my arrival, I made contact with the complainant, Kevin Robert Paugh. Mr. Paugh advised an unknown subject had purchased two Samsung cellphones under his Samsung account and under his name. Paugh advised the credit/debit cards used to purchase the cellphones did not belong to him and the addresses the phones were shipped to are addresses located in New Hampshire. Paugh stated he received an email from ATT on 09/15/23 at 0136 hours advising him to confirm his email address following recent account activity. Paugh stated he does not use ATT as his cellphone carries, he uses T-Mobile. Two minutes later at 0138 hours on 09/15/23, Paugh received another email from Samsung stating an order was received with an attached receipt and order number (US105835476). Paugh explained that he initially thought the emails he received were spam, given the fact that he had not recently made any purchases for the item listed via Samsung, and he did not have a cellphone carrier through ATT. After receiving multiple emails in reference to this order number, Paugh became suspicious and called Samsung directly to inquire about said order number. While speaking with a Samsung representative, Paugh was advised the emails he received were not legitimate and to ignore them.  Paugh continued to receive additional emails from Samsung and grew more suspicious, so he called Samsung a second time to express his concern. While speaking with a representative from Samsung for a second time, Paugh was advised the order number attached to his account was indeed legitimate, as well as the emails he received. Paugh advised the representative of the above information and the representative agreed the orders were fraudulent. Samsung then advised Paugh to notify law enforcement and obtain a police report in order to file a fraud claim through their fraud department.  On 09/22/23 at0050 hours, Paugh received another email from ATT advising him to finish the registration of the new account ending in 7247. On the 09/22/23 at 1541 hours, Paugh received an additional email from Samsung advising another order was received with an attached receipt with another order number (US361292550) for the same type/model cellphone as the first order made on 09/15/23. Again, Paugh advised he did not make this purchase, and he did not open any cellphone service through ATTs carrier service.  At this time, two Samsung cellphones have been purchased under Paughs Samsung account. Both are Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 256Gcellphones with a cost of $1,799.99 each. Both cellphones have been bought through Paughs account and under his name, however, the addresses attached to these purchases are shown to be sent to two separate addresses in New Hampshire. The first order is order number US105835476 with an address of 125 Dublin Road, Peterborough, New Hampshire 03458 showing as the shipping location. The first order was purchased with a VISA credit/debit card ending in 3948. The second order is order number US361292550 with an address of 456 Daniel Webster Highway, Merrimack, New Hampshire 03054 showing as the shipping location. This second order was purchased with a VISA credit/debit card ending in 8243. As of this moment, the first order has been delivered and picked up from its listed location in Peterborough, NH. The second order is still in transit to the Merrimack, NH location and has not yet been delivered.  Paugh advised he double-checked his cedit and debit cards to verify the numbers listed on these new orders did not belong to him, which he confirmed the card numbers do not match the ones listed on the orders. Paugh also googled the listed addresses to find that both addresses are CVS locations in New Hampshire. I confirmed this finding as well. Paugh was advised to check all bank statements/transactions to ensure no unfamiliar purchases have been made without his knowledge. He was also advised to update and change all passwords associated to his accounts, social media, banks, etc. Paugh was advised to activate any additional security/protection of his accounts if able. Paugh was also given the Maryland State Police Identity Theft Protection Quick Guide for additional resources to further protect his identity and assets. At this time, Paugh has not suffered any financial loss that he is aware of. It is unknown who the account holder is of the credit/debit card used to make the cellphone purchases.  On the morning of 09/25/23, I made contact with VISA via telephone to inquire about the two VISA credit/debit cards used to make the purchases of both cellphones. I was advised by the VISA representative that they would not be able to provide any information about a particular card without the full 16 digit card number or the full name of the person who is listed on the credit/debit card.  I then made contact with the manger, Jessica, of the CVS located at 125 Dublin Rd, Peterborough, NH 03458. Jessica advised her store is an access point for UPS. Jessica stated that packages are routed to CVS when citizens are not home to sign for their packages which require a signature. Once the package is dropped off at CVS, the citizen can then pick their package up from the CVS location by showing a form of identification or a proof of purchase, such as an invoice, etc. in order to verify the package owner/recipient. Jessica advised her store does not retain records of when packages are picked up or what form of verification is used during pick up of packages.  I also called and spoke with the manager, Crystal, of the CVS located at 456 Daniel Webster Hwy., Merrimack, NH 03054, who also verified that her store was an access point for UPS. Crystal advised the package in question has not yet been delivered to her store, but is showing an expected delivery for tomorrow, 09/26/23. Crystal advised the only form of verification used for package pick-up at her store is a picture ID. Crystal agreed to withhold the package from being picked up/retrieved by anyone coming into her store claiming to be Kevin Paugh. Crystal advised she would flag this package and notify her staff of this fraudulent incident. Crystal stated she would make an attempt to scan or photograph the form of identification used by the subject attempting to retrieve said package. In addition, Crystal advised she would retain video surveillance of the individual and their mode of transportation to assist with identifying a potential suspect for this case if/when they arrive to pick up said package.  I made contact with Samsung to possibly obtain the name associated with the credit/debit card used or to see if their representatives have access to view the full 16 digit card number. I spoke with 9 different Samsung representatives who were unable to assist with this investigation. Each representative advised they did not have access to the requested information, but would be able to transfer me to a department that would be able to. Each time I was transferred, I was never transferred to a representative that was able to assist me with the information I requested. Eventually, I was transferred to a company supervisor. The supervisor was able to provide two IP addresses corresponding with the purchases made for the cellphones. The first order (US105835476) has a corresponding IP address of 38.146.55.36, which traces back to a location in Boston, Massachusetts. The second order (US361292550) has a corresponding IP address of 87.249.134.229, which traces back to a location in Chicago, Illinois. From there, I searched the latitude and longitude associate with each IP address. Those coordinates also trace back to the Boston and Chicago area. When searching the coordinates for each location, I have not been able to pinpoint an exact location for those coordinates. Neither one provides a definitive location or business/residence. Using two different databases, I have gathered conflicting locations when inputting the coordinates. However, all databases still populate in the Boston and Chicago area.   On 09/26/23, I made contact with UPS costumer service who was able to confirm the package delivery for order #1. The representative advised the package was delivered and picked up from the CVS location on Thursday 09/21/23 at 1747 hours. The representative advised a photograph identification and tracking number are required for pick-up. Additionally, UPS advised an electronic signature was provided for the package. The customer service representative also emailed a copy of the delivery confirmation which has been attached to this report. I also inquired about the status of order #2, which I was advised as of 0900 hours, the package is currently out for delivery with an expected delivery between 1030 and 1330 hours today.  On 09/26/23, I also made contact with Samsung once more to obtain more information on who to specifically contact in order to obtain the credit/debit cardholder information as well as the full 16 digit credit/debit card number. I was advised by the Samsung representative that I would need to contact the Office of the President of Samsung to receive the authorization of the release of the requested information. I was provided with an email for said office and will be making contact with them to request this information.  I request this case remain open pending further investigation.  All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText> On 09/26/23 at approximately 1404 hours, I made contact with Crystal, the manager of the CVS in Merrimack, NH. via telephone call. Crystal stated the package in question had arrived to her store location sometime after 1100 hours today (09/26/23). Crystal advised a subject claiming to be Kevin Paugh came into her store to retrieve a package in Kevin Paughs name and produced a Massachusetts license which displayed the name, Kevin Paugh. Crystal advised the subject that the package had not yet arrived. As previous stated in the initial report, Crystal was aware of this investigation and knew to not give the package to this individual claiming to be Kevin Paugh. Crystal then told the subject to come back around 1600 hours when the UPS delivery driver usually comes to her store, stating that the package may arrive by then. Crystal was able to take a photograph of the Massachusetts licenses that the subject produced and also captured still-photographs of the suspect entering the store and attempting to pick up the package at the register (see attached). The Massachusetts license photograph matched the physical description of the person in the surveillance footage. After the suspect was advised the package had not yet arrived to the CVS store, the suspect became frustrated and aggravated because he had received confirmation that the package had indeed arrived. Crystal asked the suspect for his cellphone number so that she could call him when the package arrived, so he could return to pick it up. The suspect refused to give his cellphone number and then proceeded to leave the store. The suspect gave no indication that he would be returning or not. After receiving this update from Crystal, I advised her that I would make contact with the Merrimack Police Department to ask for further assistance given the fact this incident was occurring out of state.  I then called the Merrimack Police Department and spoke with Lieutenant Cassell. I briefed Lt. Cassell of this investigation and asked if he would be willing to assist with locating and identify the suspect involved. Lt. Cassell agreed and stated he would send his officers to the CVS to take possession of the package and attempt to locate or make contact with the suspect. I made contact with Crystal once more to update her on the new information and advised her to call Merrimack Police Department if she saw the suspect enter her store again. Moments later, Multiple covert units responded to the CVS to assist with this investigation. One Merrimack Police Officer responded to the CVS and immediately took possession of the package. Strategically placed covert units awaited the arrival of an individual fitting the description of the suspect to return and make entry into the store for a second time.   Later that evening, at approximately 2100 hours, I received a phone call from Sgt. Lambert #Z1/61 of the Merrimack Police Department advising the suspect was located and in their custody. The subject was arrested without incident and charged with the following (see attached reports and affidavit):     margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Identity Fraud (NH RSA 638:26,I(A)) *FELONY   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Manufacture/Possession of False ID (NH RSA 179:62,I(A)) *MISDEMEANOR   margin-left:16px"&gt;Attempted Theft by Deception $1,001- $1,500 (NH RSA 637:4)) *FELONY  It should be noted that the suspect was unwilling to speak with law enforcement and would only identify himself as Jose from the Bronx and Jose Luna. During the booking process, the suspect was identified by using fingerprint identification. The suspect was identified as Jose R. Luna Rodriguez of New York (see attached). It should be noted that Rodriquez matches the suspect in the surveillance still-photographs from earlier in the day and the person pictured in the Massachusetts license photograph. Rodriguez was later released from jail on 09/27/23 at approximately 0000 hours.   The victim of this incident, Kevin Paugh, was updated on the above events. Mr. Paugh also advised he wanted his personal information to be entered into NCIC as part of the FBIs Identity Theft File. Mr. Paugh advised he would respond to the Leonardtown Barrack to complete the necessary documentation for the NCIC entry.  At this time, I request this case remain open pending further investigation and application of charges being issued for Jose R. Luna Rodriguez.  All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 10/18/23, a subpoena request was made for the credit/debit card information used to make the cellphone purchases through the victims Samsung account. (See attached documents)  On 10/19/23, I received an email from Mr. Paugh advising he received an email from ATT with a possible phone number associated with one of the fraudulently purchased cellphones. The email from ATT stated The wireless number 6038081536 is no longer associated with user ID paughk@gmail.com. (see attached document)  On 10/21/23 at approximately 1545 hours, I spoke with the manager, Jessica, of the CVS location in Peterborough, NH. I requested the video surveillance footage from the store of the first package being picked up on 09/21/23 at 1747 hours. Jessica advised she would notify her asset protection representative to have this footage released to me to further assist with this investigation. This information would further identify who retrieved the first fraudulent package pertaining to this case. This information could potentially identify another suspect in this case or again, Mr. Rodriguez. Jessica was able to advise over the phone that the package appears to be picked up by a potential shorter hispanic male. This description fits the characteristics of Jose R. Luna Rodriguez.  On 10/22/23 an application for statement of charges was filed for Jose R. Luna Rodriguez. (See attached documents)  All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>The Asset Protection Leader for the CVS location in Peterborough, NH was able to provide surveillance footage of the first cellphone order (US105835476) being picked up from the CVS location. The package was picked up from the CVS on 09/21/23 at 1747 hours. The subject retrieving the package matches the description of Jose R. Luna Rodriguez. The footage shows the suspect electronically signing for the package and walking away from the service counter with the package in hand. The provided surveillance footage has been copied onto a hard disk and will be retained with the original case file.  A felony arrest warrant has been issued for Jose R. Luna Rodriquez who resides in Bronx, New York.  I request this case be suspended, pending service of said warrant. The extradition limits are 250 miles. The Maryland State Police North East barrack is 153 miles from Rodriguezs listed address in New York. However, I have no knowledge of this being a current address for which Rodriguez resides.  All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #4 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  As of 12/15/23, it has been decided by the St. Marys County State Attorneys Office that this case will be dismissed and the associated warrant will be rescinded. New Hampshire is prosecuting the suspect for the same charges, and we are prohibited by double jeopardy from prosecuting him for the same crimes here in Maryland. Additionally, witnesses which reside in New Hampshire would be required to attend court in this county if Maryland were to prosecute the suspect here. This is not an ideal venue for New Hampshire witnesses to attend trial as it would require them to travel to Maryland on their own funding. New Hampshire is the more preferred jurisdiction based on the witnesses state of residency. The St. Marys County States Attorneys Office supports New Hampshire with charging the offender.    On 12/17/23, I made contact with Mr. Paugh to notify him of this update for his case.  I request this case now be closed. All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
