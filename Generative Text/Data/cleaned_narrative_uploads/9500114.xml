         <NarrativeText>Attachments  -NCMEC Cybertip #167022069    Narrative  On 7/20/23, the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Section /Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force received NCMEC CyberTip # 167022069. The Cyber Tip, generated by Instagram, indicated that a subject uploaded child pornography to the internet. The CyberTip was assigned to Senior Trooper Theodore Cooke #6272 for investigation.    The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the suspect:    Name: 720 Phone: +12404315251 Date of Birth: 03-25-1974 Approximate Age: 49 Email Address: see4goon@gmail.com (Verified) Email Address: kyreeshyllon92@gmail.com Screen/User Name: kai7evyn ESP User ID: 52990211746 IP Address: 71.178.218.74 (Login) 07-21-2023 02:48:30 UTC Prior CT Reports: 165220990 ESP Group Identifier  possible involvement in online group related to CSE: 1088034709262635 Estimated Location: US at 07-24-2023 02:41:20 UTC (Not Verified)     The CyberTip contained 1 reported child pornography file. S/T Cooke reviewed the reported child pornography file and determined that it constitutes child pornography as it is defined under Maryland law. The file is described below:    Filename:DpReP2OtRCQc5mXc361118650_6541961859193345_3551376838251141490_n.mp4  Description: 29 second video file showing a black male and female laying on a bed. The male is vaginally penetrating the female with his penis. Both subjects are reasonably believed to be between 12 - 14 years of age based on their physical development and slight presence of pubic hair.    The Cybertip provided the following additional information regarding the chat messages sent immediately preceding and following the contraband video:  Info from file: Sent in product: Instagram Direct Files unique ESP Identifier: 248577527993175 Messenger Thread Name: luldan2x Messenger Thread ID: 1088034709262635 The following messages were sent immediately preceding and following the uploaded CEI: (July 21, 2023 at 02:38:43 UTC) 52990211746: I found yu (July 21, 2023 at 02:39:01 UTC) 8894301090: ?

S/T Cooke conducted a query of the upload IP address through an open-source database and determined that it is registered through Verizon Fios and geo-locates generally to the Bowie area of Prince Georges County, Maryland.   The suspect identifiers deconflicted with two past cybertip reports which did not contain child pornography. They are listed as follows: }br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;  2023-00088026 ( }br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;  2/28/23) }br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;  2023-00309157 ( }br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;  6/26/23)   Based upon the chat messages sent between the sender and recipient included within the Cybertip, it is inferred that the file was sent for comedic/shock value.  This Cybertip is administratively documented and closed pending additional information.   Case Status  ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE </NarrativeText>
