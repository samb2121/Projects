Narrative   My assigned department patrol vehicle, G-40, has a MVR equipped and was not recording at the time of the incident. My department issued BWC was operational and recording at the time of the incident.    On 02/11/2023, at approximately 1754 hours, I responded to 6710 Main Street, Sykesville, MD 21784 (Segue 1) for the report of a missing person.    I arrived on scene and spoke with the complainant, identified through her name and date of birth asSamantha Mills (2F DOB 05/24/1994). Mills stated she overlooks a female namedQuadojah Monet Erick Adams (1F DOB 07/02/1999) and she last saw her on 02/11/2023 walking out the front door at approximately 1530 hours. Mills stated her patients can walk outside and exit the building, but they need to report where they are going prior to exiting the facility. Mills stated Adams was wearing a black oversized coat, ripped jeans, purple/red wig with bangs, black boot and a backpack.Mills stated Adams was on conditional release. After collecting Adamss information, a BOLO was broadcasted to surrounding agencies. A phone number was collected through Adamss file, which was Adamss mother, Mary Adams. Westminster Barrack made contact with Mary Adams, and advised that she was out of town, and has not heard from her daughter. I also spoke with Mills supervisor, Tinia Smith, who was provided with the case number, and she provided me with the on-call phone number.    On 02/11/2023 at approximately 2034 hours, Westminster Barrack received a call from Segue 1 advising that Adams returned to the facility. I was advised that TFC. Mills from the Westminster Barrack responded to the location in which he confirmed that Adams returned (see supplemental report).    Due to the above stated facts, I request this case closed.

         <NarrativeText>On February 11, 2023, at approximately 2034 hours, I, Trooper First Class Mills #6784, was dispatched to 6710 Main Street, Sykesville, Carroll County, Maryland, to make contact with Quadojah Adams (DOB 07/02/1999 B/F), who was recently reported missing. Once I arrived on the scene, I contacted Adams in the dining room of Segue one (1), where I conducted a follow-up interview with her. While speaking with Adams, she advised that she had been at the facility for one week, and she was unaware that she could not leave, and it was her understanding that she just had to be back around 2000 hours. Adams added that she left the facility at 1530 hours to go to Wawa to get something to eat. At approximately 1700 hours, Adams advised that she left Wawa and walked back to the facility where she sat at the gazebo and smoked a few cigarettes. She also added that she walked around the outside of the facility with Idris, a male from Segue two (2). She stated that both of them stayed in the area of the facility for the remainder of the time, and she walked inside the facility at approximately 2000 hours. I asked Adams if during her departure she was hurt or abused to which she denied. Adams also stated that Idris was just a friend, and they were not in a relationship. Adams advised that her phone number was 410-571-4309, and it was a government phone.  The above facts were relayed to an employee of Sheppard Pratt.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
