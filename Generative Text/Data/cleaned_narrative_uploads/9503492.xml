Defendant: Marlon Antonio Marquez-Parada  Date of Birth: 10/19/1998  Date of Arrest: 03/05/2023  Time of Arrest: 0009 hours  DC License #: 4634083  DUI #: 23-070    TRAINING/CERTIFICATES         Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on December 5th-8th, 2022.      Trained in administering Preliminary Breath Tests through the Maryland State Police Forensics Science Division on December 9, 2022.       Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1):    On 03/04/2023 at approximately 0045 hours, I, Trooper Stacey #7390, was operating marked MSP vehicle L-35 and was traveling southbound on I-495 n/o Richie Marlboro Road, in Prince Georges County, MD. At this time I observed a black Ford Escape bearing DC registration JC5144, traveling in lane #4 and the operator was using a handheld device while the vehicle was in motion. I got behind the vehicle and activated my emergency equipment. It should be noted that it took the driver a prolonged time to pull over.    Personal Contact (Phase 2):    Upon my drivers side approach I made contact with the driver, whom I later identified as Marlon Antonio Marquez-Parada (H/M, DOB 10/19/1998). I immediately detected a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I observed a black bag in the passenger seat with a 6-pack of glass bottles inside. At this time I went to the passenger side of the vehicle to further investigate. Once I was on the passenger side, I observed one opened glass bottle of an alcoholic beverage on the passenger side floorboard. It was sitting upright and appeared to have been spilled recently. When I asked Marquez-Parada how many alcoholic beverages he that night he said he had nothing to drink. I then asked Marquez-Parada to exit the vehicle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Once Marquez-Parada exited the vehicle, I detected a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. At this time, I also noticed his eyes to be glassy and bloodshot.    Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3):  The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of the highway. The weather was clear and cold, approximately 40 degrees. Lighting conditions were dark. The ground was level and free of any debris. My patrol vehicles overhead emergency lights in the front were deactivated prior to field sobriety tests as well as the vehicles spot light. Marquez-Parada appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injuries as a result of the collision.   I asked Marquez Parada the following questions:    Medication: none  Medical Conditions: Asthma    Marquez Parada was asked to remove his glasses for the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)    The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from his eyes. Marquez-Parada was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Marquez-Parada pupils were of equal size and showed equal tracking.   Marquez-Parada displayed the following clues:        Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes      Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes         WALK AND TURN TEST (3/8 clues observed)    Prior toMarquez-Parada taking the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted.Marquez-Parada was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary line.Marquez-Parada was instructed and demonstrated to place hishands flat at hissides and to remain in that position until told to begin.Marquez-Paradawas advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Marquez-Paradawas instructed to keep hishands flat at hissides, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step,Marquez-Parada was explained and demonstrated to keep hislead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with hisrear foot to the left to turn completely around.Marquez-Paradawas again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series.Marquez-Paradawas instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hisside, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud.    Instructional Stage:        Cannot keep balance during instruction       Walking Stage (1st set of nine steps):        Does not touch heel to toe      Improper turn       Walking Stage (2nd set of nine steps):        Does not touch heel to toe      Improper turn           ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed)    Prior to Marquez-Parada performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to stand with his feettogether and hands down by his side while the instructions were given. During the test he was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start once the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop.
