         <NarrativeText>*Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack*  Vehicle: Marked Ford Explorer B-17  Body Camera Equipped and Functioning: Yes  In-car Camera Equipped and Functioning: Yes   OFFICERS ON SCENE: TFC Rickard (In-car camera and body worn camera)   Defendant: Steven Richard Stein Date of Birth: 02/25/1995 MD DL: MD-10272878702 Date of Arrest: 04/02/2023 Time of Arrest: 0330  ***Repeat Offender***  TRAINING/CERTIFICATIONS:  I am trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):  On April 2nd, 2023 at approximately 0310 hours I, TFC J. Rickard #6942, was on routine patrol in Maryland State Police marked Ford Explorer B-17 in the area of northbound I-270 and I-70 when I observed a red Honda Fit displaying Maryland registration 2EX7208 traveling in lane two at, what appeared to be, above the posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour. I paced the vehicle for approximately one mile at speeds between 68 and 71 miles per hour, in my Maryland State Police Ford Explorer which has been calibrated for speed. I also observed the Honda Fit drift over the solid white fog line into the gore area between northbound I-270 the merge lane from MD-85 by half a car width. As I continued to follow the Honda Fit northbound on I-270 onto northbound US-15, I observed the Honda cross the solid white fog line onto the right shoulder by more than a tire width on two more occasions. The Honda Fit then abruptly slowed down to approximately 40 miles per hour as it approached the exit for Jefferson Street. It was at this time that I initiated my emergency equipment and made a traffic stop on the Honda.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  I approached the Honda on the driver side and made contact with the male operator and only occupant. I requested his Drivers License and registration and informed him of the reason for the stop. I identified the driver by his Maryland drivers license as Steven Richard Stein (W/M DOB: 02/25/1995). While talking to the driver, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle as well as observing his movements to be slow and uncoordinated and his speech to be slow and slurred. When asked about the consumption of alcohol, Stein advised that he was heading home from work in Tysons Corner and had not had anything to drink. While communicating with Stein he would not look up and make eye contact with me, however I noticed his face flushed and clothing appeared to be disheveled.  When I returned to my patrol vehicle for standard METERS/NCIC checks of the operator and vehicle, I was notified that Stein has a J restriction meaning any vehicle he is operating was to have the ignition interlock device, which the Honda Fit did not.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  I requested Stein to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he agreed to. I then began talking to him in front of his vehicle prior to testing and started to smell an even stronger odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath/person, as well as his eyes watery and bloodshot. When asked again about the consumption of any alcoholic beverages, Stein stated he had nothing to drink.  The tests were performed on the right shoulder of northbound US-15 south of Jefferson Street on the right shoulder. The surface was dry, level, and clear from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of the patrol vehicles headlights, flashlight, and the streetlights. The patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all tests. Stein appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any physical injuries. I asked him the following questions:  Physical Injuries: None. Medical Conditions: None. Medications: None. Glasses and/or Contacts: None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed):  The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.  Stein had equal pupil size and equal tracking with no resting nystagmus.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation: Present in both eyes. Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees: Not present.  Stein also displayed vertical gaze nystagmus, which would be indicative of an extremely high blood alcohol content.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed):  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Stein stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.   Instructional Stage:  Lost balance (1 time)  Walking Stage (1st Nine):  1. Missed heel to toe by more than in inch on every step. 2. Stepped off-line on every other step. 3. Raised arms from side by more than 6 inches for balance (steps 1 through 7)  Turn:  Completed unsatisfactorily  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  1. Missed heel to toe by more than in inch on every step. 2. Stepped off-line on every other step. 3. Momentarily stopped walking to regain balance after turn    ONE LEG STAND (4/4 clues observed):  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Stein stated he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Balance and Count Stage:  No observations.   Seconds 01-10:  1. Raised arms from side by more than six inches for balance. 3. Swaying from side to side. 3. Foot hit the ground multiple times.  Stein nearly fell over in the first ten seconds. Apologized to me because he just got off work.   Seconds 11-20:  1. Raised arms from side by more than six inches for balance. 3. Swaying from side to side. 3. Foot hit the ground multiple times. 4. Began hopping.  Seconds 21-30:  1. Raised arms from side by more than six inches for balance. 3. Swaying from side to side. 3. Foot hit the ground multiple times.    Preliminary Breath Test (PBT):  Stein was offered a preliminary breath test which he refused to take.  ARREST:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Stein was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  *Exceeding the posted speed limit. Drifting over the fog line onto the right shoulder on multiple occasions. Abruptly slowing to well under the speed limit.  *Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from breath and person. *Eyes bloodshot, watery, and glassy. *My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.  While speaking with Stein he was curious as to why I made a traffic stop, which I informed him for exceeding the speed limit. Stein advised me that he sets his cruise control and had forgotten to reduce his speed where the speed limit changes from 65 miles per hour to 55 miles per hour.  Stein pleaded with him to let him go and not charge him for the DUI. Asking if I could just drop him off at home instead. Stein advised me that he had multiple DUIs and asked if I thought he would do any time in jail for this one.  Stein was placed under arrest at approximately 0330 hours. A preliminary search of Stein was conducted on scene. Prior to being placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle, per Maryland State Police policy. I provided Stein with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights and read it to him in English. Stein acknowledged that he understood what I had read to him. At approximately 0345 hours on April 2nd, 2023, Stein agreed to provide an evidentiary sample of breath. Stein was transported to the Frederick City Police Department Headquarters for processing.   20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:  A preliminary search was conducted on scene, and it revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. There was a certified breath tech, CPL T. Deatrich of the Frederick City Police, available to operate the certified instrument.  While awaiting the test Stein inquired as to how long the suspension would be if he refused the test, which I informed him as a subsequent offender his suspension would be an automatic two years. Stein once again agreed to the test, but informed us that it was not going to be a good one.  The test was conducted by CPL T. Deatrich of the Frederick City Police on a certified instrument. Stein had a result of 0.31 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0356 hours, on April 2nd, 2023.  INTOXIMETER RESULT:  ****.31****  Stein was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to a sober family member at his residence. Stein was polite and cooperative during the entire encounter and very apologetic.  All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
