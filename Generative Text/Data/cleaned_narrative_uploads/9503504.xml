         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police - Easton Barrack (I), Marked Patrol Vehicle I-59 which is equipped with a mobile recording device.   Defendant: Ralph Edouard   Date of Birth: 11/03/1985  Date of Arrest: 03/06/2023  Time of Arrest: 0247  CT SDX: 119252627   Troopers Training/Experience:      Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Eastern Shore Criminal Justice Academy, the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.      Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Centreville Police Department and the Maryland State Police.      Certified in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) through the Eastern Shore Criminal Justice Academy.      Certified Field Training Officer      Caroline County Deputy for four years and six months, reaching the rank of Deputy First Class.      Maryland State Trooper for 7 months.      Phase 1: Vehicle in Motion   On Monday, March 6, 2023, at approximately 0217 hours, I, Trooper C. Cooper #7501, was on scene of a single vehicle crash in the area of eastbound Route 50 at Bolingbroke Lane, Trappe, Talbot County, Maryland 21673.   While on scene of the crash, I was contacted via radio by Cpl. Moore in reference to a vehicle stopped in traffic with the operator appearing to be asleep. Cpl. Moore requested that I go make contact with the operator to ensure that he was OK. Cpl. Moore described the vehicle to be a red Dodge minivan with the operator being an African American male.   I began to approach the vehicle and identified it as a red 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan, red in color, displaying Virginia registration 9763XF. As I began to get closer to the vehicle, I observed the operator resting his head against the drivers side window.   Phase 2: Personal Contact   I then knocked on the window in order to make contact with the operator of the vehicle. The operator attempted to roll down the window but realized that the vehicle had stopped running because the ignition key had been turned to the idle position where it runs off the battery for a certain amount of time. The operator then turned the vehicle on and rolled down the window to speak with me.  As the window rolled down I detected the odor of marijuana emanating from within the vehicle. I requested that the operator provide me with his drivers license. As the operator looked back and forth across the vehicle and began to move items I observed that his movements were slow and lethargic. The operator ultimately provided me with this license and was identified as Ralph Eduoard.   I began to ask Ralph where he was coming from and going to. Ralph stated that he was coming from Baltimore and had left there at approximately midnight. I inquired on where Ralph was traveling to and he stated Crisfield, Maryland. As I continued to speak with Ralph I observed his speech to also be slow and lethargic, along with bloodshot eyes. Ralph stated that he was trying to sleep because he had been driving for a long time. I then revisited my previously asked questions on where he was coming from and going to. Ralph stated that he left Crisfield at approximately 1700-1800 hours on Sunday, March 5, 2023 to go to Baltimore. I asked Ralph again where he was coming from and he stated Popeyes.   Once TFC. Hansley, arrived on scene, I requested that Ralph exit the vehicle in order for me to conduct a probable cause search of the vehicle. Ralph inquired on why he was being asked to exit the vehicle and I advised him due to the odor of marijauna and the suspicion of possibly operating a vehicle while under the influence.   Ralph exited the vehicle and his wife, identified as Gertide Eduoard, did as well. It should be noted that there was also a 7 month old infant within the vehicle who was not properly restrained. The infant was within an infant seat, but was not strapped in and there were several blankets underneath and overtop of the infant. I did not observe the infant carrier to have a base properly strapped into the seat as well.   I then conducted a probable cause search of the vehicle. At the completion of the probable cause search, I located 1.5 grams of marijuana within Gertides purse. Gertide was ultimately cited and released from the scene. The evidence was identified as a controlled dangerous substance through my training, knowledge and experience. All evidence was transported back to the barrack where it was packaged and stored according to policy and procedure.   After the probable cause search I then advised Ralph that I needed him to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) and he agreed.   Phase 3: Pre-Arrest Screening   The evaluation was performed on flat level ground which was free of debris. It was approximately 40 degrees and dark. Ralph was wearing black jeans, a t-shirt, zip-up jacket and Hey-Dude style shoes. I asked Ralph the following questions:   Medical Conditions - Ralph stated he had none.  Injuries - Ralph stated he had none.   The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. The tip of my finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Ralphs eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. His pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. Ralph was asked if he understood the test and the instruction to which he stated, Yes.   Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Not observed.  Vertical Nystagmus - Not observed.   Walk and Turn (6/8 Clues):   Prior to Ralph performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Ralph was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and remain in that position until told to begin. He was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. He was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Ralph was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, take a series of small steps to turn around and completely turn around. Ralph was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. He was instructed that once she began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. Ralph was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he states, Yes.   Instructional Stage:   Ralph did not remain in the instructional position and began the test prior to being told to do so.   Walking Stage (1st Nine):   Ralph missed heel to toe, stepped offline, and raised his arms for balance during the first nine steps. Ralph also took the improper amount of steps and stopped after his seventh and eighth step and continued to ask for further instruction on what to do. Ralph ultimately stopped completing the test.   Turn:   Was not completed.   Walking Stage (2nd Nine):   Was not completed.   One Leg Stand (3 / 4 Clues):   Prior to Ralph performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. He was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice (right foot), off the ground approximately six (6) inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. He was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.   While completing the test Ralph placed his foot down, swayed and raised his arms for balance on multiple occasions within the first 10 seconds. Ralph at one point switched from raising his left foot to raising his right foot without being told to do so. Ralph stopped completing the test and complained about it being too cold outside. I advised Ralph to zip up his jacket and he responded by stating his jacket was not good enough. I provided Ralph with one more opportunity to complete the one leg stand and the same clues as previously stated were observed the second time.   Preliminary Breath Test (PBT): .00   Arrest:   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Ralph was driving a motor vehicle under the influence:      Bloodshot, glassy eyes.      Slurred, lethargic speech.      Clues during field sobriety.      Due to the observations, I concluded that Ralph was driving while impaired by a possible controlled dangerous substance. At approximately 0247 hours, on Monday, March 6, 2023, I placed Ralph under arrest and placed him in the front seat of my patrol vehicle per department policy. While on scene Ralph was provided with a copy of the DR-15 and advised to follow along while the audio version was played. At the completion of the recording Ralph agreed to take the test at approximately 0306 hours.   I then transported Ralph to the Maryland State Police - Easton Barrack I. Once at the Barrack, Cpl. Moore conducted the intoximeter test and later advised me that Ralph provided a breath sample which concluded a .00. I then contacted TFC. Cambra who is a certified Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) to see if he conducts an evaluation of Ralph. TFC. Cambra responded to the barrack for the evaluation.   Once TFC. Cambra was at the barrack, I advised Ralph of his Miranda rights. Ralph agreed to speak with TFC. Cambra and myself. TFC. Cambra requested that Ralph conduct a test for his evaluation and Ralph agreed. At the completion of the evaluation, TFC. Cambra explained to Ralph that he had concluded Ralph was under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance and requested that he submit to a blood draw. Ralph agreed. (See TFC. Cambras supplemental report for further information.)   I then transported Ralph to the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health - Easton. Once at the hospital, contact was made with a nurse on staff in the emergency room, Krista Wooters. Krista completed the blood draw at approximately 0641 hours. All vials containing Ralphs blood were packaged according to policy and procedure and later placed in the mail to be sent to the Chemical Test Unit. Ralph was then released from the hospital with all charging documents and other related documents from the hospital.   All events occurred in Talbot County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

The driver was identified as Ralph Edouard (DOB: 11/03/1985). Trooper Cooper advised me that he came in contact with Edouard after another unit observed him to be asleep against the window of his vehicle while traffic was stopped for a collision further down the road on East Bound Ocean Gateway, prior to the Malkus Bridge.  Trooper Cooper stated that he observed Edouard to be asleep against the window upon his arrival. After gaining Edouards attention, Edouard lowered the window. An odor of marijuana was detected emanating from the vehicle. A probable cause search of the vehicle was conducted which resulted in the recovery of suspected cannabis. Trooper Cooper advised clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Tests were HGN (4/6), WAT (6/8), OLS (3/4).

         <NarrativeText>  On Monday, August 22, 2023, I was contacted by Sgt. C. Del Vecchio in reference to this case.    Sgt. C. Del Vecchio provided me with the blood kit results which had no controlled dangerous substances detected. Contact was made with the Talbot County States Attorney Office who advised that due to there being no substances detected they would nolle prosequi the charges.    I request this case be closed due to the lack of prosecution from the SAO.  </NarrativeText>
