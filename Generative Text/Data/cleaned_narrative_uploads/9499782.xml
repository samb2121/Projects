         <NarrativeText>THE INCIDENT WAS NOT AUDIBLY OR VISUALLY RECORDED. Attachments: Photographs Victim: State of Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA)  Gaithersburg Shop Stolen Item: One deep cycle battery. Value of $366 Location: 502 Quince Orchard Road Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878 Neighborhood Check: A neighborhood check and check of local businesses were not completed. No video footage was obtained due to no cameras monitoring the area. Scene Processing: Photographs of the scene were taken and uploaded as attachments. I attempted to lift latent fingerprints from the trailers surface, fencing and the pliers. The surfaces were textured and prints were unable to be obtained. I located two items: A pair of black and blue Kobalt pliers and a white Adidas shirt. The pliers and the shirt were gathered and processed as evidence. I processed the evidence according to Maryland State Police policy and placed the evidence into a temporary storage locker on 08/27/2023. Narrative: On 08/27/2023, at approximately 0833 hours, I Trooper First Class Forsyth #6868 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack was operating marked Maryland State Police unit N-29. At this time, I was dispatched to the State Highway Administration (SHA) shop located at 502 Quince Orchard Road, Gaithersburg, Montgomery County, Maryland for a theft. At approximately 0847 hours, I arrived on scene and made contact with the Heavy Equipment Supervisor, Ouattara, Mory (#1/M, DOB: 10/28/1971) identified by his Maryland drivers license. Ouattara showed me where the battery was stolen from and then proceeded to show me where he believed that the suspect entered from. I asked Ouattara when he realized that the battery was missing. Ouattara stated that he noticed the battery was missing around 0745 hours. He stated that he was making his walk around of the shop and noticed that one of the arrow board trailers battery compartment was open. The arrow board trailer was bearing Maryland registration 08682SG. He observed that the battery was missing and that the wires were undone. There was a pair of black and blue Kobalt pliers on the tongue area of the trailer next to the battery compartment. I asked Ouattara if the pliers belonged to anyone at the shop. Ouattara stated that the pliers did not belong to anyone. I asked if anyone had touched the trailer or the pliers. He stated that no one has touched it. I informed the employees to not touch anything as I inspected the area of the fence. While at the fence, I observed that two of the barbed wires at the top were previously cut. The wires had rust on the exposed ends. A board was resting against a pole of the fence at a slanted slope. A white t-shirt was on the ground next to the board. Ouattara stated that the board and shirt was not there the day prior. I took photographs of both areas. I attempted to lift latent fingerprints from the surfaces. I was unsuccessful with obtaining prints. I gathered the pliers and the shirt for evidence. Due to the battery having no serial number, I did not do a check of the RAPID system. I request this case be suspended due to having no additional information to further investigate. </NarrativeText>
