         <NarrativeText>R-24 equipped with in-car camera and body-worn camera. Case# 23-MSP-013323 Defendant: Clifton Leon Mitchell Date of Birth: 12/16/1961  Date of Arrest: 04/15/2023 Time of Arrest: 0307 hours DUI #: 23-205 Citation #: 4450XD0   Certificates and Training *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  *Certified Emergency Medical Technician by the Maryland Institute of Emergency Medical Services Systems  *Certified RADAR/LIDAR operator by the Maryland State Police  *Certified License Plate Reader (LPR) operator by the Maryland State Police  Vehicle In Motion (Phase 1)  On April 15th, 2023 at approximately 0248 hours I, Trooper Sigman #7376, currently assigned to the Golden Ring Barrack, was on routine patrol of the outer loop of 695 at York Road when I observed a black Lexus sedan bearing Maryland registration of 1EJ6704 stopped in the middle of the ramp to York Road. I then activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on the Lexus.  Personal Contact (Phase 2)  I then made a passenger side approach of the black Lexus, identified myself, the reason for the stop, and requested the drivers license. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I also observed the driver had bloodshot glassy eyes, slurred speech upon conversation, and slow uncoordinated muscle movements. The driver then handed me a Maryland license which identified the driver as Clifton Leon Mitchell (12/16/1961). Mitchell stated that he was following a female home from the Gold Club Bar off of Pulaski Highway in Essex. Mitchell stated that the female he was following got pulled over. Mitchell advised that he believed it was safe to stop in the middle of the ramp and wait for her. I then asked Mitchell to move his vehicle off the ramp and pull to the closest parking lot on York Road as there was no shoulder on the ramp. Mitchell then slowly proceeded up the ramp and pulled into the nearest parking lot.  I then made a drivers side approach of the black Lexus. I then requested Mitchell to exit and walk behind his vehicle. Mitchell then exited his vehicle. Upon exiting I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and person. I also observed that Mitchell displayed gait ataxia. I then asked Mitchell how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed prior to driving. Mitchell stated a beer or two. Mitchell also advised that he had smoked cannabis earlier in the evening. I then asked Mitchell if he would submit to standardized field sobriety testing. Mitchell agreed.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3)  The evaluation was performed in an open parking lot off of York Road. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 56 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of streetlights, and overhead lights, and my vehicles takedown lights. My vehicles front facing emergency lights were deactivated for the duration of the field sobriety tests. Mitchell appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries and or defects.  I asked Mitchell the following questions:  Injuries- none Medical conditions- none Medications- none Glasses or contacts- has, not currently wearing Alcoholic beverages- one or two Controlled dangerous substance- cannabis    Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The test was properly explained. I then began the test. I did not observe any resting nystagmus. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit - present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - present in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - present in both eyes *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus - not present in either eye  Mitchell had to be reminded to focus on the stimulus. Mitchell repeatedly said he was nervous and would stop following the stimulus.     Walk and Turn (6/8 clues observed)  Prior to Mitchell performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Mitchell if he had any questions. Mitchell stated that he understood the test.    Instructional Stage: Steps out of starting position twice. Mitchell had to be instructed how to get back into the starting position multiple times.   Walking Stage (1st Nine):  Steps off line Raises arms for balance Misses heel to toe Stops walking after 3 steps and again after the 8th step After the 8th step Mitchell indicated that he did not remember how to complete the test. The test was then concluded.    Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  Not attempted      Turn: Not attempted  One Leg Stand (3/4)  Prior to Mitchell performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Mitchell advised that he understood the test.  Instructional Stage: Sways from side to side     Balance and Count Stage  Seconds 0-10: Raises arms for balance Sways from side to side      Seconds 11-20: Sways from side to side Puts foot down Raises arms for balance      Seconds 21-30: Raises arms for balance Sways from side to side Puts foot down     Arrest  Based on the following, I had probable cause to believe Mitchell was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and a controlled dangerous substance to wit cannabis:  *Stopped in the middle of a highway exit ramp *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and person *Admission to consuming multiple alcoholic beverages *Admission to consuming a controlled dangerous substance *Glassy eyes *slurred speech *Gait ataxia *Poor SFST     At this time Mitchell was placed under arrest for DUI. Mitchell was then handcuffed, searched, and placed in the front seat of R-24 and seat belted inside. Due to the proximity of the barrack and the subjects residence Mitchells hands were moved to the front, and he was handed a DR15. The audio version of the DR15 was then played aloud. At the conclusion of the audio Mitchell stated that he did not wish to take the intoximeter test. The time was 0324 hours. While seated in my vehicle Mitchell stated that he made a lapse in judgment. in regard to stopping on the highway.  20-Minute Observation Period:  N/A     Intoximeter Result:  N/A  Mitchell was then issued the appropriate citations as well as a DR15A. Mitchell was then driven to his residence in Cockeysville and released to his neighbor outside his apartment.  All above events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
