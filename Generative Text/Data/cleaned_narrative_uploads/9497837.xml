         <NarrativeText>On February 2, 2023, at approximately 1500 hours, members of SOG-W and Sgt Hartsock was assisting investigators with Allegany County Narcotics Task Force with an operation in the area of Maryland Ave near S. Central Ave, Cumberland, Allegany County, MD.  During this time, attention was directed to a blue Ford Focus bearing MD registration (2EW9942) that was subject of an ongoing CDS investigation in Allegany County. As the Ford was traveling from S. Central Ave to Maryland Ave prior to entering lanes on W/B I-68, Sgt Bittinger was directly behind the Ford and observed it fail to stop at the stop sign/stop line at the intersection of S. Central ave and Maryland Ave. It should be noted, the stop sign is clearly posted on the right shoulder clear of obstructions. Additionally, as the Ford failed to stop, I, S/Tpr Whorton was operating my unmarked MSP vehicle CE-144 with Sgt Hartsock riding in the front passenger seat and was able to observe the Ford as it turned right just past the stop sign and traveling toward I-68 W/B.   Once the Ford began traveling on W/B I-68, I began to pursue the vehicle and was able to get behind the Ford as it exited W/B I-68 onto S. Lee Street traveling toward Green Street. As the Ford exited I-68 and turned right onto S. Lee Street, it also failed to signal its intent to exit I-68 and did not signal as it traveled from the ramp to S. Lee Street. The Ford stopped at the stop light at the intersection of S. Lee Street at Green Street before making a right turn and began traveling toward Smallwood Street. As the vehicle approached Smallwood Street, I activated my emergency equipment and attempted to stop the Ford. The Ford continued a short distance and stopped on the right shoulder.  As the vehicle stopped, I made contact with the driver identified as Renee Yvonne Walker (08/11/1968) and passenger who was later identified as Malik Wimberley(11/11/1998). While speaking with Walker, she appeared nervous as she looked for her vehicle information. Walkers hands were shaking and appeared to be breathing excessively. Based on events leading to the traffic stop during the operation, I asked Walker to exit the vehicle to speak with her. While speaking with Walker, Sgt Smith asked Wimberley to exit the vehicle to prepare for a K9 scan of the vehicle. As Wimberely exited the vehicle, he began nervously asking questions and appeared to me that he may have been considering fleeing from the scene based on his body language. Wimberley was looking around and stepping around as if he was overly nervous. Wimberley inquired as to why he was asked to exit the vehicle and was informed that a K9 scan of the vehicle was going to be conducted. Wimberley then advised he was concerned about marijuana being inside the vehicle.  During this time, Deputy Pierce of the Allegany County Sheriffs Office conducted a free air K9 scan of the vehicle, utilizing his K9 partner Udo, which yielded a positive alert for the presence of narcotics.  A probable cause search of the Ford was conducted, which revealed the following CDS and CDS paraphernalia: 1- One small clear bag containing trace amounts of suspected crack cocaine (Located on the drivers side, inside a black cigarette purse) 2- One clear glass smoking device containing a rock of suspected crack cocaine (Located on the drivers side, inside a black cigarette purse stored inside a plastic yellow tubular container)  Based on the suspected CDS items located inside the vehicle, Walker was charged via Criminal Citation (202001914811) for possession of CDS Not Marijuana.  After the Ford was searched, Wimberley was arrested for previous Distribution of Narcotics in Allegany County, MD as he was the subject on an ongoing CDS investigation with ACNTF Investigators. Once Wimberley was placed in custody a search of his person was conducted. During the search, a sum of US Currency and a black smartphone was recovered. As I was searching Wimberley, I asked him to take off his shoes and he immediately became nervous and was attempting to reach down the back of his underwear. Based on this, I suspected he was concealing contraband inside his under and I checked area beneath his waist band however did not observe anything. I suspected Wimberley had contraband concealed inside himself or in his groin area near his anus based on his behavior. I advised Wimberley of my suspicion, however he would not admit to concealing anything but pleaded with myself and Sgt Smith not to take him to jail. Wimberley was placed in Sgt Smiths vehicle and transported to the jail for charges ACNTF investigators were pursing related to their investigation. While transporting Wimberley, he advised Sgt Smith that he was concealing CDS inside his right sock beneath his foot.  Once Sgt Smith arrived at the jail, Four (4) bags of suspected crack cocaine was recovered from Wimberleys person inside his right sock.  The suspected CDS items related to Walker was processed into evidence and documented on MSP Form 67 (Chain of Custody) and Property Record (P-342961). ACNTF Investigators documented the CDS items related Wimberley as part of their ongoing investigation.  All the above events occurred in Allegany County, MD.  Case closed.  </NarrativeText>
