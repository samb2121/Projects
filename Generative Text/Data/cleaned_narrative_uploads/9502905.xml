         <NarrativeText>On 04/03/2023, I TFC Doyle #6144 was dispatched to 22006 Jefferson Blvd Smithsburg MD 21783 in Washington County, Maryland, for a suicide in progress. I was advised by dispatch that the suspect who was later identified as Travis Lee Smith DOB: 01/26/1984 by his Maryland Drivers license, sent a video to his ex-wife with a blue rope around his neck and attached above his head to the ceiling. The ex-wife sent the video via email to the Maryland State Police Hagerstown Barrack. I was advised that Travis stated in the video he has to do it and goodbye.   When I arrived at the scene I knocked on the door multiple times and announced who I was and with. No one was answering the door and all doors were locked and secured. I was giving permission to make entry into the house to check on the welfare of Travis. The door was kicked in to make entry and my name was announced. At that time Travis came up from the basement and provided his Maryland license to me. I asked Travis what was going on. Travis stated he was sick and tired of everything, that he has lost everything. I asked Travis if he knew why I was there to which he stated yes. Travis admitted he did take the video and send it to his ex-wife. Travis stated he sent the video to make his ex-wife scared due to she told him to go kill himself on Saturday. Travis was transported via EMS to Mertius Medical Center. I followed the ambulance.    While following the ambulance. TFC ONeal advised me over the radio that there were two rifles laying in a bedroom in plain sight. TFC ONeal provided the information to the Maryland State Police Hagerstown Barrack. The firearms were identified as a Savage Cricket .22 caliber, Serial Number 3018278, rifle which was unloaded and had no ammo, and a Remington .22 caliber rifle model 34 IP. Both firearms were inside the residence in which Travis resides in. Travis is the sole occupant of the house but does not own the house. The firearms were placed on a chain of custody (MSP 67) and released to Carl Lee Smith DOB: 08/06/1956.  The Maryland State Police Gun Center was contacted and advised us the guns were not stolen, but Travis was prohibited to possess any firearms due to he was a felon. Travis was released to Mertius Medical Center for the emergency petition at approximately 1415 hours.   I reported to the Washington County District Court to apply for a temporary Extreme Risk Protective Order. The order was granted by the judge and I returned to Mertius Medical Center and served the Extreme Risk Protective Order on Travis.  Travis was released from Mertius Medical Center at 1633 hours and placed under arrest for possession of a firearm when prohibited. Travis was transported to the Washington County Detention Center where he was released into their custody.  All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland.        Case closed due to arrest.  </NarrativeText>
