         <NarrativeText>INCIDENT WAS RECORDED WITH BODY WORN CAMERAS AND MVR Q-31  VICTIMS/COMPLAINANTS: State of Maryland TPR. Houck #7577 (301) 345-3101 10100 Rhode Island Ave, College Park, MD 20740  TFC Strine #6972 (301)345-3101 10100 Rhode Island Ave, College Park, MD 20740  DEFENDANT: Kenneth Michael West 3612 Marlbrough Way College Park, MD 20740 CHARGES: CR 3-203 did assault Trooper Houck #7577 in the second degree in violation of CR 3-203, contrary to the form of the act of the assembly in such case made and provided and against the peace, government, and dignity of the state. CR 3-203 did assault TFC Strine #6972 in the second degree in violation of CR 3-203, contrary to the form of the act of the assembly in such case made and provided and against the peace, government, and dignity of the state. CR 408(b) did intentionally resist arrest CR 6-402 did trespass and enter the property at Pepco Power Company lot, said property being posted against trespassers in a conspicuous manner. CR 10-203 did willfully fail to obey a reasonable and lawful order of the law enforcement officer, to wit, stop walking and identify himself, made to prevent a disturbance to the public peace. NARRATIVE: On 02/22/2023 at approximately 0050 hours, I Trooper Houck #7577 was approached by a white male at the I-95/I-495 park and ride, who was asking for directions to a walking trail. As I had just received a call for service, I told him I was not able to assist him at the moment but would return once I was available. After returning from the call for service at approximately 0100 hours, I attempted to locate him, eventually driving into the Pepco Power Company lot, which is posted private property. Upon pulling into the Pepco Power Company lot, I activated my lights, stepped out of my patrol vehicle and made contact with the subject. I informed the subject that he was on private property, and would have to leave the premise. The subject became argumentative, refused to stop walking, and refused to identify himself. Upon stepping in front of him to slow his travel, he shoved my arm, and continued walking. At this time, I gave him a lawful order to stop walking and identify himself, when this order was refused, I advised the subject he was being detained and attempted to place him handcuffs. The subject then resisted my attempts to place him and handcuffs and attempted to flee. At this time, myself and TFC Strine #6972 assisted the subject to the ground, and utilized control holds, allowing me to place handcuffs on the subject. I then assisted the subject to his feet. Shortly afterwards, he freed one of his hands from the handcuffs, struck TFC Strine in the face, and attempted to flee. TFC Strine then assisted the subject to the ground, and I placed myself on top of him, striking him one time with a closed hand to the facial area. The subject then ceased his resistance, and I was able to once again place him in handcuffs.    The subject was then identified as Kenneth Michael West DOB 03/26/1990. West requested medical treatment, and was transported to Laurel Regional Hospital, upon his release, he was transported to Maryland State Police Barrack Q for processing. During his processing, West attempted to flood the holding cell by flushing his t-shirt in the toilet, and remained otherwise disruptive throughout his processing.  Following his processing, West was transported to Upper Marlboro DOC, and brought before a commissioner.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Due to the above stated events, I request this case be considered closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Supplement Report  Defendant:Kenneth Micheal West DOB: 03/26/1990  Narrative:    On 02/22/23 at approximately 1250 hours, Trooper Houck #7577 and I, TFC Strine #6972 were dispatched to respond to a vehicle off the roadway on I-95 near MD Rt. 212 Upon entering the Park and Ride, we were flagged down by a white male who was standing by a vehicle. The subject asked us if we were police, or security guards, but advised he had been walking for some time and needed help getting home. I also observed what appeared to be a young female parked in a parking spot with the vehicle running. I advised the subject that we were on a call for service, but to remain there, and we would return momentarily to provide assistance. As we were leaving, I observed the subject begin to walk around the parking lot with his hands tucked in his pants, giving me an uneasy feeling. Upon not locating the vehicle off the roadway, we proceeded back to the Park and Ride to locate the subject. We were unable to locate the subject in the Park and Ride lot, but observed the gate to Pepco Power Company lot, where they keep their vehicles and equipment, open. This lot is posted private property owned by Pepco Power Company, and in the past we have been asked to routinely check this area if the gate is left open due to theft. We proceeded into the lot, and observed the subject walking away from the power companys vehicles and equipment on their gravel road. We activated our emergency equipment and made contact with the subject. He was immediately irate stating things such as oh now you want to help me, your body cameras arent on. Due to my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, I was able to observe signs of impairment consistent with that of a controlled dangerous substance. I advised the subject that he was currently on private property on multiple occasions.    I identified myself to the subject with my name and badge number. While speaking with the subject, he extended his arm to knock Trooper Houcks arm away, and pushed him back slightly. I immediately began telling the subject that he was not to lay a hand on us again. I continued to order the subject to stop walking and to identify himself, but he refused. At this point, we stopped the subject from walking any further, and advised him we were placing him in handcuffs. The subject acted as if he was going to comply with handcuffing procedures, and then quickly began to jerk his arms away from us. We then advised the subject to stop resisting, at which point he began to break free from our grasp. We quickly preformed a takedown on the subject in an attempt to gain compliance and effect the arrest. While on the ground the subject continued to grab and push us in an attempt to get us off of him, The subject then began kicking me, so I wrapped up his legs with both arms and pinned them to the ground with my shoulder. Trooper Houck placed the subject in handcuffs, and we began walking him back to my patrol vehicle. I had Trooper Houck go retrieve the subjects shoes, at which point the subject was able to slip one hand out of handcuffs and attempted to run away. I kept a firm grasp on the subjects left arm that still had the handcuffs attached. I pulled the subject towards me, and wrapped both arms around the subject. While wrapping up the subject his right hand and arm came forward and struck me on the left side of my head. The subject and I proceeded back to the ground where Trooper Houck came back to assist. The subject began saying alright as if he was giving up, but he continued to try to push and grab us to get us off of him. We managed to wrestle the subject onto his left side and gave multiple commands to of put your hands behind your back. Trooper Houck then delivered a close handed strike to the subjects face, and we were able to get him placed back in handcuffs. The subject was then identified as Kenneth Micheal West 03/26/1990, and EMS was called to the scene. West was transported to Laurel Regional Health where he was treated for minor injuries bad released back into our custody.    While completing the necessary paperwork to have West transported to Upper Marlboro Department of Corrections, West was placed in holding cell 1. During completion of the paperwork, West took off his shirt and stuffed it in the toilet and began flushing the toilet. After partially flooding the cell with toilet water, West then threw his wet shirt under the cell door and out into the hallway. We had to proceed into the cell, and place West back in handcuffs, so we could attempt to proceed with the necessary paperwork. Even while handcuffed and shirtless, West continued to flush the toilet repeatedly in an attempt to flood the cell again. Upon completion of the paperwork, we went to retrieve West from the cell, and placed him in the front seat of my patrol vehicle for transport to Upper Marlboro Department of Corrections. While in the front passenger seat, West continuously twisted rotated and tried to pull his hands through the handcuffs while stating things like Im not trying to get out, I just want you to know Im not trying to do anything. West also stated that next time hes approached by a cop he was going to hit them for real this time since he was already getting charged with Second Degree Assault. During my entire interaction with West he was very argumentative, vulgar, and belligerent through the entire process. West also threatened me multiple times. After transport, West was released to Upper Marlboro DOC to see a Commissioner.    All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
