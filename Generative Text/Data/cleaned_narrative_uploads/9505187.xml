         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-217 R HARDESTER JR ID: 23-MSP-014215 Defendant: Todd David Hardester Jr. TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On April 22, 2023 at approximately 0045 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Wilson Point Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed an orange Toyota Tacoma failing to drive within a single lane and traveling above the posted speed limit. The Toyota was bearing Maryland registration 3EF3737.    Right over solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Drove on solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Drove on solid white lane line with the driver side tires.  Changed from lane one into lane two. The Toyota continued across the lane and crossed right over the solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Observed speed at 58-MPH in a 35-MPH speed zone.  Drove on solid white fog line with passenger side tires.  The Toyota accelerated away from my patrol vehicle at what appeared to be above the posted 35 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar, which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 58 MPH in a posted 35 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on Eastern Boulevard at Old Eastern Avenue.  The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Toyota on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle. There was a female passenger. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Todd David Hardester Jr. While speaking with Hardester Jr., I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Also, I observed his speech to be slurred. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Toyota and requested Hardester Jr. to exit his vehicle. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking to Hardester Jr. outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Hardester Jr. stated he had 3 beers (Coors Light). Additionally, Hardester Jr. advised his last beer was approximately 40-50 minutes prior to driving. When asked where he was coming from, Hardester Jr. stated he was coming from Tavern in the Quarters (Bar) and was driving home. I informed Hardester Jr. that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed in the parking lot beside Eastern Boulevard. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a flannel, shorts, and shoes.  I asked Hardester Jr. the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None. Physical Injuries  None. Medication  None. Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.     Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.     Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Hardester Jr. stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Broke the instructional position to the right three times.  Walking Stage (1stNine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than a  inch on steps 2 and 5.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Completed 10 steps instead of the instructed nine.  Turn:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Did not complete turn as instructed.  Walking Stage (2ndNine):    Stepped completely offline on steps 2 and 8.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Completed 10 steps instead of the instructed nine.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Hardester Jr. stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Hardester Jr. kept his arms behind his back instead of flat at his side like instructed.  -Left foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Second 0-10:    Placed raised left foot on the ground.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Swayed body to the left and right.  Seconds 11-20:    Hopped to maintain balance.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Swayed body to the left and right.  Seconds 21-30:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Swayed body to the left and right.  PBT #70005012: Refused.  ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Hardester Jr. was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0109 hours, I placed Hardester Jr. under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for further processing.  Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Hardester Jr. with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Hardester Jr. was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights. At 0136 hours, Hardester Jr. agreed to take a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Hardester Jr. beginning at 0121 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Hardester Jr. was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Cpl. Wallace of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Hardester Jr.s first attempt on the instrument registered as mouth alcohol. Hardester Jr.s mouth was again checked and he had nothing in his mouth. The 20-minute observation period was restarted at 0150 hours. Hardester Jr. had a result of .13 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0215 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****.13 grams of alcohol*****  Hardester Jr. was polite and cooperative throughout the interaction. He was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
