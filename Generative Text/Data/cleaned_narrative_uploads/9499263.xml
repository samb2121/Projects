         <NarrativeText>Focus of Supplemental Report: Initial Report  Victim: John Edward Kostick 31691 West Edge Rd. Millington MD DOB 6/21/66 Phone 410-708-0390  Narrative: Investigators were requested to respond to meet with John Kostick at his residence located at 31691 West Edge Rd. Millington MD for a report of an alleged theft. Upon arrival I met with Kostick at his shop which was located across the street from his residence. Kostick stated he wished to report that his wife had stolen money from him. He confirmed that he was still married to his wife and that she did still live with him at 31691 West Edge Rd. Millington MD. Kostic then escorted me across the street and showed me a safe that contained cash and firearms. The safe was manufactured by the Cannon Safe Company. He reported to me that approximately $102,000 in cash had been removed from the safe by his wife. Kostick stated that his wife Patty did have free access to the safe and knew the combination and had a key.   Upon observation of the safe as well as the residence and surrounding area, I did not observe any signs of forced entry to the safe or the residence. John also stated he did not have any suspicion that anybody other than his wife would have taken the money. John stated that it is not unusual for him to keep large amounts of cash in the safe and that both he and his wife Patty use the cash instead of credit cards more often than not. This case was initially referred to the Maryland State police due to a possible conflict on interest with the Kent County Sheriffs office.  The possible conflict was that Kosticks daughter Stacey Shockley, had recently left the Kent County Sheriffs office and divorced another Deputy that was still employed with them. Stacey now currently works for the Maryland State Natural Resources Police. Stacey and other family members were interviewed and it was found that due to the fact that there was no forced entry to the residence or the safe, Kostick and his wife were married at the time, Kosticks wife had free access to the safe and its contents; this made any contents of the safe martial property. I confirmed with Kostick that no other family members had keys or the combination to the safe. Due to the above mentioned facts, it was determined that no crime occurred. Kostick was referred to various counseling resources, and he was advised if he wanted to take further action, he could do so as a civil matter.  Case CLOSED  </NarrativeText>
