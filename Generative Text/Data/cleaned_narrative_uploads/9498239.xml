         <NarrativeText>  On 02/07/2023 at approximately 1500 hours, the Frederick County Sheriffs Office gave a lookout for a vehicle which they later determined was located in the LEC/Barrack parking lot at 110 Airport Drive E, Frederick, MD. The driver of the vehicle was reported to be armed, and I later found out that the driver was also possibly suicidal and homicidal. At that time, I was sitting at the Frederick Barrack Duty Officers desk. When I learned that the lookout vehicle was in the barrack parking lot, I exited the building and observed multiple deputies (at least two) with a pickup truck near the exit for the parking lot. I immediately approached the pickup truck to assist the deputies. I positioned myself behind a deputy who was at the passenger side window; I was against the passenger side, near where the bed meets the cab. Both deputies were speaking with the driver/sole occupant. The deputy with me advised that he was going to grab stop sticks. I then took that deputys position at the passenger side window. TFC Carter (6361) arrived. Both TFC Carter and a deputy placed stop sticks in front of the vehicle tires. The deputy at the driver side window had the driver exit the vehicle. Sheriffs deputies began to place the driver in custody. One of the police officers on scene advised that there was a gun under the drivers seat. I opened the passenger side door, and observed a handgun in plain view, partially protruding from under the drivers seat. I immediately took possession of the handgun to secure it. I removed the magazine and removed a cartridge from the chamber. After making the handgun safe, I handed it to one of the deputies on scene. I remained on scene while sheriffs deputies searched the vehicle, and observed that they removed an AR-15 style rifle from the vehicle as well.    All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.    Criminal Case handled by FCSO.</NarrativeText>
