         <NarrativeText> On February 09, 2023, at approximately 0715 hours, members of the Metropolitan Area Drug Task Force were conducting proactive drug trafficking interdiction efforts at the Baltimore Washington International FedEx Express Facility located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  During their efforts, investigators observed a brown FedEx Express cardboard box that displayed numerous shipping anomalies and it was removed for the delivery stream for further investigation.  The shipment displayed the following information (written below as written on label):  One (1) brown FedEx cardboard box with white label bearing FedEx tracking number: 5923 5997 9150. This is a unique tracking number only assigned to this shipment.   Shipper: WHPA  PET IQ INC  1419 ST SIMON CIR  ALHAMBRA, CA 91803 UNITED STATES US   Consignee: ERIC JOHNSON  418 SOUTH CAMDEN AVE  FRUITLAND MD 21826   Your affiant notedthis packagewas addressed to and sent from common names. Your affiant conducted a query of the above listed tracking number and discovered it was shipped from Alhambra, California, a city and state known to your affiant to be a possible source for controlled dangerous substance.   Based on the totality of the circumstances, investigators requested thatSergeant Murphy #2936 of the Maryland State Police / Metropolitan Area Drug Task Force along with his canine partner Mia #3191conduct a canine drug scan on the aforementioned parcel identified above bearing FedExtracking number: 5923 5997 9150.  Sergeant Murphy and his canine partner Miaconducted a drug scan on this target parcel.Sergeant Murphys canine partner Mia displayed several behavioral changes on this targeted parcel bearing tracking number5923 5997 9150 for the odor of controlled dangerous substances. Sergeant Murphy advised me that canine Mias behavioral changes constitute an alert for the odor of controlled dangerous substances.  Drug detector canine Mia is trained to detect the odor of controlled dangerous substances. These controlled dangerous substances include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, black tar heroin, methamphetamine, hash and ecstasy. Upon detection of any of these seven (7) controlled dangerous substances odors, canine Mias behavior will change. Canine Mia is trained to come to a final response by passively sitting at the source of the odor. This is called a passive final response. This response may also indicate items recently contaminated with, or associated with, the odor of one or more of the aforementioned controlled dangerous substances.  Sergeant Murphy and his canine partner Mia have completed a 440-hour drug detection canine course with the Maryland State Police Department and Mia is certified in the detection of the odors of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, black tar heroin, methamphetamine, hash and ecstasy through the United States Police Canine Association. Additionally, the Maryland State Police Department requires all canine handlers and canines to go through annual training.  After the canine drug scan, investigators seized the aforementioned parcel bearing tracking number5923 5997 9150 from the FedEx shipping facility located at the Baltimore/Washington International Airport, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland and your affiant brought it to the Metropolitan Area Drug Task Force (MADTF) / High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA), located in Prince Georges County, Maryland where it is currently being stored for safe keeping.  All events did occur in Anne Arundel andPrince GeorgesCounties, Maryland.   Due to delivery constraints a controlled delivery was not completed so secondary processing of the above listed evidence was conducted and the evidence was packaged and sealed under Maryland State Property # P310500 and weight, including all packaging at 4,650 grams, verified by Sgt. McNeely. The parcel of marijuana and THC cartridges was stored in the Maryland state Police CED Headquarters Evidence Locker and was seized for destruction. Members of the MADTF will continue to monitor this address for any further shipments and conduct follow ups accordingly. All events did occur in Anne Arundel and Prince Georges Counties, Maryland.
