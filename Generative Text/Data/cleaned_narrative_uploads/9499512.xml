         <NarrativeText>Crash Team Investigation (For review by the MSPCrash Team)     INVESTIGATION:  On April 19th, 2023 I was contacted by the Virginia State Police in reference to assisting them with obtaining medical records for two individuals that were involved in a fatal motor vehicle collision on April 12th, 2023. Trooper Callahan reported that the collision involved a vehicle and multiple pedestrians. Two of the pedestrians were transported to TidalHealth in Salisbury, Maryland for treatment of their injuries. The pedestrians were identified as:    Duane Lee Turner (DOB 11/11/1983)  Morgan Evans (DOB 08/02/2016)   On May 23rd, 2023 I authored an application for a search warrant for the above individuals records. The application was presented to the Honorable Karen Ketterman, Judge of the District Court of Maryland. Judge Ketterman issued the warrant.   On May 25th, 2023 a copy of the warrant was faxed to the records unit of TidalHealth.  On May 31st, 2023 I checked with TidalHealth who advised that they had no record of the warrant. A copy was then delivered directly to them.   On June 6th, 2023, The medical records were received by the MSP Crash Team.
