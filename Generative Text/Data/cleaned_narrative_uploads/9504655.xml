         <NarrativeText>Narrative:   On May 16, 2023 at approximately 1530 hours, an individual reporting to be Peter Joseph John Tiernen telephoned the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack from telephone number 240-334-2627. Peter initially told the Emergency Dispatcher that answered his call that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), that he was tired of this world, and he wanted to speak to the Barracks former Chaplin, Monsignor Karl. Peter would not provide his location, nor would he provide his date of birth to the Emergency Dispatcher. When Peter believed he was not going to be put in contact with Monsignor Karl, he terminated the telephone call.    Cpl. R. Jackson #5561 called the telephone number back, and the call was answered by a man identified as Delonte. Delonte put Peter back on the telephone with Cpl. Jackson. Peter explained to Cpl. Jackson that he was in the military and worked as a US government contractor for over 40 years. Peter stated he now suffers from PTSD, and he feels that his service to his country and sacrifices he has made are not appreciated. Peter stated that, years ago when he was at his absolute lowest, he met and spoke with Monsignor Karl, who lifted his spirits by reminding him of his self-worth. Cpl. Jackson told Peter that his service and sacrifice for his country are appreciated by those who understand commitment to, and love of, country. Cpl. Jackson thanked Peter for his service and his sacrifice, and Peter stated, Thats all I needed to hear. I dont need to talk to Father Karl now. Hes busy. Cpl. Jackson asked Peter if he was considering hurting himself. Peter said, No, Im not going to hurt myself or anybody. Cpl. Jackson asked him whether he was contemplating suicide. Peter stated, No. Im a Catholic. I would never do that. Peter then tried to end the conversation, but Cpl. Jackson managed to convince him to stay by the telephone and wait for a call from Monsignor Karl.    Monsignor Karl telephoned Peter and spoke with him for an extended period of time. Monsignor Karl then telephoned Cpl. Jackson at the Leonardtown Barrack to inform Cpl. Jackson that, while Peter did not make any suicidal statements, he was clearly suffering from mental illness. Monsignor Karl managed to extract Peters location from him. Peter explained to Monsignor Karl that he was at the J-Mart, located in the Bowie Town Center, 15633 Emerald Way, Bowie, MD 20716, and the telephone number Peter was calling from was the J-Marts telephone number. Monsignor Karl also learned that Delonte was the manager of the J-Mart.    Cpl. Jackson, then, contacted the Bowie Police Department and requested they conduct a Welfare Check of Peter, providing them with the information that had been gathered. The Bowie Policed Department contacted Cpl. Jackson approximately one (1) hour later to inform him that they were unable to locate Peter; however, they spoke to Delonte at length. Delonte informed them that Peter frequents the J-Mart, and he talks to Delonte quite often and for extended periods of time. Delonte stated that Peter seems to be a little quirky, but he has never had any reason to believe Peter is a danger to himself or others. Delonte stated that Peter purchased a tin of tobacco and a toothbrush after using the stores telephone, before going on his way.  Case closed with no further police action.</NarrativeText>
