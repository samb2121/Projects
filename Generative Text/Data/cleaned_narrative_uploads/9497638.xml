         <NarrativeText>In-car camera and body worn camera operational, Un-marked Car D25.  Maryland State Police, Bel Air Barrack DWI #23-091 23-MSP-011708  Defendant: Brian Richard Cooper Defendant Address: 191 Frenchtown Rd, Elkton MD 21117 DOB: 02/28/1984 Date of Arrest: 04/01/2023 Time of Arrest: 2306 Subsequent Offender: No Minor in the vehicle: No Driver License Number: MD DL C-160-098-738-153 CDL: No  First Observation:  On 04/01/2023 at approximately 2242 hours I, TFC Allen #7267, was traveling W/B Rt 155 E/O Carico Ln. I was traveling behind a red Ford pickup truck. I then noticed the vehicle drift nearly a full foot over the right shoulder line and made a sudden correction back into the roadway. The vehicle then began to drift towards the center yellow line and then made another sudden correction. The vehicle would also slow down suddenly and increase his speed in sporadic manners. The vehicle then drifted onto the shoulder a second time and at least half of the vehicle was on the shoulder. The vehicle then traveled in this manner for approximately a full minute. The vehicle then made a sudden correction back into the roadway. The vehicle then pulled onto the shoulder and stopped prior to me activating my emergency equipment. I then pulled in behind the vehicle and initiated a traffic stop.  Phase Two- Personal Contact:  Upon my initial approach I met with the driver who I identified via his MD license as Brian Cooper (W/M DOB 02/28/1984). Cooper stated that he was attempting to find his way home and was using his GPS on his phone. Cooper then stated that he knew where he was and that he was going to leave. I informed him that he was being stopped and he needed to provide me with his license and registration. During my interaction with Cooper I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath. Cooper was also acting incredibly dazed, lethargic, and sluggish. Cooper also had blood shot and glassy eyes, and would fumble with his wallet and paperwork. Cooper would even occasionally stare blankly forward similar to a thousand-yard stare. I also had to ask Cooper for his registration a second time and Cooper handed me a copy of his insurance information. When I informed Cooper that he did not give me his registration, he handed me another insurance card. I then requested another unit for standardized field sobriety testing and I requested Cooper to step out of the vehicle to perform the test. Cooper outright refused all testing and refused to step out of the vehicle. Cooper then starred forward in a dazed manner then turned to me and asked me What now?.   Due to Coopers behavior, and multiple signs of intoxication, I informed him that he would be placed under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. I then told Cooper to step out of the vehicle because I would be placing him under arrest and Cooper refused to step out of the vehicle at 2254 hours. I attempted multiple different ways to convince Cooper to step out of the vehicle but he continued to refuse. Cooper became incredibly argumentative and began to curse at me in such ways as Go fuck yourself! At one-point Cooper stated that I would need to drag him out of the vehicle. I then requested additional units stating that Cooper refused to step out of the vehicle. While waiting for additional units, Cooper began to talk on his cellphone with a woman he identified as Amy, and stated it was his wife. Amy instructed Cooper multiple times over the phone to calm down and to not make things worse. Cooper would continue to ignore his wife and continue to yell and scream and curse loudly. Amy asked me what Coopers location was, and when I provided it to her, Cooper yelled the location to the phone and slurred his speech heavily while doing so. Once additional units arrived I informed Cooper that he needed to step out of the vehicle and that he was under arrest. Cooper continued to refuse to step out of the vehicle. I then opened the driver side door and placed my hands-on Coopers wrist to escort him out of the vehicle. When I grabbed Coopers wrist he immediately pulled away and started listing the items that he had in his lap. I placed the items on the dash board and escorted Cooper out of his vehicle. Cooper would also pull away or stiffen up his arms to prevent me from placing his hands into handcuffs. He was passively resisting; however, I was able to affect the arrest without further issue at 2306 hours. It should also be noted that when Cooper was out of the vehicle and escorted towards my vehicle, despite me not using force to guide him there, Cooper displayed his inability to balance and would stumble frequently.  Phase Three- Prearrest Screening  Standardized Field Sobriety Test:  No standardized field sobriety testing was completed due to Cooper refusing all field sobriety testing.  Arrest Due to my training of over 40 hours in DUI detection with live donors at the Maryland State Police Academy, being certified to conduct ARIDE testing through Baltimore County, and the observations of impairment made during the traffic stop; I determined I had probable cause to believe that Cooper was driving under the influence and unable to operate the vehicle safely. Due to the following:   Glassy eyes  Bloodshot eyes  Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on the drivers breath.  Slurred speech  Lethargic manner  Acting in a dazed and confused manner  Fumbling with paperwork.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Stumbling and displaying his inability to balance  Advice of Rights (DR-15) / Certified Blood Test (Accepted). I presented Cooper with the Advice of Rights form (DR-15) in English audio while transporting him the Bel Air Barrack and he refused to submit to an intoximeter test at 2325 hours. When I asked Cooper if he would partake in the test, Coopers response was No, who the fuck would agree to that. It should also be noted that while transporting Cooper to the barrack and prior to playing the DR15 audio, Amy was still on the phone attempting to ask me where the vehicle was. Cooper responded to this by shouting at the top of his lungs The car isnt there, theyre toying it, what dont you understand you dumb bitch!. I then issued filed a statement of charges and probable cause statement, and charged Cooper with failing to obey a lawful order and resisting arrest. It should be noted that while filing the paperwork I had to ask Cooper questions that IPC required, and when I asked Cooper he responded by saying Fuck you. Cooper also refused to sign all DUI related paperwork.  I then transferred Cooper to IPC and released him to their custody at approximately 0208 hours.  Status- closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Harford County Maryland. </NarrativeText>
