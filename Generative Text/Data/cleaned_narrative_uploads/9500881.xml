         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On Tuesday, August 01, 2023, at approximately 2031 hours, the Maryland State Police Cumberland Barrack received a call from Barbara Hartsock, advising that a patient, Shawn Nida, had walked off from the facility. She advised that Nida was held without bond through the Allegany County Detention Center, but released to the Massie Unit at 10102 Country Club Road, Cumberland, Allegany County, Maryland for treatment through an order of the District Court by the Honorable Judge E.M. Bean earlier the same day. Upon completion of the program, Nida was to return to the Allegany County detention center.  Upon my arrival, I immediately noticed that the facility is not secure. I observed a window open to a common area that an adult could easily climb into or out of without trouble. Upon entry to the facility, I observed people roaming about freely with little observation provided by any staff members. Investigation revealed that at approximately 1825 hours, Skylynn Bothwell, LPN, issued Nida his medication at the nurses station, then watched Nida walk outside onto the smoking platform, porch. Brothwell advised that she was dealing with other patients and never saw Nida walk back in from his smoke break. Cpl. Brinkman inspected the porch area and found that the door is not locked and can be opened from the inside by anybody. There was a paper sign on the door, advising that nobody could go out after 1900 hours. It is important to note that the porch was inspected at approximately 2145 hours and there were two subjects smoking cigarettes on the porch at that time, clearly after the supposed 1900 hours time limit. At 1830 hours, Nida was due to attend an education meeting with Alkire, but he never showed. At 1930 hours when it was time to do bed checks, Nida was not in his bedroom either. A check of the facility was conducted, but Nida was not located during the check. Staff then began to make notifications and finally reported the escape to the Maryland State Police an hour after it was discovered. It was immediately apparent that this facility is not designed to rehabilitate a patient that is also a prisoner, but a voluntary patient that is seeking assistance.  While attempting to obtain a clothing description, time and exit-point from which Nida absconded from the facility in order to request resources for a search, such as K-9 and an aviation unit, the manager advised that we could not review video surveillance without a court order. At 2156 hours the 911 center received a call from a citizen, , advising that Nida showed up at her residence at 10109 Country Club Road, Cumberland, Allegany County, Maryland and asked to use the telephone. At approximately 1827 hours, he called 301-876-8156. Law enforcement databases showed the number came back to a Mary Pettie. The caller advised that a white female with reddish dirty blond hair, driving a black Nissan Altima came to the house and picked Nida up and drove off from the residence. Cpl. Brinkman checked the last known address of Nida, which was found on his most recent charging documents, at 114 Center Street, Frostburg, Allegany County, Maryland 21532 with negative results.Allegany County Sheriffs Office Sgt. J. Gordon and Dep. C. McKenzie assisted in the attempt to locate Nida. They located a subject walking along Williams Road matching the vague description, but discovered that it was not Nida. The subject was identified as Thomas Victor Lancaster, IV andwas arrested on an outstanding arrest warrant without issue by Dep. C. McKenzie.  MT Layton,1994, warrant task force with Deputy Fratz and Deputy Bennett, attempted to locate Nida the entire day throughout Allegany County with negative results. They were able to identify Pettie as the person that Nida contacted on the telephone and were able to speak with her at 114 Center Street Frostburg, MD 21532. She denied picking Nida up outside the Massie Unit, but she did admit to speaking with Nida on the phone.  I request that this case remain open, pending Nida being located and the warrant being served.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  On Saturday, August 5, 2023, at approximately 0800 hours the Maryland State Police Cumberland Barrack was notified there was an anonymous tip that Shawn Cody Nida and Mary Louise Pettie were at 114 Center Street Frostburg, Allegany County, MD 21532. The Allegany County Sheriffs Office and Frostburg City Police confirmed both individuals were in the residence. I, ST. E. Wilson #6100, responded to assist with the incident. Pettie exited the building without incident. Nida hid under a bed in the apartment and was captured by the Sheriffs Office and Frostburg City Police. I arrested Pettie at approximately 0810 hours and transported her to the Allegany County Detention Center. Nida was arrested and transported by Frostburg City Police Department to ACDC. Nothing of investigative importance to this incident was mentioned by Pettie during my interaction with her.    The case status is pending the decision of the investigator (MT. Lechliter #2387).    All the above events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
