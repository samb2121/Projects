         <NarrativeText>NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK:  Due to the nature of the crime, no neighborhood check was conducted.  SCENE PROCESSING:  Due to the encounter not being a crime, no scene processing was performed.  NARRATIVE:  On 6/1/23 at approximately 1116 hrs, I, Sgt Christopher J. Black(Maryland State Police) was shift commander at the North East Barrack located at 2433 W. Pulaski Highway, North East, Cecil County, Maryland 21901. At that time, I was contacted in the barrack lobby by the complainant, who identified himself at Lauren Gray and an unknown female.    Gray advised that he was at the barrack to report that he had just had sex in the Walmart parking lot with a male who did not use a condom. I was confused and asked Gray if he was only here to report that he had unprotected sex. The unknown female said that Gray was Stealthed and that was illegal. I advised both subjects that I was not familiar with the term Stealthed. The unknown female explained that Stealthed meant that both agreed to have protected sex and Gray was unaware that the other person was not wearing a condom during intercourse. I asked Gray what had occurred during the encounter. Gray advised that he was working at Walmart and was outside when a white Dodge Ram pulled up to him. Gray stated that the black male operator said that he was cute and wanted to know if Gray was gay. Gray said that he told the black male that he was. Gray advised that the black male asked what time he got off and if he wanted to have sex. Gray stated that he could do it now and got into the truck. Gray said that both agreed to have protected sex with a condom. Gray advised that they had sex in the back of the Dodge Ram in the back parking lot of Walmart that backs up to the North East Barrack. Gray thought he was wearing a condom during the sexual encounter. Gray stated that after the sexual encounter, he got out of the truck and both went separate ways. Gray said that he is allergic to semen and that he started to have an allergic reaction and that is when he discovered that the sex was unprotected. Gray advised that the incident occurred at approximately 0945 hrs. Gray stated that the male identified himself as Mike. Gray described Mike as an older black male with a few missing front teeth. Gray advised that he wrote down his registration number which was identified as 2EE6799 through Maryland.     I had the barrack PCO run the registration plate through MVA. The registration plate came back to a 2016 Dodge Ram and was registered to a Rudolph Allen Williams Sr, B/M, DOB 3/3/64. I showed a photo of Williams to Gray. Gray identified Williams to be the person he had unprotected sex with in the truck. I gave Gray the incident number and informed him that no crime was committed during the encounter. Gray and the unknown female exited the barrack. I then spoke with a few investigators from CED North at the barrack. The investigators along with an attorney with the States Attorneys Office of Cecil County agreed that no crime was committed.     A short time later, Cpl Sexton from CED North was notified that Christiana Hospital safe nurse completed a SAFE kit on Gray. It was also determine that Gray was woman who transitioned to a male. I was unaware of this information when I interviewed Gray at the barrack.  I request the case be closed due to the sexual encounter being consensual by both parties involved.   </NarrativeText>
