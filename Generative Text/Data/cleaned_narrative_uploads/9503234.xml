         <NarrativeText>THIS INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED ON L-18 IN-CAR CAMEA AND BWC #6931. DUI #22-047  TROOPER B. WHITE- ID #6931 MARYLAND STATE POLICE  FORESTVILLE BARRACK L CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING: -NHTSA CERTIFIED TO CONDUCT STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFST) -CERTIFIED PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) OPERATOR -ADVANCED ROADSIDE IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT TRAINING (A.R.I.D.E)  DESCRIPTION OF VIOLATION / INCIDENT / TRAFFIC STOP (VEHICLE IN MOTION)- On February 10, 2022, at approximately 2352 hours, I Trooper First Class White #6931, was on patrol in the area of northbound Pennsylvania Avenue south of Woodyard Road, Prince Georges County, in my unmarked Maryland State Police cruiser L-18. While patrolling, I observed a white Toyota Corolla bearing Maryland registration 2EN3888 traveling in lane number (2) two at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. I paced the Toyota Corolla for 3/10 of a mile at 80 mph in a 55 mph zone. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle.  INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEFENDANT (PERSONAL CONTACT)- I made contact with driver, who was identified by his Maryland Identification Card as Bryan Fitzgerald Brown, DOB: 01/28/1965, African American/male.  While speaking to Brown, I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I observed an open alcoholic beverage (Cools Light Beer) on the drive-side floor next to Browns right leg. Brown admitted to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to and while driving. While speaking with Brown, I observed his speech to be slurred and eyes to be glassy.  I informed Brown that I would be administering standardized field sobriety tests (SFST) on him, to which he agreed to the tests. Prior to administering SFST, I advised Brown I was going to explain the instructions to each of the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on left shoulder of Pennsylvania Avenue. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear. Lighting conditions were clear due to the headlamps of my patrol vehicle. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Brown appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. Brown was asked the following questions: Glasses or Contacts  None Medical Conditions  None. Injuries  None Medication High blood pressure medication (taken at 5 hrs).  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Browns eyes. Brown was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Browns pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Brown was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. While administering this test, Brown moved his head on several occasions. Brown had to be reminded not to move his head. 1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN  (2/8 clues observed). Prior to Brown performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Brown if he understood the test and he stated, Just lock me up. Instructional stage:  1.) Lost balance- Feet broke apart and he stepped offline to the right. 2.) Started too soon- Began test prior to my instruction to began the test.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): Did not complete the test  Turn: Nothing to report.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Did not complete the test.  ONE LEG STAND (Did not complete the test)  While on scene, Brown was offered and agreed to a preliminary breath test, with a result of .13 BrAC.  ARREST Based on the following, I had probable cause to believe Brown was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Driving vehicle in excess of reasonable and prudent speed * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his body and breath * Glassy eyes * Slurred speech * My observed signs of impairment as Brown performed field sobriety tests * Failure maintain balance * Admitted to consuming an alcoholic beverage while and prior to driving * Necessitating repeated instruction. * PBT result of .13 BrAC.  Brown was placed under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol. Brown was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and transported to the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack. Brown was read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form in English via audioat which time heagreed to take the breath test at 0037 hours. The breath test was conducted by Sgt. Iman #5709 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Brown had a result of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0106 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT ***** .14 BrAC grams of alcohol *****  Brown was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to a valid driver. All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
