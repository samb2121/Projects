         <NarrativeText>L-23 MVR and Body Worn Camera activated during this incident   List of Attachments: (1) Statement of Probable Cause (1) Statement of Charges (2) Photographs (1) MSP Form 246 (1) MSP Form 076 Scene Processing I took photos of the injuries related to the incident. Trooper Shai#7463 completed the DV lethality screening with the female.  Neighborhood Checks: Due to the nature of the incident, no neighborhood statements were taken.   On 09/27/2023 at approximately 1038 hours, I, Trooper Thienhom#7518 was dispatched to the area of eastbound Central Avenue in the area of St. Michaels Drive, in regards to a vehicle collision.  Prior to my arrival of the collision, a passerby stopped behind my patrol vehicle and informed me that there was a female and male subject that appeared to be engaging in a physical altercation on the right shoulder on eastbound Central Avenue just prior to Lake Arbor Way. A passerby also advised that observed the male subject taking off his jacket and walking towards the female subject aggressively. A passerby stated, Theres a guy and a lady that were fighting on the side of the street. He was grabbing her and pushing her around. I immediately responded to the area and relayed the information given to dispatch.  Upon my arrival, I observed the black male subject wrapping his arms around the black female and pushing her against the black Mitsubishi Lancer bearing a temporary Virginia registration (Y89067). The black female subject was trying to push him away, but the male subject would not let her go. I stepped out of my vehicle and made my approach. As I approached the two subjects, I observed the male subject still refusing to let the female go and yelling at her aggressively. I immediately separated the two parties. The male subject was identified as Lancaster, Omareun Antonio (DOB:07/06/2002, 1/M). The female subject was identified as Slaughter, Jasmine (DOB: 12/04/1997, 1/F).  I interviewed Slaughter first. Slaughter advised that she did not want to do anything with me and wanted to get as far away from Lancaster as much as possible. As I was speaking with Slaughter, I observed a red mark on her right cheek and a laceration on her chin with blood. I questioned Slaughter about those marks but she refused to give any statements. I then questioned what happened prior to this incident. Slaughter advised that they both just left school from Washington, D.C., and were headed to Six Flags. Slaughter stated that they were arguing and she did not want to get distracted while driving. She then pulled over to the right shoulder, left the vehicle, and tried to escape Lancaster. Slaughter then advised that Lancaster followed her on foot and grabbed her, not letting her go. I asked her again about those marks on her face, and she refused to make any statements. I asked about her relationship with Lancaster and she advised that they have been together for two years and share a child together. At the same time, the Prince Georges County Fire/EMS responded to the area. Slaughter refused the medical treatment.  After interviewing Slaughter, I asked Lancaster about what happened and he stated that she refused to have sex with him. They had both been arguing since they left Washington, D.C. Lancaster then advised that Slaughter pulled to the right shoulder and left the vehicle. Lancaster then jumped in the drivers seat and drove the vehicle slowly alongside Slaughter. Slaughter refused to get back in the vehicle. I then asked Lancaster about the marks on Slaughters face and Lancaster stated that he did not put his hands on her. However, Lancaster later advised that he was grabbing her and refusing to let her walk away from him.  After interviewing both parties, I arrested Lancaster for the second-degree assault. Lancaster was transported to Upper Marlboro Detention Center, awaiting to see the commissioner. Trooper Shai#7463 conducted a lethality screening with Slaughter. She was screened not in high danger. She was offered the Domestic Violence Hotline number, which she denied at this time. Trooper Shai#7463 also had Slaughter completed the written statement. Slaughter advised that that was all the information that she wanted to write it down.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
