         <NarrativeText>  On September 27, 2023 at approximately 1204 hours, I, CPL Buckius #5742 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Queen Annes County Drug Task Force executed a court authorized search and seizure warrant at 120 Pine Tree Rd Chestertown, MD 21620. The warrant was signed by the Honorable Judge Kratovil of the Queen Annes County District Court. The warrant was for the exterior/yard of the property for marijuana plants.    Upon arrival Ellen Fisher exited the residence from the side door of the house. I identified myself and explained the warrant to her. I provided her with a copy of the search warrant and a copy of statute 5-601.2 which pertains to the laws regarding manufacturing of marijuana. Ellen stated her husband, Michael Fisher has been growing the Marijuana plants. I located two mature marijuana plants next to the detached garage. I observed a faux plant netting that was used in an attempt to hide these two plants from the roadway, however the plants were taller and could be seen from Pine Tree Rd. I located five more marijuana plants in a garden in the rear of the property. There was a barrier surrounding the plants which was approximately three feet high. The plants exceeded the height of the barrier. All seven plants were seized. These plants ranged from approximately 2 feet to eight feet in height.    The marijuana plants were transported to the Queen Annes County Drug Task Force, processed and held under property held P-345816. The marijuana plants will be sent to the Lab for destruction per MSP policy.    I consulted the Queen Annes County States Attorney regarding this case. It was determined no charges would be filed regarding this case.    I request this case be closed.    All events did occur in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
