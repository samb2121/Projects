         <NarrativeText> VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On 09/09/2023 at approximately 2200 hours I, Trooper Gibbons # 7441 was on a routine patrol in my marked MSP vehicle V-19. I observed a black Nissan Pathfinder bearing Maryland registration 6CX1360 facing westbound, partially in the ditch on the westbound side. I made contact with the witness who stated that the vehicle after making a left turn from Whaleyville Road to Old Ocean City Road ran off the roadway to the right into a ditch.I then met with the driver. The vehicle was already in the ditch prior to my arrival.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   Before making contact with the driver, I observed him attempting to move the vehicle out of the ditch. I then made contact with the driver who was seated on the drivers side of his vehicle. I later identified the driver as Joseph Christian Monteverde (DOB: 03/18/1982) through his Maryland license. I asked what had happened, he said, I got caught in the truck here, and then pushed out. I then advised him that a witness stated that he turned left and then ran into the ditch. He replied saying, Yes. At that time he said, Im literally right down the road to Willards. I did observe his GPS on his phone to be on, with the destination not even 3 minutes away. The driver stated that he would like Simpsons towing to come and tow his vehicle. He stated that he knew one of the drivers that works for Simpsons towing. The driver continued to mention Jeff Simpson and stated that he knew who Monteverde was. He then continued to repeat himself. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle.His speech was observed to be very slurred while talking to him.I asked Monteverde numerous times for his license. He was not able to locate it. I asked Monteverde where he was coming from, he stated that he was coming from a friends house in Frontier Town. I advised him to continue to try to locate his license. At that time, while walking to my patrol vehicle, I radioed for another unit to start my way for field sobriety. I then approached the vehicle, and asked if he had found his license, he stated that he could not find it, and was calling a friend to see if it was left at her house. Monteverde had difficulty providing me with the requested documentation. I asked how much he had to drink, and he said, Well I was at her campground. So we drank at the campground, and I was driving home.  I asked how long ago was it that he had been drinking, and he said, I dont know man its been a couple of hours. I informed him that it was 2215 hours, he then said, Honestly I cant give you a time. I then asked him what he had been drinking, he said, We had been drinking the White Claws. I asked how many drinks he had. He said, Honestly I dont know. Honestly Frontier Town is right down there.  At approximately 2216 hours TFC. Mitchell # 6296 arrived to assist with the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST). Monteverde exited his vehicle.At this time, I noticed that while Monteverde had no obvious or serious injuries, he did have minor scrapes on his left leg when asked to step out of the vehicle.At this time I noted that Monteverdes movements were slow and intentional and that his balance was very poor. At this time, I observed Monteverdes eyes to be bloodshot and watery. Monteverdes speech was slurred, and his movements were slow and lethargic. Monteverde later admitted to consuming wine at the Wine Fest in Ocean City before driving the Nissan. He stated that he had alot of wine. He stated that he took full glasses of wine from every Vendor there at the park in city near the Convention Center. He then stated that after leaving the Wine Fest, his friend had invited him to her place at the Frontier Town where he had one drink. I informed Monteverde that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests to which he consented.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)    The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of Old Ocean City Road, at Whaleyville Road (610). The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear, and the temperature was approximately 73 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicles headlamps and my flashlight. Monteverde appeared to be in good physical condition, he did have minor scrapes on his left leg when asked to step out of the vehicle.   Injuries - None.  Glasses - Yes  Medical Contitions - Asthma  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)    The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test.The tip of my pointer finger was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Monteverdes eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Monteverdes pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. He was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Monteverdeif he understood the instructions, and he stated yes.     1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes   2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes   3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes    WALK AND TURN (8/8 clues observed)    Prior to Monteverde performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Monteverde was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe while on the solid white line. Monteverde was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Monteverde then placed his left foot in front of his right foot and had to be told twice to place his right foot in front of his left foot. He then replied saying Im sorry, Im sorry. Monteverde was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Monteverde was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Monteverde was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around.Monteverde was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Monteverde was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Monteverde if he understood the test, and he stated, Yes.    Instructional Stage:  1.) Could not maintain balance.  2.) Failed to remain in the instructional position.   Walking Stage (1st Nine):   1.) Missed heel to toe on more than three occasions.  2.) Stepped off-line on more than three occasions.  3.) Swaying.  4.)

ARREST:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Monteverde was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol:   * Slurred speech.  * Slow and lethargic fine motor skills.  * At fault of a motor vehicle collision.  * Difficulty coherently answering questions.  * Bloodshot, watery eyes.  * Admission to consuming One (1) White Claw beer, and a lot of wine  * General confusion and the necessity for me to repeat myself numerous times.  * Difficulty/inability to locate requested documentation.  * Observations while performing SFST.  * PBT result-Refusal at 2229 hours   I arrested Monteverde for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2231 hours and placed him in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. I transported Monteverde to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for processing. While en route to the Berlin Barrack, I utilized the MVA audio recording of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form and had said form read to Monteverde in English. Monteverde agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same at approximately 2246 hours. While in my patrol vehicle, Monteverde stated that he wanted to kill him self numerous times. I asked him multiple times if he wanted to kill himself and why. He stated that he was not going to kill himself. I then called the Berlin Barrack, spoke with Cpl. Ruiz # 0007, and informed him what was said by Monteverde. He stated that he was just upset because this is his second DUI. He stated that he was not married and that his daughter did not want anything to do with him, and that made him upset. He stated that he didnt want to kill himself its must depressing to him to be arrested for his second DUI. After Monterverde spoke with Cpl. Ruiz, he advised me to give Monterverde a ride to his residence.   INTOXIMETER RESULT: Conducted by Cpl Ruiz # 0007   *** 0.21 BrAC *** Serial number 011743   </NarrativeText>
