         <NarrativeText>  On 02/24/2023, I TFC Doyle #6144 was done routine patrol in the area of eastbound Dual highway at Edgewood Drive. I observed the vehicle inform of me accurate at a high rate of speed in lane one. I caught up to the vehicle and began to pace the vehicle. My marked patrol vehicle O-33 speedometer is calibrated as required by the Maryland State Police Policy. The vehicle was traveling 60 miles per hour in a 45 miles per hour zone. The vehicle was identified as a gray Nissan Altima bearing Maryland registration 4EN0191. The Nissan swerved over the fog line on the left shoulder by a tire width. The vehicle slowed back down to 40 miles per hour then accelerated again to 60 miles per hour and swerved over the center doted line into lane two by a tire width. I initiated my emergency equipment and the vehicle merged from lane one to two and stopped eastbound Dual Highway at All Star Court.    I made contact with the driver via the driver side window, who was identified as Casey Ann Schuller DOB: 01/02/1981 by her Maryland identification card. Casey was advised the reason for the stop. Casey was smoking a cigarette and avoided making eye contact with me. While searching for her license and registration i detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. I asked Casey if she had any alcoholic beverages tonight to which she stated she had a few shots. Casey still has not made eye contact with me. I returned to my patrol vehicle and conducted a routine NCIC/METERs check of the vehicle and Casey. Casey returned on a ID only and had no license.    I returned to vehicle via the driver side again and requested Casey exit the vehicle and walk to the front of her vehicle, to which she did. I again asked Casey how much she had to drink. Casey stated she had two shots of vodka before she left the house to go pick up her daughter. While speaking to Casey outside the vehicle I detected to strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her person. I observed Casey to have bloodshot and glassy eyes.
