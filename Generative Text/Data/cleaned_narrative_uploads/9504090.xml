         <NarrativeText>DWI #: 23-009  This incident was captured on J-10 s Mobile Video Recorder and Body-worn Camera.  Defendant:  DL# MD-10272666494 (Maryland Drivers License)  Jon Ari Veracka (2/M, DOB: 04-21-1998)  Charges:  TA - 21-902(a1i) Driving Vehicle While Under The Influence Of Alcohol TA - 21-902(b1i) Driving Veh.

I am A.R.I.D.E (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) Certified.  INITIAL CALL FOR SERVICE  On 01/20/2023 at approximately 0109 hours, I Tpr.Fuller #7354 was on duty operating Marked Unit J-10. I was working a stationary RADAR at Rowe Blvd, monitoring traffic on Rowe Blvd at College Creek. At that time, I observed a silver Chevrolet sedan traveling Northbound Rowe Blvd in lane 2 that appeared to be exceeding the posted speed limit of 40 miles per hour. I activated the rear antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar in the stationary, fastest vehicle mode and obtained a speed reading of 87 in the fastest vehicle window. As the vehicle cleared the Radar beam, the speed dropped off the Radar screen.(The silver Chevrolet Sedan was the only vehicle on the roadway at the time). I conducted a traffic stop on the silver Chevrolet sedan. The radar was calibrated and found to be working properly prior to the traffic stop.  INITIAL CONTACT:  I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver, sole occupant of the silver Chevrolet sedan. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Jon Ari Veracka (2/M, DOB: 04-21-1998). I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage and raw marijuana emitting from the vehicle. I noticed Verackas eyes to be glassy and bloodshot. While conversing with Veracka I detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I asked how many alcoholic beverages he had tonight prior to operating his motor vehicle. Veracka said he had two Yuengling from Adams Ribs. I asked Veracka to step out of the vehicle to conduct the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS:  The tests were conducted on a flat paved area free of debris. My patrol vehicle was positioned in a safe manner, with my forward emergency lights deactivated during all three tests. I asked Veracka if he had any physical injuries that would prevent him from performing the tests. I asked Veracka if he had any head injuries. Veracka advised No. When asked if he was taking any medications, Veracka replied No. Veracka was wearing glasses at the time of the tests.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Verackas eyes. Veracka was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only. Veracka was instructed to follow the tip of the pen with his eyes only until told to stop. Veracka pupils were of equal size and showed equal tracking. Veracka was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  4.) Vertical Nystagmus present  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual.  Veracka was asked if he understood my instruction of the test and he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage:      Starts too soon      Cannot keep balance     Walking Stage (1st Nine):      Missed Heel to Toe on step 5 and 6      Steps off line on two occasion      Raised arms on step 4 and kept them raised     Turn:  Not performed as instructed  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    1. Missed Heel to Toe on step 5, 6, 7 and 8 Steps    2. Steps off line on 4 occasion    3. Continued to keep arms raised  ONE LEG STAND (2/4)  The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual.  Veracka was asked if he understood my instruction of the test and he stated, Yes.  First 10 seconds  Raises arms all throughout  Second 10 seconds  Continued to keep arms raised  Puts foot down once  Third 10 seconds  Continued to keep arms raised  Puts foot down once  PBT Test  Was not offered  ACTION TAKEN:  Veracka was arrested, I conducted a probable cause search on Verackas vehicle. In the center console of the Chevrolet, I observed a clear glass jar with suspected marijuana inside. I opened the clear glass jar and observed suspected marijuana inside. I consolidated the suspected marijuana into a clear zip lock back and completed the search.  Based on my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, I recognized the seized items as Marijuana, less than 1.5 ounces (Personal Amount). I secured Veracka and suspected marijuana in my patrol vehicle. I transported Veracka and the suspected marijuana to the MSP Annapolis Barrack for processing. I played the DR-15 audibly from the MVA website (Advice of Rights) to Veracka in English at 2101 hours. Veracka was given a paper copy of the DR-15 to read along with the audio. Veracka was asked to submit to an alcohol concentration test at the barrack. Veracka refused to submit a sample of his breath. Veracka was charged appropriately for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and issued a Civil Citation for the suspected marijuana.  The suspected Marijuana were weighed, and processed on a Chain of Custody log, and a Property Held Record. All items were secured in the Annapolis barrack CDS locker.  DISPOSITION:  Veracka was charged with DUI, issued a Civil Citation and released to his family member Jaime Babette Frank (2/F 04/06/1962)  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  CASE CLOSED BY ARREST. </NarrativeText>
