         <NarrativeText>  On Sunday, September 17, 2023, at approximately 2133 hours, I, Trooper C. Cooper #7501, responded to 23990 Holsinger Lane, Ridgely, Caroline County, Maryland 21660, in reference to a cardiac arrest.    Upon arrival, I was advised that the cardiac arrest was involving a subject by the name of Katlyn Coleman. I was advised that Coleman was suspected to had overdosed and Caroline County EMS (EMS Run #33615) was performing life-saving procedures within the residence. I then made contact with Colemans mother, identified as Lisa Kent who was standing at the front of the residence. Kent stated that she received a phone call from Colemans boyfriend, identified as Randolph Fitchett, stating that Coleman had overdosed, and it was not good. Kent stated that Randolph told her to get to his house, at which time she did.    After speaking with Kent, I approached a subject who was seated on the front step of the residence with his head tucked into his search. This subject is identified as Jaden Fitchett. Jaden stated that he was home when Coleman overdosed but had no idea what was going on because he was in his room playing video games. Jaden stated that he had no idea what Coleman consumed nor when she consumed it.    While I was speaking with Jaden, I was approached by Randolph. Randolph stated that he was Colemans boyfriend and he wanted to speak with me. Randolph stated that he last saw Coleman between 1830-1900 hours when she returned from seeing her daughter and giving her a gift from their recent trip to Virginia Beach. Randolph stated that Coleman was with Heather Snow, when they returned to the residence. Randolph stated he then went to Federalsburg, Maryland and Easton, Maryland with Micheal Gross. Randolph stated that while he was in Easton, Micheal received a phone call from Heather stating that Coleman was hot and acting out of character. Randolph stated that while Heather was on the phone she became more animated and continued to say something was wrong. Randolph stated that he then took the phone from Micheal and told Heather to get the narcan and call 9-1-1 because Coleman was unresponsive at that point. Randolph stated that he and Micheal then drove back to his residence.    Randolph stated while he and Micheal were driving back, he continued asking Heather what happened. Randolph stated that Heather told him she was cleaning the house when Coleman walked to the back bedroom of the residence. Heather then stated that after not seeing Coleman for approximately 15 minutes she went back to the bedroom and found Coleman unresponsive. Randolph stated he continued asking Heather what Coleman took and she kept saying she did not know. Randolph stated he asked Heather where she and Coleman went earlier in the evening, Heather stated they went to Denton and met a woman at the McDonalds, then went to see Colemans daughter in Hillsboro. Heather told Randolph that she did not have any interaction with this woman. Randolph went onto state that Coleman is a recovering addict and he believes she relapsed approximately two weeks ago due to her demeanor changing. Randolph stated that someone needed to talk to Heather because he believed she knew where Coleman got the drugs and who she got them from.    It should be noted, while speaking with Randolph I was advised by a paramedic on scene that Coleman was pronounced deceased at 2200 hours.    Once my interview was complete with Randolph, I spoke to TFC. J. Griffin, who advised me that he spoke with Heather. Heather confirmed that she and Coleman went to Denton. Heather stated that while she was cleaning the house when Coleman disappeared for 10 to 15 minutes. Heather stated that she then went to find Coleman, and she could hear Coleman making random noises in the back bedroom of the residence. Heather stated that Coleman was leaned over, almost nodding off, so she walked outside and call Micheal to tell him what was going on. Heather stated that she was speaking to Micheal and Randolph over speakerphone and asked where the narcan was. Heather then went back inside and found Coleman to be unresponsive leaned over on a small television stand inside the bedroom. Heather stated that she ran to the kitchen, retrieved the narcan and gave Coleman two doses of it. Heather stated that while she was on the phone with 9-1-1 she was instructed on how to perform chest compressions and began doing them.    Shortly after my interviews were conducted Sgt. Nichols from the Caroline County Drug Task Force arrived on scene. I provided Sgt. Nichols with the information we had obtained up to that point and walked into the scene with him. When I entered the residence from the rear door, I walked through the kitchen and down the hallway to the right. Once at the end of the hallway I observed Coleman to be lying on the floor at the end of the bed. Colemans face was blue and purple, which led me to believe she was face down for a lengthy amount of time. I then observed a blue cut straw lying next to Colemans right hand and a small amount of powder residue on top of the small television stand previously mentioned. Further investigation of the residence resulted in the location of a pink cut straw on top of a television stand in a front bedroom of the residence. Sgt. Nichols later seized Colemans phone to further his investigation.    Nina Crist from Office of the Chief Medical Examiner responded to the scene and completed her investigation (OCME Case # 23-11489). Crist advised that she had contacted Fleegel and Helfenbein Funeral Home from Greensboro, Maryland to respond to the scene in order to transport Coleman to the medical examiners office. The funeral home arrived on scene at approximately 0015 hours (09/18/2023) and removed Coleman from the residence at approximately 0030.    S/Tpr. Hoffmeister then arrived on scene and conducted interviews of everyone involved. See his supplemental report for further information.    All evidence located was transported to the Maryland State Police - Easton I Barrack where it was later packaged and stored according to policy and procedure.    All events occurred in Caroline County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Initial Report </NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Evidence/Attachments:   OCME Autopsy Request form located in attachment section  Interviews were audibly and visually recorded with my body camera see Axon website for the interviews labeled under this case number23-MSP-032713.  Pictures of the scene were captured and uploaded to the attachment section.   Narrative:  On September 17, 2023, at approximately 2133 hours [09:33 p.m.], troopers assigned to the Maryland State Police - Easton Barrack were dispatched to 23990 Holsinger Lane Ridgely, Caroline County, MD, 21660 for the report of a suspected fatal overdose. Due to the nature of the incident, I, S/Tpr. Jeffrey Hoffmeister #6163 assigned to the Criminal Enforcement Division - Eastern Region (CEDER) responded to the scene.        Upon arrival, it was learned the victim, Katlyn Rae Coleman [hereinafter referred to as Coleman] (W/F, DOB: 04/30/1990) was found to be unresponsive. Coleman was found on September 17, 2023, at approximately 2045 hours [8:45 p.m.], by her friend identified as Heather Christine Snow [hereinafter referred to as Snow]. Coleman was pronounced deceased by Paramedic King of Paramedic 14 Ridgely EMS (EMS Run #33615) at approximately 2200 hours [10:00 p.m.].        I interviewed Snow who advised at approximately 1900 hours [07:00 p.m.] she was ogling to drive Coleman to her mothers house in Hillsborough Delaware, so she could drop off items to her daughter. Before heading to Colemans mothers residence, Coleman requested Snow to take her to an area called the Rocks in Denton. During this time, Coleman called Snake and later met with an unidentified black female; in which, Snow believes Coleman purchased drugs from the unidentified black female wearing a black shirt and shorts. Coleman and Snow later returned to the residence at 23990 Holsinger Lane Ridgely, Caroline County, MD, 21660 around 1930 hours - 2000 hours [7:30 p.m.- 8:00 p.m.]. Snow advised she was cleaning the house when she noticed Coleman in the back bedroom, leaned over nodding off. Snow asked Coleman if she was ok multiple times and Snow could hear Coleman making noises. Snow believed Coleman was just in a nod so she continued cleaning the house and washed herself up. Snow began to worry and went outside to call her boyfriend identified as Michael Ramon Grose Sr [hereinafter referred to as Grose]. Grose was out running errands with Colemans boyfriend identified as Randolph Fitchett [hereinafter referred to as Fitchett]. Snow told Grose what was going on and asked where the Narcan was within the household.When Snow went back inside she found Coleman to be cold, unresponsive, leaned over on a small stand inside the bedroom. Snow retrieved the Narcan and gave Coleman two doses. Coleman had Fitchetts son identified as Jayden Elijah Odell Fitchett [hereinafter referred to as Jayden] call 911 who at the time was in his room playing video games. Snow had Jayden retrieve frozen fruit out of the freezer. Snow placed the frozen fruit near Colemans groin in attempt to help her regain consciousness. Snow began to give Coleman chest compression until Grose, Fitchett and EMS arrived.    I spoke to Fitchett who corroborated most of the statements made by Snow. Fitchett advised that he left the residence with Grose to run errands around 1830 hours [6:30 p.m.] and advised Snow and Coleman initially left around 1700 hours [5:00 p.m.]. Fitchett advised while he was gone, he tried to call Coleman and Snow on their cell phones; however, neither were answering. Fitchett advised he then called his son Jayden who advised Coleman was in her room and Snow was in the bathroom. According to Fitchett, Coleman is a recovering addict (Heroin) and believes she relapsed within the past few weeks. Fitchett advised he had seen a change in the way Coleman was acting and even made her take an at home drug test recently which came back inconclusive.     I spoke with Jaydenwho advised he was playing video games the whole time in his room until Snow knocked on his door and asked him for assistance with Coleman. Snow asked Jayden to call 911 and helped Snow retrieve frozen fruit from the freezer to use on Coleman as Snow was performing CPR. Jayden corroborated the statements by Snow and Fitchett.    I spoke with Grose who was able to corroborate the statements by everyone else I interviewed.Grose advised that he left the residence with Fitchett to run errands around 1930 hours [7:30 p.m.] and advised Snow and Coleman initially left around 1830 hours [6:30 p.m.].    When entering the residence, I observed Coleman lying on her back on the floor in the back bedroom. Colemans face and lips were blue. Investigators conducted a preliminary examination of Colemans body and did not observe any signs of foul play. Coleman had slight lividity on her back. Coleman was wearing a camouflage shirt, red bra, and blue jeans. A frozen fruit bag and nearby fruits were located next to and around Colemans body. Colemans jeans were wet from where the frozen fruit bag was used. I surveyed the scene, which revealed multiple items indicative of illicit drug use to include: two cut plastic straws with suspected CDS residue. Two nasal dosages of Narcan spray were located near Colemans body. A cellular device was located that belonged to Coleman, which will be examined by members of the Caroline County Drug Task Force.        Forensic Investigator Nina Crist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME/ME #23-11489) responded to the scene, and it was determined Colemans body would be transported to the OCMEs Office for an autopsy. Fleegle and Helfenbein Funeral Home of Greensboro responded to the scene and transported the body.       Based on the above information, it is believed that the decedent died in an accidental manner subsequent to an overdose of a controlled dangerous substance. This case will remain open pending the autopsy report conducted by the OCME.    Case open, investigation continuing.</NarrativeText>
