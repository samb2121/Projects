         <NarrativeText>INCIDENT CAPTURED BY BWC  ATTACHMENTS:  Copy of MSP Form 63 Copy of MSP Form 67 Copy of Email Communication  COMPLAINANT:  John Wike, Assistant Resident Maintenance Engineer 150 Wyndtryst Dr Westminster, MD 21157 W/M DOB: 8/08/1965 jwike@sha.state.md.us  STATEMENT: Wike stated that he was made aware of found contraband at the MDOT SHA Westminster Shop on the afternoon of 9/14/2023. WIke advised that the contraband was found near the dumpsters at the facility. Wike stated that the area surrounding the dumpsters was cleaned and any debris of garbage was cleaned up by an employee in the morning of 9/14/2023. Wike stated that there should not have been any debris or garbage outside the dumpsters. Wike advised that Greg Stephan had located a white Royal Farms grocery bag that was sitting beside the dumpsters while depositing debris/garbage that he had picked up during his route at work. Wike stated that Greg had examined the contents and realized that it was possible contraband and that Greg had taken the property to Wike in his office. Wike also examined the items and thought it may be contraband that the work release personnel could have been coming to obtain. See BWC interview for further.  RECOVERED PROPERTY:  Eleven Rolls of tobacco cigarettes packaged in cellophane and black electrical tape.  NARRATIVE:    On 9/14/2023 at approximately 1637 hours, John Wike,Assistant Resident Maintenance Engineer, of the MDOT SHA Westminster Shop arrived a the MSP Westminster Barrack to turn over found contraband. I then collected the above-captioned statement.    After collecting Wikes statement, I then examined the contraband. Due to how it was packaged and with the guidance of Cpl. McCarty #6579, I opened one package to examine the contents. I determined the opened package to contain tobacco cigarettes.    I contacted Ronel Legrand of the DPSCS in reference to this investigation. Legrand advised that he has forwarded the information to the appropriate unit and requested that the evidence be destroyed locally.    All property was processed in accordance with MSP Policy and Procedure.  I request this case be closed due to a lack of investigative leads.  All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.

         <NarrativeText>Attachments: Chain of Custody Email Records Photographs  Victim: State of Maryland  Witness: Griffith, Alex State Highway Westminster Office 152 Wyndtryst Drive Westminster, MD 21157 410-848-6565  Witness Statement: On September 21, 2023, Alex Griffith explained that one of his shop personnel had located several packages of contraband located in the back parking lot of the shop area, next to a dumpster. The dumpster is used by the DCSPS Clean Up crews to discard the trash they collect from roadside daily. There was a similar occurrence on September 14th; however, Mr. Wike from the Shop brought the contraband to the Westminster Barrack. There has been a pattern to the contraband showing up, it usually appears on the grounds when the Frederick Crew is operating out of Westminster. The Frederick Crew is the inmates from Sykesville, Central Laundry, and are typically assigned to road clean up in Frederick, but have been recently been used for Westminster. The DCSPS Officer over seeing them is Officer Murray. No further information is known about Officer Murray or the inmates on the crew.  Suspect: Unknown  Narrative: On September 21, 2023, I (TFC Eckhardt #6469), was on duty and in uniform when I responded to the SHA Wesminster Shop located at 150 Wyndtryst Drive, Westminster, for a report of found contraband.  Upon my arrival, I made contact with the Shop Manager, Alex Griffith, who provided the above statement. There is no surveillance cameras on the property currently. It was discussed putting up trail cameras near the dumpsters in an attempt to capture who may be placing the contraband on the property.  Upon inspection of the contraband, it was determined it is six individually wrapped pouches of loose-leaf tobacco. These pouches are warped tightly in electrical tape. Three of the pouches were tapped together.  Griffith explained to me that a report was previously filed with MSP on September 14th for the same style of incident. Upon speaking with D/Sgt. McGee, it was determined that this incident would be a supplement to the original report. I took custody of the contraband and delivered them to the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack, where they were documented, packaged, and placed into evidence, all in accordance with MSP policy.  D/Sgt. McGee advised that DCSPS is already conducting an internal investigation regarding this case and requested me to contact Ronel Legrand from DCSPS to inform him of the new incident.  I sent an email to Mr. Legrand advising of the newly found contraband and sent photos of it as well. He advised that the evidence can be sent to be destroyed. The emails are attached to this report.  I respectfully request this case to be suspended.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
