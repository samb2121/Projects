         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-098 R NUTTER ID: 23-MSP-006277 Defendant: Brittanie Mae Nutter TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 18, 2023 at approximately 0030 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Maryland 43, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a blue Mitsubishi Outlander traveling above the posted speed limit and failing to drive within a single lane. The Mitsubishi was bearing Maryland registration 2EV1467.    Drove on dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  Mitsubishi began accelerating quickly.  Drove on dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  Left over dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  Mitsubishi was traveling 71 MPH in a 45 MPH speed zone.  Left over dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  The Mitsubishi was speeding throughout the duration of observation. The posted speed limit is 45 MPH. I paced the Mitsubishi by keeping an equal distance between the Mitsubishis rear bumper and marked patrol vehicle DUI-7s front bumper. During the pace, I did not increase distance between the Mitsubishis rear bumper and marked patrol vehicle DUI-7s front bumper. The Mitsubishis speed was observed at 71 MPH in a 45 MPH speed limit. Upon witnessing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Mitsubishi on Maryland 700 at Riverton Road.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Mitsubishi on the driver side and made contact with the female operator of the vehicle. There was a female passenger. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested her drivers license and vehicle registration. She was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Brittanie Mae Nutter. While speaking with Nutter, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Mitsubishi and requested Nutter to exit her vehicle. She complied and exited her vehicle. While speaking to Nutter outside of her vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. When asked about her consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Nutter stated she had one beer (Bud Light). Additionally, Nutter stated her last beer was approximately two hours prior to driving. When asked where she was driving from, Nutter stated she was coming from Avenue Tavern. I informed Nutter that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which she agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed in front of the Mitsubishi on Riverton Road. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. She appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. She was wearing a black jacket, jeans, and shoes.  I asked Nutter the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  Nutter stated she was wearing contacts.

At approximately 0053 hours, I placed Nutter under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. She was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for processing.
