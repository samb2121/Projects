         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera Defendant: Krystin Lee Thompson  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,000 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 3, 2023 at approximately 2350 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on westbound Eastern prior to MD 43, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a black Chevrolet Cruz bearing Maryland registration 9DT1674 following another vehicle very close and swerving. When the other vehicle changed lanes the Chevrolet continued to swerve left and right.    Left over dotted white line, right.  Left onto dotted white line, right.  Right on fog line, jerked left.  Left into left lane, right over dotted white line, driving on dotted white line.  Changed into right lane, over onto dotted white line.  Jerked left into left lane.  Left over solid white line, right.  Right over middle lane, onto dotted whit line.  Other vehicles in the area.   Accelerated to what appeared to be above clearly marked 35 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar (S/N: EG-02387), which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 65 MPH in a posted 35 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the Chevrolet prior to Orville Road.   The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. Training certificates and calibration records will be made available upon request. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Chevrolet on the driver side and made contact with the female operator of the vehicle, who was the only occupant in the vehicle. I explained the reason for the stop and requested her drivers license. She handed me her blue bank card and I had to tell her I needed her drivers license. She was identified by her Maryland drivers license asKrystin Lee Thompson.While speaking with Thompson, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. I deliberately observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Her speech was mumbled. She said that she was going not even a block away. I returned to my patrol vehicle and notified the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Chevrolet and requested Thompson to exit her vehicle and walk to the front. She complied and exited her vehicle. She stumbled left when exiting and missed her door. She stumbled right while walking and placed her right hand on her vehicle for balance when at the front. As I communicated with Thompson outside of the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. When asked about alcohol consumption she stated, I drove a couple drinks. She stated 4 vodka drinks at Tavern and started at 10 oclock. She I informed Thompson that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which she agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed at the location of the stop. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was lightly snowing. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. I observed her to be wearing a black zip up, black shirt, jeans and black shoes (tied).  I asked Thompson the following questions:  Glasses or Contact  Glasses Recent head injuries  No Medication  Medication for depression Problems with knees or ankles  No   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting Nystagmus    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes     She stumbled forward when facing towards me.  She had difficulty zipping her sweater up, unable.   WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Thompson stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Lost balance offline to the right 2 times.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 7, 8, 9 and 10.  Stepped completely offline on steps 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

Left foot hit the ground immediately.  Seconds 11-20:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from side for balance.  Right foot hit the ground immediately (fell left towards road).  PBT #209455 with a result of .13 BrAC.  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Thompson was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0005 hours, I placed Thompson under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Thompson was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Thompson with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Thompson listened to the DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. At 0035 hours, Thompson agreed to take a breath test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Thompson beginning at 0005 hours. A search of Thompson was conducted and it revealed that she had nothing in her mouth. Thompson was observed from that time until the time she submitted to the test and she did not put anything in her mouth. No piecings observed in her mouth. The test was conducted by Cpl. Dunlap of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Thompson had a result of 0.20 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0047 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****0.20 grams of alcohol****  Thompson was polite and cooperative, she was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
