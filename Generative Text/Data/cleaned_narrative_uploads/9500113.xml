         <NarrativeText>Attachments  -NCMEC Cybertip # }br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;  166245828    Narrative  On 7/14/23, the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Section /Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force received NCMEC CyberTip # }br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;  166245828. The Cyber Tip, generated by a citizen complaint, indicated that an adult male solicited minors online for nude images. The CyberTip was assigned to Senior Trooper Theodore Cooke #6272 for investigation.    The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the complainant:  Sarah Email: lunabutspooky@gmail.com IP Address: 77.111.246.42 Received by NCMEC on 07-13-2023 07:11:55 UTC    The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the suspect:  Relationship to Reporter: online friend years ago Name: Joshua Intano Address: 359 Old Chestnut Rd, Elkton, USA Elkton, MD MD 21921 US Mobile Phone: (410) 920-0973 Approximate Age: 20 Screen/User Name: unstablenebula Additional Information: has admitted to guilt  IM/Chat Name: unstablenebula Chat Service/IM Client: Snapchat  Additional Information: The alleged predator is named Joshua Intano and his residential address is Oldfield Acres, MD 21921, USA. I have screenshots of all the messages, recordings of voice messages, pictures of sexual content he sent (his penis) and a video of Joshua being confronted in real life andadmitting his guilt on camera. He interacted with a 13 year old online and asked the child for sexual images and texting. There were voice calls where Joshua acknowledges the childs age then continues to be suggestive towards her.    The CyberTip contained no reported child pornography files.   S/T Cooke contacted the complainant, Sarah, via her email. Sarah refused to speak with S/T Cooke over the phone but instead emailed the following:  I have little information about the victims as I am friends with them online. However the information I do have is as followed:  Victim 1: Name: Amlie Anna Vojtkov D.O.B.: 7th of January 2006 Address: Czech Republic Phone number/email: n/a  Victim 2: Name: Alena D.O.B.: 22nd of November 2007 Address: Ireland Phone number/email: n/a  I dont possess the victims contact information other than the social platforms I spoke to them on.  The attachments followed are pictures, audio and videos of evidence both victims had sent to me. Two of these contain explicit images from Joshua Intano. These incidents took place on Snapchat and Instagram. I was able to speak to the real life friends of Joshua Intano. Alena had spoken to them as well and forwarded the evidence to them. They confronted him around the beginning of July 2021 and Joshua Intano admitted to his contact with Alena on video.    Sarah emailed S/T Cooke multiple files including Snapchat and Instagram chat logs as well as two videos. The chat logs were not received in sequential order nor were they numerated or otherwise distinguishable as far as exact date/time. The chat logs content includes multiple conversations between the suspect, Joshua Intano, and two alleged 13-year-old females, Alena and Amelie, respectively. Within the chats, Intano acknowledges that he is communicating with a 13-year-old female and makes numerous statements regarding sexual fantasies involving the female. Intano repeatedly requests pictures of the female as well. The two videos show a group of unknown males confronting Intano at an apparent park. The males question Intano as to why he is chatting in a sexual manner and attempting to meet up with a 13-year-old female to which Intano initially denies but eventually admits to and apologizes for. It should be noted that the males make several harassing comments to Intano including calling him a faggot. There is no metadata associated with the date/time of these videos, nor is there any identifiable information regarding other males in the video.  All content provided by Sarah including the videos and screenshots of chat logs is retained on a digitally secure case folder.  A query through law enforcement databases shows a recent child sex abuse case involving Joshua Intano which was investigated by Detective Charles Dix of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office on 2/24/22. In summary, Intano was accused of raping a then 13-year-old female when he was 17 years old. The incident occurred on 10/29/20 but wasnt reported until 2/22/22. Intano was interviewed by Det. Dix in which he made numerous admissions of sexual involvement with the 13-year-old but ultimately denied having non-consensual intercourse. The case was forwarded to the Cecil County States Attorneys Office but no further action was recommended. S/T Cooke contacted Det. Dix (now Corporal assigned to road patrol) via agency email on 8/8/23 to obtain further details regarding this case. As of 8/14/23, Cpl. Dix has not returned a reply. Any forthcoming relevant information from Cpl. Dix will be attached to this report.  Due to the tenuous nature of the complaint (no method of verifying credibility, exact date/time, or victim contact), I request this case be suspended until further information is made available.  All events occurred in Cecil County, MD.    Case Status  SUSPENDED </NarrativeText>
