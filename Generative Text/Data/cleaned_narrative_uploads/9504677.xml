         <NarrativeText>MSP unmarked vehicle S-28 is equipped with a mobile recording device and the incident was recorded on body camera and in car camera.     Defendant: Cheryl Lynn Hamm Date of Birth: 08/11/1956 Date of Arrest: 09/29/2023 Times of Arrest: 2043 hours DUI #: 23-132 (Centreville Barrack)   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On 09/29/2023 at approximately 2013 hours, I, TFC Foley #6839 of the Maryland State Police - Centreville Barracks, was dispatched to the area of Peters Corner Road and Barclay Road, Templeville, Queen Annes County, Maryland for a single motor vehicle collision versus a stop sign and driving off-road.  Upon arrival, I observed multiple vehicles, including fire board and emergency medical services, and a silver 2012 Chevrolet Camaro bearing Maryland registration 4DH3487 with front end damage, stopped diagonally in the middle of the roadway blocking all lanes. I observed a white female standing outside the vehicle next to the Camaro with multiple Queen Annes County Medical personnel around her. I identified the white female as Cheryl Lynn Hamm (08/11/1956 W/F) by her Maryland drivers license.The Queen Annes medical personnel stated that Hamm was impaired and was very uncooperative with them while asking questions.   During my motor vehicle collision investigation, I identified the driver of the Camaro as Hamm, who statedshe was the driver of the Camaro and that she did not believe she struck anything and that the concerned caller was trying to get one over her.  The concerned citizen that called 911 was later identified as Johnny Lofland 2nd, who stated that he followed Hamm from Duhamel Corner Road at Busic Church Road intersection, towards Route 302 (Barclay Road). Lofland Stated that Hamm was swerving in her vehicle from shoulder to shoulder on the roadway. Lofland stated that Hamm was driving in the left lane (opposing traffic lane) and ran two cars off the road in the process. Lofland stated that he then passed Hamms vehicle, positioned his vehicle in front of hers and then began to slow her vehicle down by impeding her traffic until they came to a stop. Lofland stated after the vehicles were stopped he exited his vehicle and walked over to her vehicle and got Hamm to put her vehicle in park, then he took her vehicle keys and called 911. A copy of Loflands handwritten statement is attached to this report.  See the attached motor vehicle collision report in ACRS for additional details on the collision.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) When I made contact with Hamm, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. Her eyes had a reddish hue to them and her pupils were dilated. I asked Hamm if she had any alcoholic beverages to drink tonight to which she replied three (3) glasses of wine at a friends house.  I observed Hamms movements to be slow and lethargic. I observed that Hamm had a physical disability when she would walk. Hamm confirmed multiple times that she had countless surgeries to her hips and back. My shift partner provided Hamms information to the Maryland State Police Centreville Barracks. A routine MVA check revealed Hamm was a valid driver.  I informed Hamm that I wanted her to perform field sobriety tests, to which she consented.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed in the middle of Barclay Road, West of Peters Corner Road. Fire board and Queen Annes Emergency Medical Services kept the roadway closed during the tests. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 70 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of light from my emergency vehicles headlights and scene lights, and my flashlight. All emergency vehicles flashing lights that were in the immediate area were disengaged during testing. Hamm appeared to be in good physical condition other than the previous hip injuries and did not display any visible injuries from her incident that evening.  I asked Hamm the following questions:  Injuries  Multiple surgeries to her right hip/ back Medication - None Medical Conditions  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (REFUSED)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my right index finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Hamms eyes. She was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes until told to stop. She was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic and flashing emergency lights would not interfere with the test results. Hamms pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I asked Hamm if she understood the instructions, and she stated yes.  As I began the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test, Hamm kept her head and eyes facing forward at me and not at the test stimulus. I asked Hamm if she was going to follow the stimulus. Hamm stated no. I asked Hamm why not, and she stated I know what you Troopers do, do what you need to do. I offered Hamm the test once again, and she refused to cooperate.  WALK AND TURN (UNABLE TO COMPLETE)  Prior to Hamm performing the test, I began to properly explain and demonstrate how the test should be conducted. Hamm was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. Hamm was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in the position until told to begin. As I was explaining the test to Hamm, who stated that she can perform this test, she was unable to position herself in the starting position/ instructional position. I had to assist Hamm by holding her right arm/ hand to prevent her from falling over. I advised Hamm that she needed to complete this test un assisted by anyone. Hamm did not seem to be able to comprehend that information and began to argue with me that she can complete the walking portion, but I needed to hold onto her. For safety purposes, I did not allow Hamm to attempt this portion of the Standardized Field Sobriety Testing, concerned that she may fall to the ground and injure herself.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Could not maintain balance - Could not maintain balance and safely stay in the instructional/ starting position.   ONE LEG STAND (UNABLE TO COMPLETE)  Prior to Hamm performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. As I was explaining this portion of the test to Hamm, I stated to her that I did not feel comfortable with her attempting this portion of the testing as well, being concerned that she will fall to the ground.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Unsafe.    PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST  At the conclusion of the field sobriety tests, I offered Hamm a Preliminary Breath Test to which she refused.    ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Hamm was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   *Striking a stop sign at the intersection of Busic Church Road and Duhamel Corner Road with her vehicle. *Driving her vehicle through a soy bean field in the area of Busic Church Road and Duhamel Corner Road. *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. *Stating that she consumed three (3) glasses of wine that evening. *My observed signs of impairment as she performed field sobriety tests and during conversations with her. *PBT Refusal   I arrested Hamm for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2043 hours, and she was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. After being placed into my unmarked patrol vehicle, Hamm slipped out of one of the handcuffs and was verbally violent and uncooperative. Hamm was explained that being handcuffed was part of the procedure that involved being placed under arrest. Hamm eventually calmed down and complied. Hamm was then transported to the Centreville barracks for processing.At the Barracks, I read the English version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Hamm and provided a copy of the form for her to follow along as I read the form aloud to her. At the conclusion of the DR-15, I verbally repeated and reviewed the possible suspensions and sanctions that can be imposed by the MVA per the DR-15 form.  At the barracks, Hamm refused to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same at approximately 2132 hours.   INTOXIMETER RESULT:  ***REFUSAL***  Hamm was then transported to her residence located at 1601 Busic Church Road, Marydel, Maryland because she was unable to make contact with a friend or family member to retrieve her from the Centreville Barracks. Hamm was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released from custody at her residence. Hamm was aggressive and uncooperative throughout the process.  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
