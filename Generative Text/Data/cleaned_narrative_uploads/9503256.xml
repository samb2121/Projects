         <NarrativeText>VICTIM STATEMENT:   Lezley Cabrera contacted the Maryland State Police in reference to a subject distributing explicit photos of her when she was approximately 15-17 years old.  SCENE PROCESSING:    The interview was conducted in the Golden Ring Barrack and recorded on a Body Worn Camera.  NARRATIVE:    On 03/01/2023, at approximately 1622 hours, I made contact with Lezley at the Golden Ring Barrack. Lezley advised a subject from her InstaGram account, who utilizes the username yeah_its_ross, furthermore to be referred to as Ross, contacted her on 03/01/2023 at approximately 0959 hours. Ross advised Lezley that he was contacted on FaceBook by username Megan Cypress. Lezley advised she does not know Ross personally. Lezley advised Ross is a friend of friend on social media. Ross advised Lezley he was contacted through Facebook by username Megan Cypress. Lezley stated Megan requested a pictured of Lezley from Ross in exchange for exclusive photos of Lezley when she was a minor. Lezley advised she sent Ross a photo of herself to provide to Megan in an attempt to verify if there were in fact exclusive photos of her. Ross then received explicit photos from Megan and provided them to Lezley. Lezley confirmed the photos were of her when she was approximately 15-17 years old.Lezley advised Ross is assisting her with identifying who is harassing her and was reluctant to provide additional information on Ross.    I asked Lezley if there was anyone she was having problems with her and she advised no. I asked Lezley how anyone would have obtained the photos of her. She advised through her Snapchat account when she was younger. Lezley stated the exact photos provided by Ross were the photos she sent to an unknown person years ago. Lezley could not recall the username to the Snapchat account utilized by the subject who received the photos. At the time of this interview, Megan has not requested or demanded monetary gains. Lezley advised Megan did request additional explicit photos of her. Telegram is a messaging app that is being utilized by Megan to contact Lezley. Lezley came back into the Barrack and spoke to TFC Lora #7207 in reference to an image of another person who was sent. Her phone was subsequently seized and stored for investigation. See TFC Loras supplement for further.    I request this case remain open and be forwarded to CED for further investigation.    All events did occur in Baltimore County, MD.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>MSP Body-Worn Camera, Operational (Not Activated)  Narrative: On Wednesday, March 1st, 2023, at approximately 1800 hours, I (TFC. Lora #7207) was in the duty officers area when Lezley Jacklyne Cabrera (H/F 01/30/2002) abruptly entered the Golden Ring barrack. Cabrera appeared very emotional and immediately placed the white Apple iPhone on the counter. She informed me that she did not want to be a part of whatever was happening and that she had received a pornographic video on her Apple iPhone via Telegram (messaging app). I immediately reached for the phone and placed it on airplane mode to preserve all possible digital evidence from being wiped remotely. I explained to Cabrera that she needed to provide more information for an investigation to be adequately carried out. Cabrera was worried about the trouble she may cause to other involved persons. I explained to Cabrera that one of the purposes of our investigations is to determine who is involved in criminal activity. At that moment, Cabrera appeared calmer and began sharing more information. Cabrera mentioned a Monica Chica (U/F) whom she met in church at or about nine years ago. Although unsure, Cabrera believed Chica to be a youth teacher who plays basketball. Chica, who goes by the username of @mchicav on Instagram, friended Cabrera when she came of age via Instagram. Cabrera informed me that Chica has a connection with one of the alleged persons attempting to help her resolve this matter. I asked Cabrera if she had ever met any of the people she previously mentioned in person, to which Cabrera said, no, besides Chica. Cabrera also added that her parents know Chica from church. At that time, Cabrera was informed that it was necessary for her phone to remain in our custody to obtain more leads to pursue this case. Cabrera became worried that the persons involved in this case would find out that she was the one who brought the initial complaint to our attention. I expressed that it is our job to ensure we investigate properly without exposing her in such a manner. I obtained Cabreras iCloud account information and the Pin passcode for the Apple iPhone.  PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: The Apple iPhone referenced above was seized. The Apple iPhone was stored according to MSP policy and regulations and listed on the MSP Form 67 chain of custody. A Property Held has not been assigned at this time.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On March 3, 2023, Corporal Donald responded to the MSP Golden Ring Barrack to review the contents of CABRERAs phone. Corporal Donald located the screenshots of her conversation with ROSS and CYPRESS.Corporal Donald also located a conversation with ROSS in the application, Telegram. Telegram is an encrypted chat application that is housed overseas and does not respond to legal demands. During the conversation, CABRERA asks ROSS to send her $10.00 on February 19, 2023 for an unknown reason. On March 1, 2023,CABRERA asks ROSS, Who is Megan Cypress.CABRERA then messages ROSS, I know its the girl that you introduced me to. So I know you know who she is. During this time, CYPRESS begins messaging CABRERA via Facebook Messenger, treating to send CABRERAS illicit photos to all of her Facebook friends. Corporal Donald viewed the illicit photo, which was captured via screenshot by CABRERA. After review, Corporal Donald determined that this photo did not depict child pornography as defined by Maryland law.  On March 7, 2023, Corporal Donald contacted CABRERA to obtain additional information. CABRERA stated that she blocked CYPRESS, however she keeps receiving messages on her other social media accounts.  On March 9, 2023,CPL Donald transmitted investigative subpoena requests to the Cecil County Office of the States Attorney for ROSS and CYPRESSS account information.  Case remains open pending further investigation.</NarrativeText>
