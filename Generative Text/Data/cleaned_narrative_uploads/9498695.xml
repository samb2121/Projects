         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera Defendant: Taicha Michelle Silva  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,100 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On September 28, 2023 at approximately 0136 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on Loch Raven Blvd south of Joppa Road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a silver Nissan Rogue stopped in the right travel lane with hazard lights on. I made a U-turn and drove towards the Nissan. The Nissan pulled away and went onto the O/L I-695. I caught up to the Silver Nissan on the O/L and observed it to be swerving left and right over the dotted white line separating travel lanes. The Nissan continued to fluctuate speed. Accelerated away from my patrol vehicle at what appeared to be traveling above the posted 55 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar (S/N: EG-02387), which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 85 MPH in a posted 55 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). The Nissan swerved right on the dotted white line, left. Right on dotted white line, jerked left.Left over fog line on left shoulder. Half the vehicle on the left shoulder on the ramp for southbound I-83. Left on shoulder, right, left on shoulder, right. Left over fog line onto shoulder with  vehicles width. The Nissan was bearing Maryland registration 6FL8563. I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the Nissan.  The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. Training certificates and calibration records will be made available upon request. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Nissan on the driver side and made contact with the female operator of the vehicle. There was a young child in the rear seat. I explained the reason for the stop and requested her drivers license. She stated that she was not going 85 and did not drive on the shoulder. She was identified by her Maryland drivers license as Taicha Michelle Silva. While speaking with Silva, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. I deliberately observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. She continued to tell her son that it was okay and to sit back. He was not talking and he was sitting back the entire time. I returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  Due to Silvas demeanor on my initial contact, being argumentative about the stop and having her child in the vehicle, I requested the assistance from another Trooper. TFC White 6932 arrived at the scene.  I returned to the Nissan and requested Silva to exit her vehicle. She complied and exited her vehicle. As I communicated with Silva outside of the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. When asked about alcohol consumption she stated probably 89 oclock. I asked again and what she drank and she stated wine and beer. I asked what kind and she stated red wine and angry orchard. She stated that she started at 8/9 and stopped when she left. She picked her son up after being out drinking. I informed Silva that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which she agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed at the location of the stop. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests.   I asked Silva the following questions:  Glasses or Contact  Glasses (reading) Recent head injuries  No Medication - No Problems with knees or ankles  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting Nystagmus    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes     Looked away after being instructed to follow the stimulus.  Stated she does not drink often.    WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Lost balance offline to the right.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on step 5. Turn: Turned left, spun in one motion.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 2, 3, 5 and 8. Stepped completely offline on step 1.  ONE LEG STAND(1/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Balance and Count Stage:    Swayed body to the left and right for the duration of the test.  Left arm flailed twice to keep her balance.   Her speech was slurred when she was attempting to tell me her sons birthday (7 years old). Stated not a lot when asked about drinking PBT #209455 with a result of .10 BrAC. 1st: Blew too light the first time 2nd: Did not make a tight seal and blew out of the side of her mouth. 3rd: Barely blew, I pushed the button to capture a sample.  Silva was uncooperative at this time. I told her that she was under arrest, was explaining the process to her and how she could call someone to pick her up. She began walking towards her car and I stopped her. I then began explaining the process again, and she again started walking towards her car and the roadway. I was attempting to avoid placing her in handcuffs until she began walking towards the drivers door. For the safety of the child in the vehicle and the public, she was placed in handcuffs so she could not try and drive.  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Silva was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0158 hours, I placed Silva under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol.   Silva continued to pull away from me and began cursing at me. She sat in the rear passenger seat of her vehicle with her son until her boyfriend arrived on scene to pick the child up. She told her son that she doesnt have to be scared that we were chumps.  Silva was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Baltimore County Towson Precinct for processing.  Upon arrival at the station, I provided Silva with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Silva listened to the DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. At 0247 hours, Silva refused to take a breath test.  She continued talking over the form. I had to stop the form and tell her to continue listening to it.   I was trying to explain the form to her and she continued to talk over me and argue. She attempted to grab her drivers license out of my hand while I was explaining why her license was going to be suspended. She then ripped the DR-15A book out of my hand, tearing a piece of paper out of the book.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: Not applicable  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****Refusal**** Silva was not polite and cooperative.She was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
