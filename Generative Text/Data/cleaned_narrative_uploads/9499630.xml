         <NarrativeText>The incident was recorded on J-11 in-car camera and body-worn camera.    Scene Processing:     A document inside the suspects residence revealed his trueidentity.    Narrative:     On 08/09/2023 at approximately 1120 hours, I TFC. Hitch was on duty traveling southbound on I-97 in the area of exit 5 (Generals Highway). At that time, I observed a gray Buick Regal bearing a Maryland registration plate of 587Z97. The Buick was traveling directly in front of my unmarked patrol vehicle (J-11) in lane 3 prior to exit 5. I observed the Buicks front and rear right-side tires cross over the solid white line on 2 occasions. I began following the Buick and observed its tires cross over the solid yellow line for a 3rd crossing. I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle on Generals Highway off I-97. The vehicle came to a stop in the Exxon Gas station located at 1335 Generals Hwy, Crownsville, Maryland.      I made contact with the driver of the Buick. The driver was a white male with light brown hair, fair skin, a light beard/goatee, and was wearing a black long-sleeve shirt.I advised the driver of the reason for the traffic stop and while speaking with him, I observed that he was not wearing his seat belt. Thedriver provided me with a drivers license through Wisconsin (CAMPBELL, BRADLEY TYLER; WI -C5140788012105; DOB -04/01/1980; white male) but no vehicle registration card. I was able to immediately observe that the driver did not resemble the photo on the drivers license, and when I asked for his name. He was unable to give me the last name that was on the drivers license. When asked for his current address, the driver advised 42 Oak Court, Annapolis, MD 21409. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine MVA and METERs check.  As I was conducting the routine checks, thevehicle drove away and fled from the traffic stop. I did not pursue the vehicle and deactivated my emergency equipment. I then drove to 42 Oak Court, Annapolis, Maryland to see if the driver went home. I requested TFC. Tyler #6787 to respond alsoto assist me with locating the driver.     Upon my arrival at the address, I observed Anne Arundel County Police officers at the address as well. They were there to speak with a complainant who stated that one of his roommates stole his wallet. I met with the complainant, whom I identified asCAMPBELL, BRADLEY TYLER; DOB -04/01/1980. This was the same Campbell whose identification was used by the driver on my traffic stop. Campbell stated that he lived at 42 Oak Court, and that his roommate who he knew as Tony had stolen his wallet with his license and $311.00 in cash. I was later advised by Anne Arundel County officers that 42 Oak Court was a halfway house for people recovering from addiction, the halfway house funded by the government and run by Stepping Stone Recovery Houses.     Anne Arundel County Police officers asked Campbell if Tony had any identification in the house, Campbell allowed both Anne Arundel County officers and myself to come into the house. Campbell showed us a room that Tony shared with another resident. In that room on top of a desk, A photo of the driver that fled my traffic stop from earlier was located and identified the driver asPUCKETT, ROBERT ANTHONY (DE - 1607817; DOB - 11/04/1990; White Male). This information was relayed to the Glen Burnie Barrack, who then advised me that Puckett had a valid drivers license through Delaware, and had multiple warrants for his arrest. Campbell called Puckett on his cell phone (Pucketts cell phone - 443-924-0730). Puckett stated he would come back to the house, but never showed up. TFC. Tyler left the house to conduct patrol checks of the surrounding area. Campbell advised me that 2016 Industrial Drive, Annapolis was where Puckett would go for his AA meetings. Anne Arundel County Corporal Zoerman #2269 advised that they would handle the theft report from Campbell. I cleared from 42 Oak Court.      TFC. Tyler advised me that he had possibly located Puckett in the area of Bestgate Rd. and Industrial Dr.TFC. Tyler advised that he had located the Buick on Industrial Dr. off Bestgate Rd. TFC. Tyler advised me over the radio that there was a black Jaguar sedan that he believe Puckett had gotten into, and that the Jaguar was traveling northbound on Bestgate Rd. I located the vehicle, which had turned onto Trout Rd. off of Generals Hwy. The Jaguar turned around and appeared to be attempting to get back onto Generals Hwy, I was able to observe that Puckett was sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle, as I could see his face with my headlights. I activated my emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop on the Jaguar at whichtime it came to a stop on Trout Rd. Immediately upon stopping, Puckett jumped out of the passengers seat of the vehicle and began running down Generals Hwy. I attempted to run after Puckett, but Puckett ran into the woods off Generals Hwy and I lost him.      I returned to the Jaguar. TFC. Tyler had identified the operator of the Jaguar as PANESSA, FRANK JAMES (DOB - 10/08/1941; OLN - P520261367775). Panessa denied knowing anything about Pucketts criminal behavior and stated that Puckett had called him asking for a ride. Panessa was released from the scene. Further searches of the area were unsuccessful in locating Puckett.      I will be completing an application for the following charges on Puckett. *1_364* CR 8-301(c)(1) did knowingly and willfully assume the identity of CAMPBELL, BRADLEY TYLER  04/01/1980, to avoid identification, apprehension or for a crime, to wit: outstanding warrant. *1_0207* CR 9-501 did cause to be made a false [statement/report/complaint] to Trooper First Class #7051, a peace officer, knowing the same to be false, with the intent to deceive and with the intent to cause [an investigation/other action to be taken, to wit: arrest for outstanding warrant]. *1_4803* CR 9-501 did make a false statement (statement/report/complaint] to Trooper First Class Hitch #7051, peace officer, knowing the same to be false, with the intent to deceive and with the intent to cause an investigation or other action to be taken. *1_0043* Common Law did intentionally and knowingly obstruct and hinder a police officer, Trooper First Class Hitch #7051, in the performance of his lawful duties, in violation of the common law. *TA 21 904 b2*  attempt by driver to elude uniformed police by fleeing on foot. *TA 21 904 b3* attempt by driver to elude uniformed police by means other than failing to stop and fleeing on foot. *TA 21 904 c2* attempt by driver to elude police in official police vehicle by fleeing on foot. *TA 21 904 c3* attempt by driver to elude police in official police vehicle by means other than failing to stop and flee by foot.       All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  I request this case remain open pending an application of statement of charges.</NarrativeText>
