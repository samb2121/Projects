         <NarrativeText>NARRATIVE:  On January 13, 2023, at approximately 2045 hours, I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217) of the Maryland State Police, was dispatched to 573 Conowingo Road, Conowingo, Maryland in response to a domestic dispute. While en route, I was advised that the female party and her daughter both vacated the scene and went to Pennsylvania. As a result, I called both females and recorded the telephone conversation via body-worn camera. Both women were advised they were being recorded.    The first person I called was Skyler Smith (B/F; DOB: 04/11/2002). Skylers mother is Sandra Sninchak (W/F; DOB: 12/25/1963), and her step-father is Steven Adkins (W/M; DOB: 10/11/1973). Skyler told me she lives with Steven and Sandra. Skyler said Steven previously threatened to drive his pickup truck into their home, but did not make this threat during this incident. Skyler told me she was unharmed and en route to her girlfriends mothers house in Oxford, Pennsylvania (she did not give an exact address).    Skyler told me Sandra was also unharmed. She told me Sandra was en route to Morton, Pennsylvania. Skylar told me Steven did not put hands on Sandra.    Skyler told me she thought Steven was intoxicated during the incident. She said he backed over some garbage cans with his truck in the driveway of their home. I advised Skylar on how to apply for a peace order against Steven. She proceeded to tell me she believed Steven had since gone to bed.    After speaking to Skyler, I called Sandra. I gathered from Sandra that she, Steven, and Skyler have lived together for some time. Sandra told me no one was harmed during the incident. She said she and Skylar did not have injuries and no physical altercation occurred between the involved individuals. Sandra told me Steven may have been intoxicated during the incident, which, according to her, occurred approximately two hours prior to our conversation (the telephone conversation between us occurred at approximately 2117 hours). Sandra said at some point Steven took off in his pickup truck. However, he returned at some point before Sandra and Skyler left.    Sandra elaborated that she did not view the incident as an argument. She advised she is unsure what set Steven off, but he simply said he wanted to leave before he left their house in his truck. To reiterate, he returned later before Sandra left. Sandra claimed Steven did not damage anything and that he did not threaten to drive his vehicle into their house. She also said Steven did not make any threats against himself or another as far as she is aware. I advised Sandra how to apply for a peace/protection order against Steven.    Between speaking with both Sandra and Skyler, I gathered both women planned on staying in Pennsylvania for the night.    At approximately 2142 hours, I arrived on scene at 573 Conowingo Road to check on Stevens welfare (considering Sandra and Skyler both claimed no physical altercation occurred). I observed a black Ram 1500 pickup truck (Maryland registration 3EF0065). The vehicle was backed into a space in the driveway. I noticed some garbage cans were knocked over. Steven answered the door to the residence shortly after I knocked.    I noticed Steven appeared to be intoxicated when he spoke to me. However, I took into consideration that the incident with Steven allegedly occurred two hours prior to my contact with Sandra, and from what I could gather from Sandra, Steven was at home when Sandra and Skyler left. Based on what Sandra told me regarding the time frame, this would place the incident as having occurred at approximately 1917 hours.    Steven went on to tell me that no physical alteration occurred. He told me he was okay. He said he felt depressed leading into the incident, but wasnt very clear on exactly why. He told me he was not thinking of harming himself or another. Steven did have some cuts on the knuckles of his left hand, but he advised this came from punching his television.    I offered Steven medical attention for his hand, but he declined. Steven told me he called his brother to come and pick him up from his house. I ordered Steven not to drive and advised him to allow his brother to pick him up from his house. He closed the door to his home and remained inside when I left.    Considering the above, this incident appears to be a verbal domestic dispute.    Case closed.    All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
