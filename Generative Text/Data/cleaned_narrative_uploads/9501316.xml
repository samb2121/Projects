         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>This investigation was recorded via Body Worn Camera.  Physical Evidence:  Two screenshots of the attempted extortion.  Narrative:  On December 21, 2023, at approximately 1758 hours, I was on duty, in uniform, operating unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle, T-9. I responded to the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack located at 23200 Leonard Hall Drive, Leonardtown, Saint Marys County, MD 20650 for a report of an extortion.  Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant who was identified as Antonio Quenton Rivers SR (B/M DOB: 06/21/1975). Rivers stated an unknown person was sending him text messages through an email address stating if he did not pay them $300.00 they would send explicit pictures of him to his family and friends and ruin his life. Rivers stated the person sending him the extortion texts were from an email of marymoody509@gmail.com. He stated they wanted him to send the money through PayPal to an email of ierchespzoa@hotmail.com. Rivers again stated he did not know who this person was. Rivers said this had all started earlier in the day at around 1600 hours when he was driving home from work. Rivers stated a woman who had been talking to for several months also began sending him messages through the social media platform Instagram stating she was receiving the same threats.  Rivers stated this womans name was allegedly Nicolette James who is twenty-eight years old and lives outside of Richmond, VA. He stated he randomly met her through Instagram in February, and they have been talking since. Rivers provided a phone number he had previously texted James through which was 321-697-9666. Upon trying to call that phone number it returns to a 911 only phone. Rivers stated he hasnt communicated with James through an actual phone number in a while but only Instagram. Rivers stated at one point in the past he had sent explicit pictures to James through text and Instagram, but they had all since been deleted. He stated James had also sent him explicit pictures which he stated were deleted as well. I asked Rivers to bring up Jamess Instagram account to see if there was any further information on her. Upon looking at her Instagram page, it appeared private and had no other images of her. There again is no other information on this alleged Nicolette James. During this time, James continued to send messages to Rivers on Instagram stating she would harm herself if her pictures got released and telling Rivers he needed to do something. Upon looking at some messages sent by James it did not appear to be sent by someone who was twenty-eight years old as there were a lot of simple grammar mistakes that someone who spoke English as a primary language would not make. Along with this and there being no other information on James, I informed Rivers that James might not be who he thinks she is. I informed him there are scams with people from foreign countries where people pretend to be someone else in an effort to extort money.  Rivers said he did not understand how the person trying to extort him would have gotten the explicit pictures he sent to James through Instagram and text as he only sent them to her. I explained to him that whoever James is would more than likely be the one who provided those images as they are part of the extortion scam. I informed him James likely continues to send him messages on Instagram to try and make him feel bad and bait him into sending the money. Rivers also stated the random email was sending him images of people he did not know. Rivers was informed to block the email sending him numbers and I also recommended he block James as she is more than likely not who she says she is. It should be noted up to this point Rivers had not sent any money or lost any money. Rivers stated he would be going to T-Mobile to try and see if they could help him with anything.  I request this case remain open pending further investigation.  All events occurred in Saint Marys County, MD.  </NarrativeText>
