         <NarrativeText>*Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack* Vehicle: Blue Unmarked Ford Explorer B-69 Body Camera Equipped and Functioning: Yes In-car Camera Equipped and Functioning: No  ATTACHMENTS: Photos of damage to vehicle MSP 67 for print  COMPLAINANT: IKER SANTOS 8/31/03 STATEMENT: IKER stated that he had parked his mothers Hyundai in its usual spot at the corner of Spring Dr and Glade Bvld at approximately 2100 hours on 7/6/23. IKER stated that the suspects had broken the back window and damaged the steering wheel to the point that it could not be driven. IKER informed me that nothing had been taken from the vehicle. IKER also informed me that he had opened the vehicle prior to my arrival but had not touched the drivers side glass/window when he had opened it. IKER informed me that the vehicle is registered in his mothers name but that he is the only one that drives is. IKER also informed me that he normally does not touch the glass/window when he opens or shuts the car door.  VICTIM: LILIAN SANTOS CRUZ 12/23/87  SUSPECT: Unknown  SCENE PROCESSING: Upon arrival, I followed IKER toward the vehicle in question, a silver Hyundai Elantra bearing MD 3FA3018. The Hyundai was parked at the corner of Spring Dr and Glade Blvd. While walking around the vehicle, I observed that the rear passenger side window had been busted out and shattered (See Attachments). I observed glass on the ground outside of the vehicle as well as inside the vehicle. I then observed from the passenger side, that the steering column of the Hyundai appeared to be damaged. Upon closer inspection, I observed that the plastic casing around the steering colum had been opened (See Attachments). I also observed on the floor mat of the drivers seat, components of the key ignition (See Attachments). I also observed that the key ignition appeared to be heavily damaged/scratched (See Attachments).  I made contact with the residents of 100 Glade Blvd. 100 Glad Blvd is located at the corner of Glade Blvd and Spring Dr and right next to where the victim vehicle had been parked.The occupant there was able to review security footage over the previous evening. 100 Glade Blvd has a camera located in the driveway as well as a doorbell camera. Both cameras point in the direction of Spring Dr and Glade Blvd. The victim vehicle is just outside the driveway camera view. While reviewing the footage, the driveway camera was activated at approximately 0150 hours on 7/7/23. At the start of the short clip, a loud audible breaking/cracking sound can be heard. I believe this is when the victim vehicle was broken into. However, nothing else of note and no movement is captured in the clip, just the audio of the window breaking.  While inspecting the vehicle again, I observed that there appeared to be a partial fingerprint located at the top right corner of the drivers side window. Above the partial print, I observed large smudges that appeared to have been left by the palm of a hand, likely when shutting the door. I then made contact with MSP Crime Scene Tech (CST) Kortchak. CST Kortchak advised she would be willing to respond to process the scene, however she may have an extended arrival time. Ultimately, I advised CST Kortchak I would attempt to process the scene and lift the print. A short time later, TFC Key arrived on scene to assist. I was ultimately able to lift the single partial print.  I later transported the print to the Frederick Barrack where it was packaged and processed in accordance with MSP policy and procedure (See Attachments).  NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK: I made contact with occupants of 100 Glade Blvd in regards to this case (See Scene Processing). I also made contact with the town home directly across from the victims vehicle, 18 Gallorette Ct. They informed me they had not heard or noticed anything suspicious over the evening/early morning.  I drove around the neighborhood attempting to locate any additional vehicles that had been broken into.  NARRATIVE: On 7/7/23 at approximately 0822 hours, I, TFC Meyers, was dispatched to 11 Gallorette Ct Wakersville MD, for report of a vehicle break in. Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant IKER SANTOS. IKER provided the above statement/information. While on scene, I also inspected IKERS vehicle (See Scene Processing). While on scene, I took photos of the vehicle that had been broken into.  After providing IKER the case number, I then made contact with the occupants of 100 Glade Blvd. 100 Glade Blvd is right next to where the victims vehicle was parked. I also observed that 100 Glad Blvd had a security camera in the driveway facing the direction of the vehicle in question. See Scene Processing for observations from the security camera. I then drove around the neighborhood but did not observe any additional vehicles that had been broken into. I then returned to the vehicle and continued to inspect it. During this time, I observed what appeared to be a small partial print on the drivers side window.  I then made contact with MSP CST Kortchak in regards to my case. Ultimately, due to an extended arrival time, I processed the scene with the assistance of TFC Key and was able to lift a single partial latent print from the window. The print was packaged and processed in accordance with MSP policy and procedure (See Attachments).  All above events occurred in Frederick County, MD.  I request this case remain open.</NarrativeText>
