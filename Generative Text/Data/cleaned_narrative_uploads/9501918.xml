         <NarrativeText>Malicious Destruction of Property (MDOP)   Case #: 23MSP036348  Scene Processing:  A state vehicle was damaged/vandalized while parked in an apartment parking lot located at 104 Brubar Court, Baltimore, Maryland 21207. No available video surveillance in the area. A witness statement was taken from Daquane Washington (DOB: 06/13/1994). Photographs were taken of the damage to the vehicle.  Suspect:  Unknown  Victim(s):      Daquane Malik Washington (DOB: 06/13/1994)     104 Brubar Ct 4D Baltimore, MD, 21207  (443) 863-0048      Maryland Department of Transportation     Vehicle:  MD tag - SG84058  2013 Ford F450  Vehicle Owner:  Maryland Department of Transportation Company  10690 Red Run Blvd, Owings Mills, MD 21117  Charges:  CR 6-301: Malicious Destruction of Property (Less than $1000)  Narrative:  On October 16, 2023 at approximately 1130 hours, I, Trooper Stallings #7589 responded to 10690 Red Run Blvd, Owings Mills, MD 21207 for the report of malicious destruction of property (MDOP) to a state vehicle. The MDOP was reported to have occurred in a parking lot located at 104 Brubar Ct Baltimore, MD, 21207 between October 13, 2023 at 0430 hours and October 16, 2023 at 0630 hours.  Upon my arrival at the State Highway Administration building, I made contact with the complainant/victim who was later identified to be Daquane Malik Washington (DOB: 06/13/1994). Daquane then provided me with a written statement and verbal explanation of what occurred.  Daquane explained that on October 13, 2023 at approximately 1615 hours, he was traveling home in his take home vehicle on Liberty road just prior to Brubar Court when he stopped at a crosswalk for a pedestrian. Daquane then stated that he heard a collision behind him, which prompted him to get out of his vehicle and see what happened. Daquane stated that he then realized a two vehicle collision occurred directly behind him. He then checked on the welfare of both parties involved. Daquane advised me that the driver of the vehicle that rear ended the other vehicle directly behind his vehicle, was extremely mad at him, yelling at him and blaming him for the collision. Daquane then got back in his vehicle and drove home, which was approximately 200 feet up the road from the collision.  On October 16, 2023 at approximately 0630 hours, Daquane was getting in his vehicle to go to work when he saw a note on his windshield and realized the exterior mirrors to his vehicle were damaged. See attachment tab for images of the note and vehicle damage.  Daquane believed the driver involved in the two vehicle collision that blamed him for the collision, sought out his vehicle at a later time and left the note and damaged the mirrors. Daquane couldnt give me a description of the suspects vehicle and could only describe the driver as a middle-aged African American woman. Daquane advised that he never identified the woman and/or got her name.  Daquane was provided a case number and a victim/witness pamphlet.  Exhibit:      Images of vehicle damage      Note left by suspect      Written statement from Daquane Washington     Follow up:  In an attempt to identify the suspect, I contacted Baltimore County Police dispatch in the hopes that the two vehicle collision was reported. After speaking with dispatch, I learned that they did not receive a call or report of a two vehicle collision in that area, at that time.Which means no officer was dispatched to the scene and the drivers involved in the collision were never identified. This then prompted me to try and obtain video surveillance, however, I learned that there is no viable surveillance in the area of where the incident occurred.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  I request this case be considered closed due to lack of leads. </NarrativeText>
