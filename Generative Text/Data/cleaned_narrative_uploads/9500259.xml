         <NarrativeText>  On July 21, 2023, I was contacted by FedEx corporate security regarding a potential fraud case. In speaking with security I was provided with a package that contained two Green dot cards, the cards or brand new, and still attached to the paperwork that they were mailed with, both of the cards had the name Timothy Simon who resides in Marietta Georgia. I was able to contact Mr. Simon around 8 PM and speak with him regarding the cards. He informed me that these cards were being shipped to his cousin in West Virginia. After speaking with him for an extended period of time, he informed me that he previously was scammed out of $48,000. He informed me that the cards were addressed to his cousins wife, and he was sending them the cards to help them out. He stated there was no money on the cards however, he was sending them to his cousin, so he could put money on them himself. I questioned this as I believed, Mr. Simon was being scammed as this story did not make sense.     In speaking with Mr. Simon, I was able to obtain a phone number for his daughter who he referred to as Mimi. Following my conversation with Mr. Simon,I contacted his daughter as Mr. Simmons story, did not match up.   In speaking with Mimi, she informed me that her father is vulnerable to scams, and this was part of a scam. She stated this was not a relative even though her father told me that she would not know the cousin.     Mr Simons phone number is 404-444-2859. Mimi phone number is 404-538-1403. The individual who Mr. Simon informed me that he considered a cousin was John White with a phone number of 205-671-1953. I attempted to call this number on 7/24/2023, and I received no answer and there is no voicemail for this number.  At this time I have attempted to contact Ms. Mimi and I did not receive an answer. Once I speak to her, I will determine what can be done with the Green dot cards. At this time this case remains open.   </NarrativeText>
