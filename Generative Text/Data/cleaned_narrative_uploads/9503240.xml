         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-007611e  Time of Occurrence: 01/16/2023 at 0721 hours   Victim:  Janet Catherine Bowman W/F DOB 10/30/1941 Address: 210 Kennard Ave, Edgewood MD 21040 Phone # 410-676-1798 MD DL SDX B-550-368-108-835  Suspects: Unknown Suspect   Criminal Charges: CR 7-104, Theft $25,000 to $100,000 CR 7-104 Theft Scheme $25,000 to $100,000  Scene Processing: Copies of the conversations between the victim and online scammer from Facebook messenger, as well as receipts of the victim paying for the shipping via UPS.   Attachments: Attachments for the report include the documentation of the paperwork above.    Narrative  On 02/28/2023 at approximately 1639 hours, I was dispatched to 210 Kennard Ave in Edgewood for a potential fraud case. Upon my arrival I met with Janet Bowman (W/F DOB 10/30/1941). Bowman advised that she was scammed out of a large amount of currency after following the direction of a supposed government agent she was talking to on Facebook messenger. Bowman presented printed out conversation she had with a person impersonating her cousin. The account was labeled as Joe Stanley who Bowman recognized as her cousin and even stated that the profile photo matched her cousins real Facebook account. The conversation started on January 16th of 2023 at approximately 0721 hours. Over multiple days, Stanley informed Bowman of a Federal funding program that would send financial aid to needy families. Stanley stated that the program offered up to $500,000 to relieve low income households. Bowman stated that because she believed this to be her actual cousin, she requested where she would apply. Stanley then provide a link to a supposed agent for the program which led Bowman to a Facebook profile of the agent. After Stanley provided the information, he sent several more messages stated that Bowman should keep in touch with the agent. Bowman did reach back out to Stanley to ask about processing fees for the program, which Stanley did provide instructions that she was supposed to pay those fees and that she should receive the financial aid after. Stanley would always end his messages directing Bowman to keep in touch with the agent.  The supposed agent was labeled as Kendrick Paul; Paul requested that Bowman send her personal information to him to see if she qualified for the grant. The information he requested included her name, address, phone number, gender, email address, age, marital status, occupation, monthly income, and disability. Bowman provided all information to Paul and Paul stated that she qualified for the grant and provided her the case number. The case number Paul provided to Bowman was AS17254, Package ID- Grant/56337, Application number- 983301MA, and reference number BE6006/85428. During the conversation Paul also instructed Bowman to not share information regarding the grant with anyone until she received the grant money. However, Paul instructed Bowman that she was supposed to pay $1300 prior to the grant money being delivered. Paul also suggested that Bowman attempt to use Amex gift cards and stated that this was the fastest way to confirm the payment. Bowman at first suspected that the situation was a scam, but was convinced to follow through by Stanley. Paul then directed Bowman to send him the $1300 in cash and ship it to an address in a brown envelope. The shipping information Paul provided was addressed to Shirley Lane Durham at 600 Norris Ct, Lincoln CA 95648. Paul explicitly continued to say that Bowman needed to overnight the shipment. Bowman provided a receipt to me from the UPS store where she shipped the cash which is dated for February 9th 2023, which is attached to the report.  Paul continued to message Bowman to assure contact, and then stated that she would be receiving her grant money which would be escorted by a private security team. The security team would provide assurance to the safety of Bowmans grant money. Paul then instructed Bowman that she would need to pay $8200 for the security detail. Paul instructed for Bowman to send $8200 in a similar fashion to the first and to address it to Hilda Villareal at 2815 Cypress Point apt 8105, Missouri City Texas 77459. The receipt from the UPS store for this shipment is attached to the report.  On February 13 at approximately 1143, Paul informed Bowman that she would need to pay a $20,500 insurance fee that would be given back to her after receiving her grant money. Paul instructed Bowman to send the money to 1814 W Farewell Ave, APT 3 Chicago IL 60626. Paul also instructed that this particular payment should be sent in a large brown box. However, Bowman had issue with the UPS store due to not having a name for the address. Paul then changed the address to Jacquelyn Witherspoon at 108 Jessup St. Lexington NC 27292, he also instructed that a signature would be required and it would need to be overnighted. A receipt for this shipment is also attached to the report.  On February 18th Paul sent Bowman a message stating that her grant money was stopped by the Tax Clearance officer, and in order for the officer to clear the release, Bowman would have to send $15,500.00 to him. Bowman responded to this message stating that she only had a remaining $4000 which Paul stated that would suffice. Paul stated that Bowman would have to send the cash to Jacquelyn Witherspoon to 108 Jessup St. Lexington NC27292.  Paul then messaged Bowman that she would need to send an additional $6000 in order to complete the $10,00 payment. Bowman refused and Paul attempted to convince Bowman to send the money for some time. Bowman stopped replying to Paul on February 26th.  According to the messages, Bowman sent approximately $34,000 to Paul at the various addresses. Bowman stated that she has not noticed any illegal activity on any bank accounts or received any notices that her identity has been compromised at the time of writing this report. Bowman did notice a charge on her credit card for approximately $21 but has since cancelled her Visa and Master card. The Mastercard number is 535807820-1889-9989 and the Citi Visa card is 4100-3904-7512-6054. I instructed Bowman to keep an eye on her banking information and Credit as well as no longer replying to Paul or the fake Stanley account.  All events occurred in Harford County MD.  I request this case be forwarded to CED for further investigation.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Since the last supplement, Troopers reviewed four (4) Facebook accounts to attempt to identify suspect information and addresses where the funds were sent by the victim. Troopers also located several addresses that were used by the suspect(s) to receive the proceeds of the fraud. These addresses were located in Senior Living Apartment and single family residences where the homeowner is an elderly citizen. Attempts to contact the homeowners yield negative results.  Troopers conducted additional research on these types of fraudulent transactions/crimes and found that during the beginning of 2023 a multitude of people across the United States were victims of these crimes. No other additional investigative leads were developed during the course of the investigation. Facebook did not yield information of evidentiary value.  Case suspended.</NarrativeText>
