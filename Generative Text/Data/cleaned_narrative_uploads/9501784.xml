The Duty Officer advised the driver to open Google Maps on his phone, there were multiple locations given at first.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (Phase 1)  At approximately 0301 hours, I, Trooper Reid #7458 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Forestville Barrack (Marked MSP patrol vehicle L-27). Responded to the scene. Upon my arrival I observed a blue Toyota Corolla bearing Virginia registration UYH8584 on the right shoulder with its hazard lights on.   PERSONAL CONTACT (Phase 2) Upon my initial approach to the passenger side, I observed that a tire was missing from the front right passenger side of the vehicle. The driver appeared to be driving on the rim for an unknown period of time. There was no tire on the rim. I also observed the key in the ignition and the vehicle engine was still running. The driver advised me he dialed #77 and was waiting for someone to help him. While communicating with the driver I immediately detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the drivers vehicle and person. I asked the driver if he had consumed any acholic beverage prior to operating the vehicle. The driver stated No.  I advised the driver to furnish his drivers license. The driver was identified by his Virginia drivers license (A61398436) as Joshua Rafailano H/M, DOB 03/25/1995. While communicating with Rafailano I observed his speech to be slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and watery, Rafailano displayed behaviors of a driver impaired by alcohol. I requested Rafailano to perform the Standardize Field Sobriety Tests at which time he agreed.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (Phase 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of Northbound I-495. The surface was dry, level and free from any debris. The weather was clear. My patrol vehicle forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Rafailano appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.    Rafailano was asked the following questions: Glasses or Contacts - No Medical Conditions - No Injuries - No Medication - No   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6 of 6 clues observed) The first test was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Rafailano eyes. Rafailano was instructed to look straight ahead keep his head still while focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only. Rafailano was instructed to follow the tip of the pen with his eyes only until told to stop. Rafailano pupils were of equal size and showed equal tracking. Rafailano was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the results.    335552541:1,335559683:0,335559684:-2,335559685:720,335559991:360,469769226:Symbol,469769242:[8226],469777803:left,469777804:,469777815:hybridMultilevel}" data-listid="1" role="listitem"&gt;  Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes    335552541:1,335559683:0,335559684:-2,335559685:720,335559991:360,469769226:Symbol,469769242:[8226],469777803:left,469777804:,469777815:hybridMultilevel}" data-listid="1" role="listitem"&gt;  Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes    335552541:1,335559683:0,335559684:-2,335559685:720,335559991:360,469769226:Symbol,469769242:[8226],469777803:left,469777804:,469777815:hybridMultilevel}" data-listid="1" role="listitem"&gt;  Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes    335552541:1,335559683:0,335559684:-2,335559685:720,335559991:360,469769226:Symbol,469769242:[8226],469777803:left,469777804:,469777815:hybridMultilevel}" data-listid="1" role="listitem"&gt;  Vertical gaze nystagmus present      Walk And Turn (5 of 8 clues observed) Prior to Rafailano performing the test, I clearly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed twice.

         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-039679 Supplement  My body camera recorded this incident.     On 11/10/2023 at approximately 1143 hours, I, Tpr Strawser #7677 responded to ANA towing located at 7820 Marlboro Pike, Forestville MD, Prince Georges County in reference to a firearm found in the vehicle of Joshua Rafailano (Blue Toyota bearing VA registration: UYH8584) who was arrested for DUI on 11/10/2023 and towed to ANAs tow lot.    Upon arrival, I met with ANA employee, Glen Royoll (B/M DOB: 8/14/1967 P# 301-736-7704) who advised he was doing an inventory of Rafailanos vehicle on 11/10/2023 at approximately 1115 hours when he observed a firearm in the vehicle. Royoll stated he observed the firearm to be in between the drivers seat and the drivers door. Once in the vehicle, I observed a tan handgun tucked between the drivers seat and drivers door on the floor of the vehicle, it was later identified as a Glock 19x (Serial# BRPY233) and was within a black holster. I observed the chamber to be clear, and a magazine inserted into the firearm, there were thirteen 9mm rounds inside the magazine. A search of the vehicle rendered no further items pertaining to the firearm or other contraband.    Maryland Gun Center was notified, and I made contact withInvestigator Mike Barclay #7557 who advised the firearm from above was not stolen and unregistered in Maryland. I submitted the firearm into MSP evidence. Maryland Gun Center reports, evidence forms, witness statement, and pictures the firearm were uploaded to RMS.  All of the above events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText> On November 10, 2023, TPR C. Reid #7458 of MSP Forestville Barrack contacted Joshua Isia Rafailano (DOB 03/25/1995) of Woodbridge, Virginia as the operator of a disabled vehicle in the area of the Capital Beltway and Pennsylvania Avenue, Upper Marlboro, Prince Georges County, Maryland. Based on Tpr Reids observations and investigation, Rafailano was arrested for DUI. Rafailano was transported to Prince Georges County Department of Correction where he was seen by a commissioner and released on recognizance. Tpr Strawser #7677 responded to ANA Towing, Upper Marlboro, Maryland, to contact tow lot employee reference a firearm being found in Rafailanos vehicle during an inventory conducted at the tow lot. The firearm was identified as a loaded Glock 19x 9mm SN: BRPY233. A check was conducted through the Maryland Gun Center and no additional information was located regarding the firearm. Rafailano was found to not be prohibited from possessing firearms.   On November 15, 2023, I, ST S. DiToto #5416, contacted D/Sgt C. Bowling and Tpr Reid regarding their investigative efforts. It was determined no additional criminal indicators had been observed and a summons was issued and assigned to Prince Georges County Sheriffs Office for service. Troopers had no further contact with Rafailano since he was placed in the custody of PGDOC for the DUI violation. I contacted Rafailano via telephone (703-307-8389) on November 15, 2023 at approximately 1450 hours. Rafailano identified himself and was cooperative. Rafailano stated he was traveling from DC to his home in Virginia on I-495 when his vehicle became disabled and he called for assistance. He stated at the time he was carrying his loaded firearm in his vehicle for personal protection. He advised that after his release he contacted the Barrack to verify his firearm had been recovered and not stolen or lost. Rafailano stated the firearm was purchased legally by him in Virginia. He advised he possessed a Virginia Conceal Carry permit, but he did not possess a Maryland Handgun Permit. Rafailano advised he was not involved in any criminal activity. Rafailano stated he possessed the firearm case and paperwork at his residence and was able to verify the serial number and description of the handgun. Rafailano was advised of his active summons, the date/time of his preliminary hearing, and he was instructed to contact the Prince Georges County Sheriffs Office to facilitate service of the summons. No further information of value was obtained during the interview. No leads were developed and Tpr Reid was notified of the assistance provided. An OTS Test Fire will be conducted at a later date. Case closed.  Above events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
