         <NarrativeText>This incident was recorded, H-8 equipped with an in-car camera system, TFC Husseys and Tpr. Hughes body camera.  Defendant: Shaw, Jacob Ian-Tyler  Date of Birth: 09/28/1992  Location: Northbound Route 301, north of Acton Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601  Drivers License #: MD S000356326749  DUI #: 23-038  2ndDUI  .12 BrAC  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  NARRATIVE/ VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):  On 02/27/2023 at approximately 2000 hours, I, Tpr. Hughes #7578 and TFC Hussey #6913 (FTT) with the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack were dispatched to a motor vehicle collision located at northbound Route 301, at Acton Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601. Upon my arrival, I observed a silver Honda Civic bearing Maryland registration (5EP7675) in the right turn lane, northbound Route 301, north of Acton Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601 with the driver and passenger standing outside of the vehicle. The vehicle had heavy front end/drivers side damage.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  I asked the driver for his drivers license and registration card, which he displayed. I identified the driver by his Maryland Drivers License as Shaw, Jacob Ian-Tyler, W/M, DOB: 09/28/1992. While speaking with Shaw, I observed he had a slurred speech. I observed Shaw had bloodshot and glassy eyes, while speaking with him. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Shaws breath while he was speaking. Shaw advised he was dropping off a friend and going back home. TFC Hussey #6913 asked Shaw how many drinks he had tonight and he advised, not too many. Shaw advised that he was looking at his cellphone when he crashed his vehicle. Shaw was traveling northbound route 301, at Acton Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601 in lane 1 and collided into the center median curb.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  I requested Shaw to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he agreed to take. I asked Shaw if he wore glasses or contacts and he advised no. I then asked Shaw if he had any recent head injuries such as a concussion and he advised no. I then asked Shaw if he had any vision problems and he advised no. I then asked Shaw if he had any hearing problems such as deafness and he advised no. I then asked Shaw if he is a diabetic or has high blood pressure and he advised that he was boarder line diabetic.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST: (6/6 clues observed).  Shaw displayed equal pupil size, equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus in both eyes.  Shaw displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.

VERTICAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS:  Shaw did not display vertical Nystagmus in either eye.  WALK AND TURN: (4/8 clues observed). Shoes worn for test.  I properly explained and demonstrated the test to Shaw and how the test should be performed. Shaw was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Shaw was instructed, and I demonstrated, how to place his hands flat at his side and remain in that position until told to begin. Shaw was instructed to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching heel to toe. Shaw was told to keep his hands flat at his side, to keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step out loud.  On the ninth step, Shaw was instructed, and I demonstrated, how to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn 180 degrees. Shaw was again instructed, and I demonstrated, the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Shaw was instructed that once he began the test, he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, to keep his hands down at his side, and to count each step out loud.  Instructional stage:    margin-left:8px"&gt;Cannot keep balance: Shaw broke the instructional stage position once while explaining and demonstrating the test to him.   Walking Stage:    Raised arms: Shaw raised his arms on steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 on the first series of nine (9) steps. Shaw raised his arms on steps 1, 7, 8, and 9 on the second series of nine (9) steps.   Stops walking: Shaw stopped walking on step 9 on the first series of nine (9) steps.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Turn: Shaw picked up his lead foot while turning.   ONE LEG STAND: (4/4 clues observed). Left foot lifted. Shoes worn for the test.  Prior to Shaw performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Shaw was instructed to raise either foot approximately six inches off the ground, arms against his side, pointing his foot, looking down at his foot, and to count out loud one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three and to continue to count until I tell him to stop.  0 to 10 seconds:  Nothing to report.  11 to 20 seconds:    Shaw raised his arms at count 11 and continued to keep them raised for this portion of the test.  Shaw hopped at count 11 and continued to hop until count 13.   Shaw swayed at count 11 and continued to sway until count 16.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Shaw dropped his foot at count 12 and did not raise his foot back up until count 17.   21 to 30 seconds:    Shaw swayed at count 23 and continued to sway for the remainder of the test.   Shaw raised his arms at count 23 and continued to keep them raised for the remainder of the test.   Shaw dropped his foot at count 26 and did not raise his foot back up until count 29.
