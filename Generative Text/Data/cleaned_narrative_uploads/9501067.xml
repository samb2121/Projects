Mowbray #7119 of the Maryland State Police, was dispatched to 1021 Wagner Point Road, Cambridge, Dorchester County, Maryland 21613 for a report of a shooting.  Upon my arrival I made contact with the complainant; identified as Michael Arlandis Robinson (DOB: 10/06/1950) [hereinafter identified as Robinson]. Robinson advised that at around 2230 hours, while washing dishes within his kitchen, he heard a single gunshot followed by four to five additional shots striking the front of his house. Robinson stated that he looked outside but did not see anything. Robinson stated that he then called 911 to report the incident. Robinson noted that his wife; identified as Beverly Ann Robinson (DOB: 01/10/1956), was asleep in an upstairs bedroom at the time of the incident.  Robinson provided the following written statement on a Maryland State Police form 76;  I was washing dishes in the kitchen when I heard 5 or 6 pops hitting the house, my wife was asleep upstairs. I looked but I did not see anything.  When asked if he had any issues with his neighbors or knew of anyone who would want to harm him Robinson did not know of any outstanding issues or anything noteworthy. I then inquired with Robinson who else resided at the residence to which he identified his grandson; identified as Montae LeEdward Kellam (DOB: 07/23/2005) [hereinafter identified as Kellam], as an additional resident, however, was not home at the time of the shooting. Robinson estimated that Kellam left the residence between 1900 hours and 2030 hours to go in town. I asked Robinson if he knew of anyone that Kellam had been having issues with to which he advised that Kellam had been jumped by a group of individuals in the week prior at the Walmart in Easton, Maryland. Robinson stated that the incident was handled by local law enforcement. Upon further investigation it was revealed that Kellam was assaulted by known assailants while at work on October 29, 2023, in a case that was handled by the Easton Police Department. I asked Robinson to contact Kellam in an effort to have him return home which was unsuccessful after numerous attempts.   While on scene I surveyed the damage to the interior and exterior of the residence. Starting on the southwest corner of the residence, a large hole in the upper glass pane in the lower first floor window appearing to be caused by a bullet. Upon following the general trajectory, it appears a bullet entered the glass from the southwest and proceeded through a drape and into a wall within the living room, 10-15 feet away from where Robinson was standing within the kitchen. A bullet fragment was observed in the living room wall. Moving to the right of that window, damage was observed consistent with that of another bullet striking the siding. Moving towards the window to the right of the aforementioned one was another bullet hole within the with window frame. Following the trajectory of that projectile, a bullet was observed lodged into the screen siding still in place within the window. On the same window paint damage and another bullet hole were observed on the right side. To the left of the door frame, a bullet hole could be seen to the left of the sidelight which went through the wood, into the door frame, into the storm door. Another bullet hole could be observed on the left sidelight which traveled through the wood, struck the storm door and went into the right side of the door and became lodged within the wood. A separate bullet hole could be observed to the glass front door which led into the storm door where it appears it went in and cause slight bowing to the storm doors interior side. To the right of the doorway and slightly above the two first floor windows, another bullet hole could be observed to the residence.  While on scene I took forty (40) digital photographs of the scene which were uploaded to VeriPic.  Robinson was provided with the Maryland State Police case number as well as a Maryland Crime Victim and Witnesses pamphlet.  The following addresses were checked for footage with negative results; 1020 Wagner Point Road, Cambridge, Maryland 1029 Wagner Point Road, Cambridge, Maryland 5848 Ross Neck Road, Cambridge, Maryland  1007 Wagner Point Road, Cambridge, Maryland was checked for footage and contact was made with the homeowner; the Honorable Melvin Jews. Judge Jews reviewed the footage which revealed no pertinent or beneficial evidence. Judge Jews noted that while returning home from Cambridge he was behind a dark in color sedan which pulled into the driveway at 1021 Wagner Point Road around 2030 hours.   Due to the totality of the circumstances the response of the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division and a Crime Scene Technician were requested. Senior Trooper J. Hoffmeister #6163 responded to the scene and resumed the investigation.All additional scene processing was completed by a Crime Scene Technician.  I respectfully request the case be forwarded to the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division.  All events occurred in Dorchester County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Initial Report </NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Attachments/Evidence:   My Maryland State Police issued body camera footage was uploaded to the Axon website labeled 23-MSP-039254 Shooting Investigation   Narrative:  On Monday, November 6, 2023, at approximately 2236 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack were dispatched to 1021 Wagner Point Road, Cambridge, Dorchester County, Maryland 21613 for a report of a shooting.     Upon arrival, Troopers contacted the victim/homeowner, identified as Michael Arlandis Robinson (DOB: 10/06/1950 [hereinafter identified as Robinson]). Robinson advised that at around 2230 hours, while cleaning the kitchen, he heard a single gunshot followed by four to five additional shots striking the front of his residence. Robinson stated that he looked outside but did not see anything. Robinson stated that he then called 911 to report the incident. Robinson advised his wife; identified as Beverly Ann Robinson (DOB: 01/10/1956 [hereinafter identified as Beverly]), was upstairs in her bedroom at the time of the incident. Robinson and Beverly were the only occupants residing in the residence at the time of the incident. The firearm projectiles did not strike anyone nor was anyone injured.    Due to the nature of the incident, investigators from the Maryland State Police - Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region (CEDER) were contacted to respond and assume the investigation.  Upon arrival, I, S/Tpr. Jeffrey Hoffmeister #6163 with CEDER surveyed the damage to the interior and exterior of the residence. A large hole, which appeared to be caused by a firearm projectile, was observed in the upper glass portion of the lower first floor window. When I entered the residence, it appeared the trajectory of the aforementioned firearm projectile traveled through the window drape and into a wall in the living room. A firearm projectile jacket was recovered from the living room wall. A projectile was recovered from the front siding in-between the two living room windows. A projectile was observed lodged into the mesh screen portion of the second lower level first floor window. A third projectile was observed lodged within the wood on the right side of the front door frame. The front door as well as the glass panel storm door was damaged from the projectiles. To the right of the front door and slightly above the two lower first floor windows, another firearm projectile hole could be observed into the siding.    I spoke to Robinson and Beverly and obtained similar accounts of the incident that they provided to the troopers on scene. Robinson stated he was in the kitchen when the shooting occurred, he tried to look out the window to see if he could see anything or anyone ; however, did not see anything of evidentarty value. Beverly stated she was upstairs in the bedroom when she heard a boom twice at the door. Robinson came upstairs and told Beverly someone shot at the residence. Robinson and Beverly added, their grandson; identified as Montae LeEdward Kellam (DOB: 07/23/2005 [hereinafter identified as Kellam]) also resides at the residence; however, was not present during the incident. Beverly and Robinson both advised, Kellam was involved in an altercation where he was jumped by a group of individuals the week prior at the Walmart in Easton, Maryland. That investigation was handled by Easton Police Department. I attempted to cal Kellam and left a voice message for him to return my phone call. Kellam later called me back and advised he would be returning to the residence when his brother gets off work later in the morning. I advised Kellam I would talk to him when he returned to the residence or at a later date. Kellam did not return to the residence prior to me leaving the scene.    Crime Scene Technicians assigned to the Maryland State Police Crime Scene Unit responded and conducted scene processing; written consent was obtained to conduct processing. As result, three (3) firearm projectiles and one (1) firearm projectile jacket were collected and seized from the scene. Investigators conducted numerous neighborhood checks; however, no pertinent information or video footage was obtained.    Investigators will be conducted additional neighborhood/business checks for possible video surveillance and will speak with Kellam within the coming days.   Case open, investigation continuing.   </NarrativeText>
