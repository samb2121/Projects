Upon my arrival, multiple St. Marys County Sheriff Office units were already on location. During the investigation of the domestic dispute, it was determined the suspect, Neill Adam Reardon (W/M DOB 03/04/1983) assaulted his girlfriend with whom he resides with. Deputy Melton #419 informed Reardon he was under arrest for 2nd degree assault. At that time Reardon attempted to flee on foot from myself and deputies and force was used to place Reardon under arrest.   De-Escalation Techniques Used:    Prior to Reardon being placed under arrest, Deputy Melton spoke to Reardon in a calm and polite voice, informing Reardon he was being placed under arrest. Due to the nature of the incident, in order to prevent Reardon from fleeing the scene, I was unable to use de-escalation techniques prior to me using force.   Active Resistance Offered:  After informing Reardon he was under arrest, Reardon actively attempted to flee the scene on foot.   Passive Resistance Offered:  Reardon passively resisted by yelling obscenities in an aggressive manner. Reardon started yelling at the victim You got it bitch You got me locked up again.   Necessary Force to Accomplish Objective:  Use of force became necessary when Reardon escalated the situation by attempting to flee the scene on foot and resist arrest. If force was not used by Troopers and Deputies at this time, Reardon could have evaded arrest or caused additional harm to the victim.   Injuries:  After force was used, Deputy Wesner #284 observed an abrasion on Reardons left thumb. When Reardon was asked about the abrasion, Reardon advised it was probably from the cuffs or when he grabbed me and threw me up onto the trailer. Reardon did not request EMS to respond. Digital photographs were obtained of the injury.   Narrative:  On December 30, 2023 at 1920 hours, while on duty, I responded to 45285 Take It Easy Ranch Rd Lot D46, Callaway, St. Marys County, Maryland 20620 for a reported domestic dispute. Upon my arrival, multiple St. Marys County Sheriff Office units were already on location. During the course of the deputys investigation, it was determined the suspect, Neill Adam Reardon (W/M DOB 03/04/1983) assaulted his girlfriend with whom he resides with. As Deputy Melton #419 was explaining to Reardon, the victim had visible signs of injuries on her and he would be placed under arrest, Reardon attempted to flee on foot. Reardon turned towards me and attempted to run around me and extended his arms, in attempt to push me away. I extended both of my arms, placing each hand on Reardons shoulders and pushing him backwards. Reardon then stumbled backwards into the side of his residence. I then placed my right hand on Reardons left wrist and my left hand on Reardons right wrist and pushed his hands backwards to his back, so that Deputy Melton could handcuff him. At this time I am standing in front of Reardon, preventing him from attempting to walk/run forward. Deputy Melton #419 placed Reardon in handcuffs. Once Reardon was placed in handcuffs all force stopped.    Reardon was placed under arrest by Deputy Melton #419 and transported to the St. Marys County Detention and Rehabilitation Center, pending a bond review with the District Court Commissioner. While at the detention center, digital photographs of Reardon were obtained and attached to this report.   Please see Deputy Meltons #419 incident report (73207-23) for further details about the investigation into the domestic assault.   All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
