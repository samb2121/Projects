         <NarrativeText>MVR Statement:  My investigation was recorded on body-worn mobile video recording equipment.  Attachments:      Photographs of injury and scene      Emergency Petition paperwork from Carroll Hospital Center.      MSP Form 67 - Chain of Custody Log      Williams Written Witness Statement     Interviewed Person #1  Ryan Michael Grim, DOB 03/18/1992, 58, 135 lbs., W/M  Address: 3502 Old Hanover Road, Westminster, Maryland 21158  Telephone Number: 443-202-9665  Person #1 Statement:  Grim stated that his girlfriend of fourteen (14) months, Dana Williams, was going through his phone and Facebook account in the room. Due to pictures and messages she found, she accused Grim of cheating on her. Williams became upset as a result from her findings and attempted to leave the room. When Grim saw that she was attempting to leave, Grim told her to stop. Grim advised that he then went into the bathroom, and she proceeded to follow him where Grim stated that she spit on him. Grim advised that he did not make physical contact with her, and he was not that type of person. Grim later advised that he cut himself with his work utility knife because he was not aware that the blade was out.  Interviewed Person #2  Dana Karyn Williams, DOB 12/23/1995, 503, 146 lbs., W/F  Address: 503 Larson Court, Westminster, Maryland 21157  Victim Statement:  Williams stated that she went through Grims phone and discovered multiple messages and naked pictures from other women. Due to her findings, she accused Grim of cheating and a verbal argument ensued. In an attempt to de-escalate, Williams attempted to leave the room. Williams added that while she was leaving, Grim ran out of the room as well and started to cut his arm with a knife. Williams advised that while he was cutting his arm, he stated for her to call the police. Williams later stated that if she tries to leave on other occasions when she is unhappy or upset, he makes threats of hurting himself but not her.  Scene Processing  Photographs were taken of the scene as well as the injury Grim sustained to his right arm from the knife cut wounds. A written statement was also obtained from Williams.  Narrative  On January 24, 2023, at approximately 2348 hours, I, Trooper First Class Mills #6784, currently assigned to the Westminster Barrack, was dispatched to the Boston Inn, located at 533 Baltimore Boulevard, Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland for a report of an altercation between a male and a female. For this shift, I was operating marked Maryland State Police vehicle G-31. Trooper Pettyjohn #7121 was the first to arrive at the scene and immediately requested EMS for the male party for an injury to his right arm.  Upon my arrival, I observed Cpl. Mattingly #4491 talking to a female outside of room 126. The female was hysterical and talking about her boyfriend who she had found to be cheating. While listening to her conversation, I observed fresh blood on the ground directly outside the room. Due to my observations, I tracked where the blood was coming from, and it led inside the room. Within the room, I observed Trooper Pettyjohn talking with a white male who had his right arm wrapped in a white towel. I then discovered that the male had three lacerations on his right forearm that were from a utility knife. Trooper Pettyjohn also advised me that the knife used by the male was given to him by the female.  Cpl. Mattingly continued to speak with the female and identified her as Dana Karyn Williams (DOB 12/23/1995 W/F). Please refer to the above captioned paragraph, Person #2, for her statement given. Williams also completed a written witness statement which is also attached to the report.  I then spoke to the male who was identified as Ryan Michael Grim (DOB 03/14/1992 W/M). Please refer to the above captioned paragraph for his statement given Person #1.  Due to the nature of the incident and extent of Grims injuries, he was taken by ambulance to the Carroll County Hospital Center located at 200 Memorial Avenue, Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland 21157 for an emergency petition. I followed the ambulance to the hospital and completed the required documentation to have Grim evaluated by a qualified individual.  The black utility knife used by Grim to harm himself was confiscated and documented on a Maryland State Police Form 67 and stored at the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
