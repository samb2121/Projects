         <NarrativeText>    On February 23, 2023, the Maryland State Police - Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region (CEDER) received a referral from the Talbot County Department of Social Services - Child Protective Services regarding an alleged sex offense. The initial complaint reported the following:      The victim was identified as Michelle (hereinafter Michelle [O/F, DOB: 06/02/2011]), who is the daughter of James Arnaz Greene (hereinafter James [B/M, DOB: 07/03/1971]). Michelle was reported to have been residing with Susan Barklow (hereinafter Barklow [W/F, DOB: 03/12/1971]) and her grandsons to include the accused suspect, Steven Ronald Lee (hereinafter Steven [W/M, DOB: 05/22/2007]). The initial report alleged that Steven would enter Michelles bedroom and touch Michelles vagina and breasts. The report stated that Michelle had advised Susan of these allegations and the acts continued to happen. Since these events were alleged to have occurred, James and Michelle moved from Susans residence located at 9710 Tilghman Island Road, McDaniel, MD. The report was made to the Talbot County Department of Social Services who contacted the Maryland State Police - Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region (CEDER) for investigation.  Michelle Greene Forenic Interview  That same date at approximately 1200 hours, I, Corporal D. Tilghman #6254, responded to the Talbot County Child Advocacy Center where James brought Michelle to participate in a forensic interview. The interview was conducted by SW Lauren Krasko and was audibly and visually recorded. A synopsis of the interview is provided below.      When asked if Michelle knew why she was being interviewed, she advised that it was about her step-brother, alter formally identified as Steven, who basically raped me. Michelle advised that when residing with Barklow, she shared a bedroom with Stevens younger brother, Matthew. Michelle stated that Steven would enter the bedroom and touch me. She further stated that Steven would threaten her to cause her not to tell anyone, but she was unable to recall what Steven said or the exact nature of what was said. Michelle stated that when Steven would enter into the room, he would lay next to her and cuddle her. When prompted to speak more about cuddling, Michelle described that Steven would put his arms around her and try to fall asleep with her. Michelle stated while laying down, her back would be facing the front of Stevens body as he cuddled her.      When prompted to further describe Steven touching her, she stated that she could not remember it fully. Sometimes Michelle reported falling asleep and was unable to remember the full event, while other times she was awake due to Steven disturbing her sleep. On one occasion, Steven was reported to make Michelle cry when he told her not to tell anyone. Michelle stated that she did not tell anyone until recently because, at the time of the alleged events, she was only ten-years-old and did not know any better.      Throughout the course of the interview, Michelle made reference to Steven raping her. When asked to describe what she meant by rape, Michelle stated, I dont really know how to explain it. When prompted to describe what Steven did after cuddling, Michelle advised that he would get up and leave. When asked what areas of Michelles body Steven touched, she stated he used his hands to touch her upper chest and stomach. Michelle stated that her clothes were on; however, Steven would use his hands to touch her under her shirt.      Michelle stated that Steven would give her hickies on her neck and shoulders. Steven would then proceed to get ice, so it would reduce the bruising caused by the hickies. Steven would then proceed to comfort her.      Michelle referenced Steven pulling her pants down and the FI asked Michelle to speak about that. Michelle stated that Steven would pull her pants down while laying down, and he would hear someone downstairs and leave. Michelle advised that other times he would touch her. Michelle described cuddling again and stated that Steven touched her chest and stomach. When asked if Steven has ever hurt any part of her body, Michelle stated, not really, hes only like bit me by accident.      When asked if there was ever a time that it occurred when Matthew was not in the room, she was unsure. When asked about the time that Steven bit her, she advised that Steven got under the blanked and hugged her. While kissing her neck, he reportedly bit it and then provided her comfort due to the pain.      Michelle denied Steven ever touching any other part of her body. Michelle denied Steven ever asking / forcing Michelle to do anything with his body.      Michelle clarified that Steven would pull her shorts down and touch her waist. Michelle was provided a anatomical diagram of a female and was prompted to circle the areas that Steven touched. Michelle circled the neck, arms, chest, lower waist, and upper thigh. Michelle was unable to describe Steven touching any part of her intimate areas (breasts, buttocks, vagina, etc.). Michelle began to describe that Steven would use two fingers on her waist. When asked to describe that Steven would do, Michelle stated that Steven would use his fingers to push on her waist, and sometimes he would hold her waist and touch her chest with his other hand. Michelle identified on the diagram where Steven would use his two fingers as the side of her waist. She stated that Steven would touch her back area, but not in an inappropriate way.  End of Synopsis.      While at the Child Advocacy Center, an interview was conducted with James. James advised that he and Michelle resided with Barklow from 2018 to 2019, moving form the residence sometime in 2019. James advised that he had no prior knowledge of these allegations and did not suspect anything to be occurring due to Michelle seeming comfortable around everyone. James confirmed that Michelle shared a bedroom with Michael and bedtime was between 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm. James was unable to provide any additional information trelevanto this investigation.  Interview with Steven      On April 18, 2023 at 1215 hours, Steven was interviewed at Saint Michaels High School. Steven denied ever entering Michelles bedroom or laying in bed with her. Steven did not know why Michelle would make these allegations. Steven stated that he was confused by this situation and did not have any information to provide relevant to this investigation.   Based on the above information, the following can be concluded:   Michelles age at the time of the alleged events: 6 - 8  Stevens age at the time of the alleged events: 10 - 12  Michelle described cuddling and touching of her waist, thighs, upper chest, and stomach  Penetration of sexual areas was never disclosed  Rape was never explained or clarified  Michael shared a bedroom with Michelle; Steven denied the allegations.
