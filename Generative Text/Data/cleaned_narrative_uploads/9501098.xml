         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera Defendant: Zane Scott Kline  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,100 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On December 9, 2023 at approximately 0121 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on the O/L I-695 in the area of Belair Road, Maryland. I observed a black Chevrolet Silverado bearing Pennsylvania registration ZWK0470 pass my patrol vehicle. The Chevrolet was unable to drive within a single lane and was swerving left and right. Swerved left onto the fog line and right. Left over fog line, jerked right. Right over in middle lane, jerked left, straddling dotted white line. Approached the rear of another vehicle, delayed in moving left, passed the vehicle while the passenger tires were still in the same lane as the other vehicle. Swerved right over middle lane and the dotted white line. Straddling dotted white line separating two lanes. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar (S/N: EG-02387), which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 75 MPH in a posted 55 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Chevrolet. The Chevrolet was delayed in stopping prior to before Harford Road.  The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. Training certificates and calibration records will be made available upon request. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Chevrolet on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the only occupant in the vehicle. I explained the reason for the stop and requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Pennsylvania drivers license as Zane Scott Kline. He was unable to find his registration card. While speaking with Kline, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I deliberately observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. When asked where he was headed to, he stated PA. I returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Chevrolet and requested Kline to exit his vehicle and walk to the front. His speech was slurred when he stated that I did not ask him for his license or his registration. He complied and exited his vehicle. He was staggering while walking. While speaking with Kline outside of the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. He walked towards me and put his chest next to me while yelling. I repeatedly had to ask him to remove his hands from his pocket. When asked about alcohol consumption prior to driving, he continued to repeat my questions. He stated that he had 2 beers (Budweiser) at the union hall. I informed Kline that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests.  I asked Kline the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  No Head Injuries - No Medication  No Problems with knees or ankles  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus   Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Kline stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage:    Lost balance offline to the right 3 times.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Took 8 steps when instructed to take 9.  Turn: Spun right in one motion Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Stopped to regain his balance prior to the second nine steps  Stepped completely offline on steps 2 and 4.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Kline stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Seconds 11-20:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Seconds 21-30:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Right foot hit the ground   Again stated that he only had 2 beers. He stated that he waited an hour. I explained the preliminary breath test to him and he stated that he would take it. I put the straw on the PBT and explained it to him. He then stated that he did not want to take it and did not have to take it. PBT refused  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Kline was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0134 hours, I told Kline to turn around, put his hands behind his back and that he was under arrested. He stated no and that he did not have to. I grabbed Klines right wrist and he pulled away from me. I continued to tell him that he was under arrest and that if he did not turn around, he would be charged criminally. Kline eventually turned around and place his hands behind his back. I placed the handcuffs on both of Klines wrists. Kline then he began pulling away from me prior to me being able to double lock the handcuffs. Kline called me a bitch and continued to pull away from me towards the travel lane. Due to the location right next to the travel lane of I-695, I continued to hold Klines right hand and wrist to remain control of him for his safety. Kline stopped pulling away and I was able to secure the handcuffs on his wrist and double lock them. Kline again attempted to pull away and I continued to hold his wrist and hand to maintain control of him. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy. Kline complained that the handcuffs hurt him and he wanted them loosened. I had him exit the vehicle and loosened the handcuffs for him. He was transported to the Baltimore County Towson Precinct for processing.  Upon arrival at the precinct, I provided Kline with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Kline listened to the DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. At 0208hours, Kline agreed to take a breath test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Kline beginning at 0158 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Kline was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Officer Washburn of the Baltimore County Police on a certified instrument. Kline had a result of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0225 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****.14 grams of alcohol****  Kline had scratches on his right ring finger and his wrists from pulling away when placed in handcuffs. I asked Kline if he wanted me to call a medic for him and he refused. He stated that his mom  Kline was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released. All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
