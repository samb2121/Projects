         <NarrativeText>INCIDENT Theft of Motor Vehicle Parts - Catalytic Converter Major Charge CR 7-104 Theft 1500 to 25K  DATE/TIME 09/25/2023 at approximately 0750 hours  LOCATION Note - Theft was at residential address of victims mother, DELL 2708 Old Taneytown Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21158  RECORDING All events were recorded on my body-worn AXON camera and the AXON camera issued to MSP G-22.  ATTACHMENTS a. photo of location of Honda Element in relation to victims residence b. photo of Honda Element sitting parked c. photo of the missing Honda part and subsequent damage done to the Honda  VICTIM REYNOLDS, Jennifer Alais 2/F DOB 06/17/1973 MD OLN R543398040452 2539 Murkle Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21157 (410) 259 - 8756 jeryn@gmail.com  SUSPECT Unknown  OTHER: VICTIMS MOTHER Note - Property owner where theft occurred DELL, Sarah Jane 2/F DOB 09/02/1953 MD OLN D400758368684 (410) 848 - 0854  PROPERTY DAMAGED/VEHICLE 2008 Honda Element, Red VIN 5J6YH28718L012672 Maryland Registration Plates 1AV9627  SCENE PROCESSING/PHYSICAL EVIDENCE I interviewed the victim. I interviewed the victims mother. I searched the scene for evidence. I obtained photos of the crime scene, which was uploaded to Veripic. I canvassed the neighborhood for additional witnesses and security cameras, and was unable to obtain any additional footage.  ACTIONS TAKEN On 09/25/2023 I was on-duty, in uniform, and operating marked MSP vehicle G-22. I was assigned by the Westminster dispatcher for a call of service relating to a stolen catalytic converter at 2708 Old Taneytown Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21158.  Upon arriving at the scene, I met with the caller. I identified her as REYNOLDS, Jennifer Alais (DOB 06/17/1973) by Maryland drivers license. RENOLDS stated that on Friday 09/22/2023 evening, she visited her mother at 2539 Murkle Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21158. REYNOLDS had parked her red Honda Element with Maryland registration plates 1AV9627 directly across the street from her mothers residence on her parking pad. REYNOLDS noted they spent the entire weekend in her residence as it was rainy.  The one event REYNOLDS recalled that was unscheduled is as follows: REYNOLDS stated that during the weekend daytime, she forgets if it was Saturday or Sunday, a white van pulled up to park along the road shoulder 20 feet east on Old Taneytown in relation to her Honda. The white vans visible occupants were two adult middle-aged males, no further descriptions recalled at all. Both subjects got out and looked at the front of the abandoned home across the street from her at 2715 Old Taneytown Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21157. While rare, it is not unusual for people to look at the abandoned home as it is foreclosed and for sale by the bank. After several minutes they left. Seeing as it was rare but not unusual, REYNOLDS did not think to note any distinguishing features of the male subjects, nor does she recall any identifying marks or stickers on the van. Additionally, REYNOLDS does not recall the state of registration nor any of the information on the registration plate.  On the morning of 09/25/2023, REYNOLDS started the car to leave to go to work and immediately noticed an unusually loud engine sound. REYNOLDS turned the car off, and looked underneath it. REYNOLDS noticed that the catalytic converter had been cut out of the exhaust system on the Hondas underside. REYNOLDS called 911 as soon as she realized what had happened.  Of note, REYNOLDS states that the residents of 2124 Old Taneytown Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21157 have been under surveillance by MSP in the past for CDS activities, up to and including agency cameras posted on telephone poles but none are there now. REYNOLDS states that she still sees numerous unknown cars come-and-go after a brief stop at the residence. REYNOLDS and her mother also report routinely mowing the lawn touching adjacent their property as otherwise it will quickly become overgrown.  I then identified RENOLDS mother and the property owner of the residence, by Maryland drivers license as DELL, Sarah Jane (DOB 09/02/1953). DELL concurred with REYNOLDS in stating they had neither seen nor heard anything alarming over the weekend. DELL confirmed both had been in the residence the entire time which is approaxmately 25-30 feet away from the parked Honda. DELL pointed out her bedroom window, the first second-story shuttered window on the lefthand side when one faces the residence. DELLs room has a clear line-of-sight across Old Tawneytown road from their second story down onto the parking pad.  I observed the weather at the time continued to be consistent with the weekends rainy weather: a light fog or mist with intermittent light rain. The ground was wet and there were no footprints nor unknown tiremarks marks in the immediate area.  I then observed the parking pavement area immediately under the Honda was dry. The dry spot was noted to start from directly under where the catalytic converter had been cut. This dry area extended down the length of the muffler, stopping prior to the tailpipe portion of the exhaust system. The muffler of the vehicle had a heated bronzed appearance. It was odd that this was the only substantially dry pavement in the area as no other visible surfaces in the immediate area was dry. The Hondas roof, sides, and tires were wet and consistent with the observed weather conditions. After a search, neither metal debris from the cut nor any foreign objects were noted in the immediate area around the Honda or on the parking pad. I estimate the value of the catalytic converter and the replacement of the exhaust systems assembly to be based on a search of Honda OEM parts.  I then obtained pictures (see attachments) of the crime scene.  I then investigated both 2715 Old Taneytown Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21157 and 2124 Old Taneytown Road, Westminster, MD, Carroll County, 21157. Both front lawns are overgrown with bushes and tall plants, appear to be ill maintained, and have no signs of routine habitation from the outside.  Reynolds was provided the case number and victims rights pamphlet. I request this case be suspended due to exhausting all viable potential leads.     SUSPENDED</NarrativeText>
