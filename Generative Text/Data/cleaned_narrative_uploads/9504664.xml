         <NarrativeText>The incident was captured via I-24 in car camera and body warn camera.    DUI Case # 23-MSP-034391 Maryland State Police Easton Barrack  Training/Certificates: I am trained by the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs).  Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE)  Trained and Certified as a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE)   Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1) Not observed   Personal Contact (Phase 2)   On 9/28/2023, at approximately 1952 hours, I, TFC Cambra #7191 of the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, was dispatched to the area of the East Bound lanes of Ocean Gateway and Beaver Dam Rd for a reported motor vehicle collision with a reported vehicle roll over with entrapment, and the vehicle to be on fire. It was reported that a large crowd was forming around the vehicle. Upon arrival, I observed a plethora of fire apparatus and emergency personnel on scene. I observed a white Ford Expedition bearing Maryland registration 32571M9 to be partially in lane 1 with the front of the vehicle facing East Bound traffic. I observed the vehicle to be on fire and have substantial damage around the vehicle.  I made contact with a witness on scene, identified as Retired Federal Air Marshall John Farabee. Farabee stated he pulled the driver, later identified as Suzanne Elizabeth Toomey, from out of the vehicle and that she tried to get back into the vehicle while it was on fire. Farabee stated Toomey stated she had two dogs in the vehicle. He also stated he didnt observe any physical injuries on her and that she was in shock in the rear of the ambulance. Farabee stated he didnt see any of the dogs. I asked him if he saw the crash. He stated he saw the car spin and then saw the fire right away. He stated he did not observe the impact, he saw the spin post impact. Farabee reported a couple civilians got her out of the car and she tried to go back into the car. He then removed her again from the vehicle and walked her down the road.   I made contact with Toomey in the rear of the ambulance on scene. I identified myself to her and then asked her what happened. She stated a guy slammed on his breaks and I slammed on mine. She then stated she didnt know which way to go and stopped. I asked her where she was coming from which she stated from her house in Sykesville Maryland. She stated that she was headed to her house in Ocean City. I asked her if she stopped anywhere on her way from Sykesville to Ocean City. She stated yes, but she could not recall where she stopped. I asked what she stopped for and then stated fuel/food. She replied food. I asked her if she knew what town she stopped in. She replied Kent Island maybe. I asked her to spell her name. While she was speaking, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. While she was speaking, I also observed her to have slurred speech. I asked her what she had to drink that evening. She stated she had two drinks. She stated that they were in a can and they were white crushes or orange crushes. I asked her if she had those drinks when she stopped on Kent Island which she nodded.    I asked her if she takes medications every day. She stated she takes Wellbutrin that is taken in the morning. She also stated that she takes gabapentin for four previous surgeries to her knee. She stated that she took both the Wellbutrin and half of the Gabapentin that morning. She stated she did not take anything else that day. Both medications were located on scene which matched which she stated she took. Both medications had her name on both bottles. Toomey was visibly upset from the collision and she was complaining of pain to her jaw. She asked on several occasions to get her bags from the vehicle. She appeared to be unaware of the damage to her vehicle. She reported that there was to black labs in the vehicle while she was traveling. We checked the area and peered into the vehicle as it was being extinguished and found no signs of dogs. While walking around the scene, I observed cans of the Orange crush to be scattered amongst the debris in the roadway.   I made contact with another witness, identified as Valentine Gonzalez Zepeda (Officer Gonzalez of the Talbot County Animal Control). He stated he was just coming out of his residence and that the crash happened so fast. He stated when he saw it she was flipping. He stated he didnt know if it was because she flipped the steering where or because she was coming the wrong way. Officer Gonzalez stated there were two cars coming and he didnt know if she was trying to avoid them. He stated she then hit the guardrail and it appeared as if she hit the gas even harder and the vehicle went higher. He stated he made contact with her in the vehicle. Officer Gonzalez stated she stated that she was ok but her face hurt. He stated she was looking for her dogs in the vehicle. After they removed her from the vehicle, he offered to help look for the dogs. Officer Gonzalez stated they checked the car for the dogs and they didnt see anything in the vehicle or in the area. Officer Gonzalez stated she wasnt listening and she tried to get back into the vehicle when Retired Federal Air Marshall John Farabee grabbed her to prevent her going back into the car as it was smoking.   I was advised by additional Troopers on scene that Toomey was refusing any medical treatment on scene by medics. I again checked in the vehicle to attempt to locate any of the dogs which was negative. Toomey again refused medical treatment when I asked her. She was concerned about her dogs and that she was ok but her jaw hurt. I advised her that I would like to place her through a couple of tests to see if she was okay to drive which she stated that she did not want to drive. I advised her that it was to ensure that she was okay to drive before the collision. She replied kind of but I have to tell you I have had four knee surgeries. I asked her when her last surgery was which she stated 2021. She stated that she does not have good balance and that she takes gabapentin.   Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3)   The evaluation was conducted on scene on the right shoulder. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions were night time conditions with light emitting from the various emergency vehicles on scene. Weather conditions were mostly clear with the ground wet. Toomey appeared to be in good physical conditions and did not display any visible injuries. While standing on the shoulder with Toomey, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person.    Glasses/Contacts  Contacts worn during the test  Medical Conditions  none Injuries  no other injuries other than jaw injury from crash and her left knee from four prior surgeries.   Medications  Gabapentin, Wellbutrin taken daily   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 Clues observed)  The first test that was administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus for the test. The test was explained to Toomey. After explaining the directions to Toomey, I observed Toomey to have equal pupil size, no resting nystagmus, and her eyes tracked equally.     text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit  present in both eyes   2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  3) Onset Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes   Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not observed   I had to instruct Toomey to not move her head multiple times. While completing the test, she stopped and stated that she wanted her dogs and that she was freaking out. While Toomey was standing as directed, I observed her to sway back and forth slightly for the duration of the test. I also observed her to have glassy blood shot eyes.   Walk and Turn (0/8 Clues Observed)  test not completed  The location of the test was relocated to the left shoulder/lane #1 to allow for the flow of traffic and the safety of Toomey, other emergency personnel on scene, and myself. Once relocated, she stated that she did not have good balance and that I would explain and demonstrate the test to her. I asked her if she felt that she could not complete the test She was told to remain in the starting position and to not start the test until I directed her to begin. She stated with the knee surgery and the medicine she wasnt sure. I advised her that I could explain and demonstrate the test to see if she could. She stated I understand what your asking be but with the knee surgery and the medicine. She began to walk to complete the test when I directed to stop and not start. I asked her if she wanted to try the test and she said she could try but she would not succeed at. I asked her if she wanted to do the test and that I needed a yes or no answer. She stated No because Im going to freaking fail it.   Test Not Completed  One Leg Stand (2/4 Clues Observed)   The test was explained and demonstrated to Toomey. After explaining the test, I asked her if she understood the directions which she stated she did. Toomey elected to raise her right foot.  Instructional Phase:  Toomey broke the instructional stance and stood in place and began to look around for her dogs. I asked her if she needed me to reexplain the test which she stated she didnt.   Balance and Count Phase:   Seconds 1-10  Raises arms  Puts foot down  Seconds 11-20  Test concluded at approximately 13 seconds   Seconds 21-30  N/a  Toomey became agitated while completing the test. I asked her if she wanted to continue the test and she said she didnt.   The preliminary breath test was offered. Toomey was explained that the test was voluntary and that it could not be used against her. Toomey inhaled for the test causing the PBT straw to generate a whistling sound. I advised her that the test was not completed correctly. She became upset and declined the test again. PBT result inconclusive.    Arrest  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Toomey was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:     text-align:justify"&gt;Glassy eyes   text-align:justify"&gt;Blood shot eyes   text-align:justify"&gt;Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person   text-align:justify"&gt;Admission to consuming an alcoholic beverage prior to driving   text-align:justify"&gt;Locating the canned alcoholic beverages that were consumed scattered amongst the scene   text-align:justify"&gt;Single vehicle collision    text-align:justify"&gt;Slurred speech    text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Clues observed during standardized field sobriety tests    Due to the number of observations, I placed Toomey under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 2048 hours. While placing Toomey under arrest, she became agitated and began to move around slightly while placing hand cuffs on. I asked Toomey if she had anything on he that would poke or stick me. She replied fuck no in an agitated manor. A preliminary search of Toomey was conducted on scene. A 20-minute mouth observation began at the time of the search. Toomey was placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle as per department policy and regulation. TFC Mills #6177 advised that he observed one of the dogs to be South of the collision however when he attempted to retrieve the dog, it ran away. Trooper Buglio #7433 remained on scene for the vehicle to be removed.   I transported Toomey to the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack for processing. While enroute to the Barrack, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. After arriving at the Barrack, a female Deputy was requested to complete a search of Toomey. Toomey was provided a copy of the Maryland DR-15 advice of rights. The official DR-15 audio from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration was played. The room was well lit by ceiling lights. After the complete DR-15 audio was played, I asked Toomey if she wanted to take the test. She stated no I want to go find my dogs. I asked her again and she stated no. The intoximeter test was refused at 2122 hours.   Intoximeter: Test refused  Trooper Buglio responded to the barrack after a citizen located one of the dogs unharmed. The other dog was not located.   All necessary paperwork was completed. Toomey was provided copies of all necessary paperwork and issued the appropriate citations. An ACRS report was completed for the collision. While completing all paperwork.  Toomey was released to her brother John Hoddinott at the barrack at 2338 hours.   After Toomey was released, I returned to the scene of the collision and checked the area for the missing dog. The dog was not located.   All events occurred in Talbot County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.    </NarrativeText>
