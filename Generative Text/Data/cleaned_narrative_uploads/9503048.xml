         <NarrativeText>Attachments: None  Narrative: C-19 has a in-car camera that was functional and recording at the time of the traffic stop. I have a body worn camera that was functional and recording at the time of the traffic stop.  On Saturday, April 15, 2023, at approximately 0406 hours, I was on routine patrol and parked my patrol vehicle in the parking lot of Sheetz located at11601 Winchester Road South West Cumberland, MD. I looked over to my left and observed a male occupant in the passenger seat of a silver Dodge Caliber. The driver appeared to be nodding out based on my training, knowledge and experience. I made contact with the MSP - Cumberland Barrack and requested an additional unit prior to making contact. TFC Williams arrived on scene and we made contact with the driver. The driver was still swaying, stopping and pausing his movements inside the vehicle at the time of first contact. I knocked on the glass of the driver side window and the male occupant awoke but was extremely confused and took time to regain his motor functions in order to open the door.  I detected the strong odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the vehicle and asked the subject to exit, and he complied. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as John Wesley Jones, W/M, DOB 02/24/1995. Jones advised that this same thing happened to him three times in the past. Jones advised that he was a medicinal medical marijuana user and advised there was marijuana inside of the vehicle. Based on this information and the smell of marijuana I performed a probable cause search.  Upon conducting a probable cause search of the vehicle, I located marijuana prescribed to Jones and multiple smoking devices. I also located multiple prescriptions, prescribed to Jones that were depressants. Jones also advised that he is prescribed Suboxone. I did not observe any other indicators that Jones was under the influence of heroin/fentanyl usage.  The probable cause search yielded negative results based on his lawful possession of marijuana and prescription medications. Jones was not operating his motor vehicle at the time of the encounter. Jones was advised of the importance not to operate any motor vehicle upon taking his medications (per the labels on the bottle) and to be in a secure place when taking them.    I respectfully request this case be closed. All events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
