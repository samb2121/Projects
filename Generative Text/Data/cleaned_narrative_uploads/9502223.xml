         <NarrativeText>MSP Unmarked Vehicle, D-08: In-Car/Body Camera Operational  Case # : 23-MSP-040496  Arrestee Information:      Defendant: Haba, Christina Louise      Date of Birth: 10/02/1967      Date of Arrest: November 15, 2023      Time of Arrest: 2131 hours     CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING      Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      Certified in A.R.I.D.E(Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement) to enhance skills to observe, identify, and articulate the signs of impairment related to drugs, alcohol, or a combination of both      A distinguished graduate of Marylands DUI Institute, a rigorous 40-hour program that provides specialized training on enforcing laws related to driving under the influence.      Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police      I have apprehended more than 75 impaired drivers as a Maryland State Trooper to date.      Certified as an expert in Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus by the Harford County Courts     VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On November 15, 2023, at approximately 2045 hours, I responded to a two-vehicle motor vehicle collision at Churchville Road and Campus Hills Drive, in front of the Wawa at 2300 Churchville Road.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I arrived on the scene at approximately 2107 hours, and contacted the reporting party, Guy Arthur Brubaker(2/M 03-06-1954) who was involved in the motor vehicle collision, stated that he was sitting at the intersection, awaiting a green signal when his motor vehicle was struck in the rear. I instructed Brubaker to supply me with his drivers license, registration, and insurance for his vehicle and while he searched for that I made contact with Christina Louise Haba(2/F 10-02-1967), later identified via her Maryland drivers license.  I immediately asked if Haba was okay, and she replied she was fine. I asked what happened as I came closer to Haba. She explained, I accidentally ran into them, and Im very sorry for it. As Haba spoke, I could hear that her speech was slurred and I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath. I quickly checked the damages on her vehicle and then asked Haba where she was coming from, she replied, A party, yesIve had a bit to drink. I inquired more regarding Habas drinking, she stated she was drinking beers at this party, and when asked how many, she replied Four, as in shed consumed four beers.  I asked that Haba provide me with her drivers license, vehicle registration, and insurance information. I returned to Brubaker collected his information, and returned to Haba to collect hers. Haba was able to locate her drivers license but struggled to find the registration card for her vehicle, ultimately never providing that information.  I completed an information exchange form for Brubaker and had him leave the scene. I returned to Haba and asked again questions about her alcoholic consumption, she was able to recite that she had consumed four Miler lite beers(16 ounces). Haba stated that shed last consumed an alcoholic beverage approximately two hours before the incident. I observed that Habas eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I asked how long Haba was at the party, and she stated approximately three hours.  I explained my concerns to Haba, regarding her alcoholic consumption and the fact that shed been in a motor vehicle accident, I wanted to dispel that her impairment was a factor in the collision, so I asked Haba to submit to standardized field sobriety testing to ensure she wasnt too impaired while operating the motor vehicle. Haba agreed to submit to field sobriety testing.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was completed out of the roadway, in a parking lot. The surface was dry, level, and free from any visible debris. The weather was clear and approximately 55 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of natural moonlight.   I asked Haba the following questions before proceeding with Standard Field Sobriety Testing:  Physical Ailments/Medical Conditions/Medications  Heart Condition(Affects Habas ability to maintain her balance)  Contacts/Glasses - No.  Resting Nystagmus - No.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED WHICH INDICATE IMPAIRMENT)  The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and demonstrated to Haba before she began the test. I asked Haba if she understood the tests and she agreed. The following clues and observations were made during this test.      Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes      The onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes     *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Present in both eyes  NOTE - While testing, Haba took a moment, and stated I probably shouldnt be driving, I understand thatcan I please not be arrested?  NOTE - Haba swayed back and forth, side to side a lot during testing.  HABA AFTER COMPLAINING OF MEDICAL REASONS, DECIDED NOT TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THE STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTING.  ARREST:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Haba was driving under the influence of alcohol:      My observed signs of impairment as Haba performed field sobriety tests      Motor vehicle collision caused by Haba      Habas bloodshot and glassy eyes      The strong odor of alcoholic beverages coming from Habas person     Haba was placed under arrest at 2131 hours for driving under the influence.  A search of Habas person was conducted in front of my patrol vehicle. Haba was then placed inside and transported to the Bel Air barrack for further processing.  Haba was read a DR15 and refused to conduct a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:  Nothing to report.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: REFUSED  Haba was cited for DUI and other traffic violations and released from the Bel Air Barrack.  I request the case be closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
