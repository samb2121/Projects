         <NarrativeText>MSP H-21 andin-car camera was not functional. The body camera wasoperational. Defendant: Bryant Terrell Rawlings Date of Birth: 05/27/1983 Date of Arrest: 05/28/2023 Times of Arrest: 0222 hours MD Soundex #: MD-10273875291 DUI #: 23-104 (La Plata)  Second Offense.  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:  I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I have completed the Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training. I have completed training to administer a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT). I am also a trained and certified RADAR and LIDAR operator. I am a trained and certified Advance Collision Investigator (ACI).  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Sunday, May 28, 2023, at approximately 0144 hours, I (TPR Lagchu #6846) responded to a single vehicle collision on northbound Maryland Route 5 at Mattawoman Beantown Road, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland. Upon my arrival, I observed a black Infiniti M37X bearing Maryland registration 8CG0310 disabled in a ditch, with the rear drivers side tire damaged and front end damaged. No airbags were deployed.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  While on the scene, I observed a male who was later identified by his Maryland drivers license as Bryant Terrell Rawlings, black male, DOB: 05/27/1983 of Waldorf, Maryland standing beside the Infiniti. I contacted Rawlings and asked him what happened. Rawlings stated he was coming from his mothers house in Calvert County and fell asleep. When he woke up he was in the ditch. Rawlings acknowledged he was the operator of the Infiniti and the only occupant at the time of the collision. While talking to Rawlings, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Rawlings breath and person. He had glassy and bloodshot eyes. Rawlings advised the previous day was his birthday and he was tired and exhausted. I asked Rawlings what he had consumed containing alcohol prior to driving his vehicle. Rawlings advised he had consumed Crown Peach Whisky. A check through the MVA revealed Rawlings had a valid class BM license. I asked Rawlings to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) and he agreed to do the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3): The evaluation was performed in a Shell gas station parking lot. The surface was dry, level, and free from any visible debris. The weather was clear. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, my flashlight and gas station lights. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Rawlings appeared to be in a good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.   I asked Rawlings the following questions:  Glasses or Contacts  None. Medical Conditions  None. Injuries  None. Medication  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed): The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Rawlings eyes. Rawlings was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Rawlings pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Rawlings was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Rawlings movedhis head and was reminded not to move his head.  1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Vertical gaze nystagmus was present.  WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed):  Before Rawlings performed the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Rawlings was advised to take nine (9) steps in an imaginary straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. Rawlings was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, he was explained and demonstrated to maintain his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Rawlings was again explained that the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Rawlings was instructed that once he began the test, he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Rawlings if he understood the test, and he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage: 1) Lost balance - Feet broke apart and Rawlings did not regain the starting position. He stood with feet staggered.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1) Rawlings staggered and stepped offline on steps 1 and 2. 2) Rawlings raised his hands greater than six inches away from his body throughout the test for balance.                                                             Turn: Rawlings did not turn as demonstrated. In an attempt to turn, he staggered, lost control of his balance and stepped backward.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1) Rawlings staggered and stepped offline on steps 3, 6 and 8. 2) Rawlings raised his hands greater than six inches from his body for balance throughout the test. 3) Rawlings stopped during the turn after he lost his balance to regain balance before continuing the test.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed): Prior to Rawlings performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Rawlings was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When told to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Rawlings was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage: Rawlings raised his right foot.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: 1) Rawlings swayed his body to the left and right through the test. 2) Rawlings raised his arms more than 12 inches from his body for balance.  Seconds 11-20: 1) Rawlings swayed his body left and right before putting his foot on the ground. 2) He raised his arms more than 12 inches from his body for balance. 3) His foot hit the ground one time. Rawlings stopped and regain balance before continuing the test.  Seconds 21-30: 1) Rawlings swayed his body slightly to the left and right. 2) He raised his arms more than 12 inches from his body for balance.  While on the scene, Rawlings was offered a preliminary breath test which he agreed to take. PBT results was 0.12.  ARREST Due to the above of observations, I concluded Rawlings was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely prior to the collision. At approximately 0222 hours, I placed Rawlings under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol.A preliminary search of Rawlings was conducted on the scene, and it revealed that he had nothing dangerous on his person. Rawlings was placed in the front passenger seat in H-21 per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack for processing. Upon arrival at the Barrack, I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Rawlings in English. At 0257 hours, Rawlings agreed to take the breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period when Rawlings was placed under arrest. A preliminary search of Rawlings was performed on the scene, and it revealedhe had nothing in his mouth. I observed Rawlings from the time of arrest until the time he agreed to take the breath. The breath test was conducted by Sgt. Maszarose #6174.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: **** .14 per grams of alcohol 210 liters of breath ****   Rawlings was cooperative during custody. Rawlings was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released at the La Plata Barrack to a sober driver.  All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland. Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
