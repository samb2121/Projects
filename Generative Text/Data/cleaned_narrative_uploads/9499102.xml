         <NarrativeText>DUI#: 23-124  Driver:Niesha Janeen Etkins  MVR Statement:This incident was recorded on BWC, Q-32 is not equipped with MVR.  Narrative:  Phase 1: Vehicle in Motion   Vehicle in motion was not observed by myself, as the vehicle had already been stopped upon my arrival.  Phase 2: Personal Contact   On 06/03/2023 at approximately 0046 hours I, Trooper Houck #7577, arrived on scene to assist Corporal Engleman #5835 after he had stopped a vehicle Westbound US-50 at 197. Corporal Engleman advised that a witness had called the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack to report a black Infiniti QX60 bearing Maryland registration 9ED3603, driving erratically at high speeds, and having previously collided with a guardrail in the area of Westbound US-50 at Davidsonville Rd. Corporal Engleman located this vehicle, and advised that the vehicle was driving erratically at speeds of 90 miles per hour, before he was able to stop the vehicle Westbound US-50 at 197. Upon making contact with the driver of the vehicle, I was able to identify her as Niesha Janeen Etkins (1/F DOB: 08/19/1991) by her Maryland Drivers License. While conversing with Etkins, as she sat in the drivers seat of her vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath, Etkins also displayed glassy eyes, and slurred speech. I then asked Etkins how much she had to drink, to which she replied no drinks. At this time, with Corporal Engleman already on scene to assist, I ordered Etkins to step out of the vehicle, and advised her that I would be running her through Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  Phase 3: Pre Arrest Screenings  Roadside/Lighting Conditions   Standardized Field Sobriety Tests were performed on the right shoulder of the road, in front of my patrol vehicle. Road conditions were level, lighting conditions were dark, but performed in front of my patrol vehicle with emergency lights and headlights activated.  Medical Screening  Prior to beginning Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, I asked Etkins a series of questions to determine if she was fit to perform a series of tests that involved walking and standing on one foot. Etkins advised that she was not taking any medications, but did claim to have a sprained ankle. Etkins did not advise of any other injuries or ailments, and agreed to attempt Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus 6 of 6 Clues Observed  Once the medical screening was completed, I utilized the tip of my ink pen as the stimulus and held it approximately 12-15 inches away from Etkins face and slightly above eye level. I instructed Etkins to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes and eyes only, while keeping her head completely still. Etkins stated she understood these instructions and did not have any questions.  1.) Lack of smooth pursuit  Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation  Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of nystagmus  Present in both eyes.  Walk and Turn: 5 of 8 Clues Observed  To begin, I instructed and demonstrated Etkins to stand with her right foot directly in front of her left foot, touching heel to toe with her arms straight down by her side. I instructed Etkins to remain in the position and not to move from it until instructed to do so. I then instructed and demonstrated the test by taking 3 heel to toe steps on a straight line while counting my steps out loud. Once I reached my third step, I kept my lead foot planted and began taking a series of small choppy steps around my lead foot, before taking 3 more heel to toe steps back in the opposite direction. I instructed that I took 3 steps for demonstration purposes, but I would be asking her to take a total of 9 heel to toe steps in each direction. Etkins stated she understood my instructions and did not have any questions.  1.) Cannot keep balance- Etkins lost her balance and stumbled out of the starting position once, prior to beginning the test.   2.) Steps off line- Etkins failed to walk in a straight line throughout the entirety of the test, veering left and right with each step on both sets of 9 steps. 3.) Fails to go heel to toe- Etkins failed to make heel to toe steps on each of her first and second sets of 9 steps, leaving a gap of several inches between her heel and toe.     4.) Improper Turn- Upon performing her first set of 9 steps, Etkins took a series of short, choppy steps around her lead foot in order to turn, as demonstrated. However, instead of turning 180 degrees in the opposite direction, Etkins performed a quarter turn and began walking towards the roadway, before I redirected her, and had her walk towards my patrol vehicle.     5.) Incorrect number of sets: When performing her second set of 9 steps, Etkins took 14 steps, before I advised her to stop walking.  One Leg Stand:  To begin, I instructed Etkins to stand with her heels and toes together, with her arms straight down by her side. I then instructed and demonstrated the test by picking a foot and lifting it approximately 6 inches off the ground, while keeping my foot parallel to the ground, and looking down at my toes while counting by one-thousands out loud. Etkins stated she understood my instructions and did not have any questions.  1.) Sways- Etkins swayed from right to left, throughout the entire time she was balancing.     2.) Raises arms- Etkins raised her arms more than 6 inches away from her body, several times throughout the test, as she struggled to maintain her balance.     3.) Puts foot down- Etkins lowered her foot to the ground 4 times throughout the test after losing her balance.  Preliminary Breath Test:  Etkins was offered, and refused to take a Preliminary Breath Test.  Arrest:    Due to the above stated facts, I placed Etkins under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I conducted a search of her person, and placed her in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. Etkins began to protest my decision to place her under arrest, claiming her sprained ankle prevented her from performing well. I informed Etkins that a sprained ankle would not affect that nystagmus in her eyes, or prevent her from balancing on her uninjured foot. Etkins was then transported to Maryland State Police Barrack Q for DUI processing. Upon arrival at the barrack, an additional search of her person was performed in front of my supervisor. Etkins was then read her DR-15 Advise of Rights, and at 0229, Etkins refused to take the Alcohol Concentration Test. Etkins was then issued the appropriate documentation and released to a friend who possessed a valid Maryland drivers license.    Due to the above-mentioned facts, I request this case be closed by arrest.                                                                               All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
