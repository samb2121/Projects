         <NarrativeText>Attachments-    Digital photographs   Related report 23MSP003128  Scene Processing-     The burglarized structure is an older enclosed pole style large open bay garage building. The building is located on the north side of old scenic Rt. 40 across from Silver Spring Drive, Little Orleans, MD. The building has two established access points. The first beng a barn style large sliding doors and the other being a wooden standard size exterior door. Both access doors are located on the east side of the building and are not in clear view of the roadway. The exterior wooden door was open upon my arrival. I noticed the left side door frame had fresh damage in the area where the locking hasp would have been. The damage appeared to be consistent with pry marks such as a crow or pry bar. I observed an outdoor/exterior key entry lock (master lock) on the ground in front of the damaged door. This lock did not appear to be damaged. I observed on the door the locking hasp was still attached. I checked the inside of the building for any signs of a suspect and or evidence. I did not locate anyone inside the building. I observed miscellaneous construction martial of little to no value inside the building. It did not appear to me that any of the property had been disturbed. Photographs were taken of all these items and attached to this report. I also conducted a neighborhood check, which did not reveal any leads.  Neighborhood Check-   1. Paul Bowman (DOB:6/27/1935- (Home)301-478-2725)    33215 National Pike NE    Little Orleans, MD 21766       Mr. Bowmans property surrounds the State Shed on the north side. Unfortunately, the shed door broken into can not be seen from Mr. Bowmans property. I made contact with Mr. Bowman and advised him of the burglary. He said he was not familiar with the incident and did not recall seeing anything or anyone acting suspicious in the area. He did provide that he heard of with a recent burglary of a garage that occurred overnight on 1/25/2023, just a quarter of a mile west of his home. Mr. Bowman was unable to provide any further information.  2. 33312 National Pike NE    Little Orleans, MD 21766       I attempted to make contact with anyone at this residence. I learned from Mr. Bowman (neighborhood check #1) this trailer home in not occupied full time and only gets used during hunting season. He stated he has not seen the owner is several months.  3. 12903 Silver Spring Drive    Little Orleans, MD 21766       I attempted to make contact with anyone at this residence. I learned from Mr. Bowman (neighborhood check #1) this trailer home is currently vacant and has not been lived in for over a year.  Narrative:    On 1/27/2023 at 1512 hours, I, Sgt. Divelbiss was traveling west on Old Scenic Rt. 40 in the area of Silver Springs Drive. Little Orleans, MD. When I observed the exterior door to the SHA State owned storage shed open and no vehicle parked in the area. I stopped and further observed the area. I confirmed the entry door on the east side was partially open, and I could see a master lock lying on the ground in the area of the door. As I walked up to the building I noticed fresh pry mark damage to the left side of the door frame. I conducted a search of the building and was unable to locate any possible suspect(s). The damage to the door/frame is estimated to be $500.00. The above scene processing was conducted which did not produce any leads.     I contacted the LaVale State Highway office (301-729-8400) and spoke with Teresa the secretary to advise her of my findings. She advised she would contact a mobile crew to check the building and secure it. I later was contacted by area manager, Eric Minnick. Mr. Minnick said his crew did not find anything missing from inside the building and secured the door. Mr. Minnick was unable to provide any possible suspects.     I reviewed a burglary report investigated by S/T Michael #6292 (MSP-Cumberland Barrack) 23MSP003128. S/T Michaels report was taken on 1/25/2023, suspected to occurred overnight. In his incident the unknown suspect(s) used a pry bar that was recovered on scene, to gain access in a garage and two chainsaws were stolen. The pry bar from his case is similar in size as the pry marks I observed on the door frame of my incident.    No further action taken. Case Status: Suspended at this time, due to the lack of Suspect Information.                  </NarrativeText>
