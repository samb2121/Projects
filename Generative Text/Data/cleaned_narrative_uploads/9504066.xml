         <NarrativeText>The incident was audibly and visually recorded from my BWC. MSP unmarked unit D-24 is equipped with MVR equipment. DEFENDANT: BRAMMER, CHRISTOPHER JOSEPH ALLEN Date of Birth: 05/08/1997 (25 years old) Date of Arrest: 02/25/2023 Time of Arrest: 0227 hours DUI #: 23-053 (Bel Air Barrack, Harford County) Subsequent Offender: Yes (02/11/23 Citation #0GY0W1Q) Minor in the vehicle: No KY-DL. #B-22-585-340 CDL: No Certificate and Training: *I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with participants at the Maryland State Police Academy and prior DUI/DWI arrests and convictions. *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *RADAR / LIDAR Certified 2019. *Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) Operator Certified. *Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement Certified (ARIDE): Attended ARIDE with the Maryland State Police in January 2021 *UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND DUI INSTITUTE: I attended the University of Maryland DUI Institute, and I completed the course with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live participants (From June 5 to June 10, 2022) *Certified as SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge Martin H. Schreiber II in Baltimore City Circuit Court on September 27, 2022. *Certified SFST witness expert by Honorable Judge David E. Carey in Harford County District Court on October 11, 2022. *I have apprehended more than 160 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On February 25, 2023, at approximately 0204 hours, I, Trooper First Class Reckeweg # 7214 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Bel Air Barrack (unmarked MSP patrol vehicle D-24), was traveling in lane one (1) on southbound Route 543 prior to East Wheel Road. At that time, I observed a blue Chevrolet Pickup ahead of my patrol vehicle. The Chevrolet swerved to the right and went over the solid line dividing lane one (1) from the right shoulder by its tire width. The Chevrolet regained control but kept swerving within lane one (1). The Chevrolet swerved to the right and crossed the solid line dividing lane one (1) from the right shoulder. The Chevrolet regained control and returned to lane one (1). I conducted a traffic stop was initiated as I activated my emergency equipment. The Chevrolet stopped on the right shoulder of southbound Route 543 prior to Calvary Road, Bel Air, Harford County. I then observed the Chevrolet bearing Maryland registration 1328Z0. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Chevrolet via the passengers side window, made contact with the driver (only occupant), and explained to the driver the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver for his drivers license. The driver handed me a Kentucky drivers license and was identified as BRAMMER, CHRISTOPHER JOSEPH ALLEN (W/M, DOB 05/08/1997, Kentucky Soundex B-22-585-340) by his drivers license. I asked BRAMMER where he was coming from. BRAMMER advised that he was coming from Looneys Pub and going to his house in Aberdeen. While talking to BRAMMER, I instantly noticed his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from inside the Chevrolet. The drivers speech was slurred. BRAMMER advised that he had consumed that evening two Angry Orchard hard ciders and one shot thirty minutes prior to the traffic stop. I asked BRAMMER to exit and walk to the front of my patrol vehicle. BRAMMER stumbled while walking to the front of my patrol vehicle. At the front of my patrol vehicle, I could now detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on BRAMMERs breath and person. I advised BRAMMER that I had detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath and person. I observed BRAMMERs pants zipper was open. I observed BRAMMER having difficulty keeping his balance as he swayed from left to right. I advised BRAMMER that I would perform standardized field sobriety test (SFST) on him, which he agreed to submit. The summary of the first contact is as follows: Attitude: Cooperative Eye Condition: Glassy/bloodshot Mental State: Normal. Walk: Stumbling. Speech: Slurred. I asked BRAMMER the following questions: Medication- Yes (He stated that he was taking something like steroids but over the counter). Medical Conditions- Yes (Heart conditions) Glasses: No Any pain in the body- Yes (left shoulder) PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The below standardized field sobriety tests were performed on the right shoulder on the roadway. That area of the road was level and free of debris. Before beginning the standardized field sobriety tests below, I turned off my front emergency lights. The weather conditions were clear. Lighting conditions consisted of my patrol vehicle headlights and my flashlight. BRAMMER appeared in the good physical condition and displayed no visible signs of injury. I explained and demonstrated the standardized field sobriety tests below to BRAMMER. BRAMMER stated he understood my instructions and had no questions about the standardized field sobriety test. -HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) / (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: YES) The first test given was the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. The tip of my index finger from my right hand was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches from BRAMMERs eyes, slightly above his eyebrows. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. BRAMMERs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I observed his eyes to be red. BRAMMER was positioned to ensure passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked BRAMMER if he understood the instructions, and he stated, Yes. The following clues and observations were made during the test: Lack of Smooth Pursuit- Present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes The onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes Additional test Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- Present in both eyes -WALK AND TURN (WAT) / (5/8 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: Yes) Before BRAMMER performed the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. BRAMMER was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. BRAMMER was instructed and demonstrated to put his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until instructed to begin. BRAMMER was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on each step. BRAMMER was asked to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count each step out loud. On the ninth step, BRAMMER was explained, and I demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and planted and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around to his left. BRAMMER was again explained, and I demonstrated that the second series of nine (9) steps were to be completed identically to the first. Keep his hands by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. I asked BRAMMER if he understood the test. BRAMMER stated, Yes. BRAMMER was instructed to begin the test. Instructional Stage: Cannot Keep Balance: N/A Walking Stage (1st Nine) BRAMMER stepped offline on steps 2, 5, and 7. BRAMMER missed heel to toe by approximately 2 inches on step 4. BRAMMER stopped walking on step 9. Walking Stage (2nd nine): BRAMMER stepped offline on steps 3, 6, and 7. BRAMMER missed heel to toe by approximately 2 inches on steps 2, 4, and 8. BRAMMER raised their arms more than 6 inches on steps 5 and 6 Turn: Completed Unsatisfactory. BRAMMER did not leave his front foot planted and used both feet to walk in a circle. -ONE LEG STAND (OLS) (LEFT LEG) (3/4 CLUES OBSERVED) (INSTRUCTED  UNDERSTOOD / DEFENDANTS RESPONSE: Yes) Before BRAMMER performed the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. BRAMMER was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given during the test. BRAMMER was instructed to begin the test when he was asked to start and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to watch his raised foot and count out loud by thousands (thousand-one, thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked BRAMMER if he had any questions about the test (OLS) which he replied, no. BRAMMER raised his left foot. Instructional Stage: Nothing to report. Balance and Count Stage: 1. Sways: BRAMMER swayed on the 08 and 14-second mark. 2. Puts foot down: BRAMMER puts his foot down on the 11-second mark 3. Raise arms: BRAMMER raised his arms more than 6 inches on the 10, 14, 25, 27, and 29-second mark. -PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) (REFUSED)- The final test offered to BRAMMER was the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT). BRAMMER was advised that he could refuse this test. BRAMMER agreed to submit to the PBT with results of .11BrAC (0225 hours) ARREST Based on my knowledge, training, and experience as an MSP Trooper, previous DUI arrests, and clues gathered thus far, I had reason to believe BRAMMER was driving a motor vehicle while impaired (under the influence of Alcohol). *Swerving on the roadway. * Physical control of a motor vehicle. *admission of consumption of alcoholic beverages. *Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. *Bloodshot eyes. *Slurred speech. *Watery eyes. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed the standardized field sobriety. ARREST / ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15) / CERTIFIED BREATH TEST (AGREED)/ S/T WHITTENBERG #5397 (Maryland State Police). I arrested BRAMMER for driving under the influence of Alcohol at approximately 0227 hours. BRAMMER was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to Maryland State Police Bel Air-Barrack for processing, where a mouth check was performed 20 minutes before his submission to the breath test. BRAMMER was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights to follow along with as the DR-15 advice of rights was played to him from the official MVA website. At the conclusion of the DR-15, BRAMMER agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15, indicating the same at approximately 0250 hours. BRAMMER provided two breath examples with positive results of .10 BRAC. BRAMMER was given all copies of pertinent paperwork, and BRAMMER was released to a sober adult that came to Bel Air Barrack. At the Bel Air Barrack, BRAMMER stated that his uncle was the Chief of Police in Bel Air, and these charges would get dropped because of his influence in Law Enforcement in Harford County. INTOXIMETER RESULT: Results of .11 BRAC (0314 hours) BRAMMER was uncooperative during the processing. Case Status  Closed by arrest. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
