         <NarrativeText>Master Trooper Stevens initiated an investigation related to DSPII investigation:221610750-001, a case in which on June 3, 2022 at approximately 8:00 a.m., they delivered approximately five (5) kilograms of cocaine to 105 Scott Adam Road, Cockeysville, Maryland 21030. A subject identified as Lashae Danniece BROWN (2/13/1983), accepted the drug-laden parcel and was subsequently arrested.  BROWNs cellular telephone was seized and a search and seizure warrant was authored by a member of DSPII. The phone was forensically downloaded.  Master Trooper Stevens obtained a copy of the cellular telephone download and was able to determine that the subject who was the ultimate intended recipient of the aforementioned cocaine was Kobie Lee FARMER (DOB: 11/3/1976). Master Trooper Stevens was able to determine that FARMER has multiple addresses throughout the United States of America and is a significant wholesale CDS supplier.  Master Trooper Stevens utilized FBI C-4 analysists to subpoena telephone records related to FARMER, in an effort to find a current phone number for FARMER. Approximately 11 subpoenas were requested for phone and airline records. Phone records were uploaded into PLX and toll analysis was completed.  Through deconfliction protocols, it was determined that DEA Group 52 already had/has a significant case into the FARMER DTO and has made numerous large cocaine seizures, as well as seizures of bulk currency and firearms.  On November 17, 2023, Master Trooper Stevens met with DEA Special Agent Don Quarles and Group 52s analyst. Master Trooper Stevens provided Group 52 with a PLX arc file and a copy of DSPIIs cellular telephone download from BROWNs arrest. DEA advised that no further assistance was necessary. There is nothing further to report.  CASE CLOSED </NarrativeText>
