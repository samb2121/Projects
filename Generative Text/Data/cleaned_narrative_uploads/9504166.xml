         <NarrativeText> On 2/13/2023 at approximately 1042 hours I was traveling in the area of southbound Route 13 in the area of Lake Somerset Avenue located in Westover, Maryland when I was alerted by my mobile tag readers of a suspended registration. A MVA check of Maryland registration 897Z94 was confirmed the registration was suspended. The vehicle was observed as a blue GMC Yukon. I noticed the vehicle immediately slow down and make a U turn and start back northbound. I then turn around and caught back up to the vehicle in which the vehicle was stopped on northbound Route 13 just north of Old Princess Anne Road.    Contact was made with the driver who was identified as Anthony Thomas Mixter. Mixter was advised he was being audio and visually recorded and of the reason for the stop. Mixter stated he did not have a license and that he was currently suspended. A wanted check revealed Mixter was wanted out of Baltimore County for violation of probation. The warrant was confirmed and Mixter was taken into custody without incident. The front seat passenger was identified as Maria Lyn Church. Church was unable to provide proof of insurance, and it was learned there was a pickup order for the tags for insurance violation. Church advised she did not care who towed the vehicle and therefore Smullens Towing responded to the scene tow the vehicle. The tags were removed from the vehicle and returned to the MVA.    At this time Mixter was transported to the Princess Anne Barrack where it was learned Baltimore County had faxed a detainer for Mixter to be transported directly to the Somerset County Detention Center to be held until Baltimore County could respond to transport Mixter back to Baltimore. Upon arriving at the barrack and Mixter stated he had a prescription for Suboxone and that he is a patient at Capricorn Health out of Salisbury, Maryland. Mixter stated he had a dose of Suboxone in his wallet. The Suboxone was found in his wallet. I then contactedCapricorn Health, and they confirmed Mixter is a patient and is prescribed Suboxone. The Suboxone was open and there was only a small amount in the package. Mixter was advised the Suboxone would have to be destroyed because he would not be able to take it into the detention center. The Suboxone was stored at the barrack on PH P-341707 per rules and regulation to be destroyed.    At this time Mixter was taken to the Somerset County Detention center where he was released into their custody. Case closed, all paperwork has been attached to this report under attachments. </NarrativeText>
