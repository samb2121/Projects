         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack P This incident was captured by body-worn-camera  Suspect: Christian David Adamo (W/M DOB: 03/03/1979)  Victim: The State of Maryland.  Scene processing: During this incident, no scene evidence was collected by the initial responding Troopers.  Neighborhood Check: Trooper Tenney, and I responded from the Glen Burnie District Court House to 125 Faywood Ct Apartment B, Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, Maryland to contact Adamo. Upon arrival, members of the Anne Arundel County Police Department were already speaking with Adamo.  Narrative: On November 8th, 2023, at approximately 1217 hours. Troopers from the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack P were dispatched to the Glen Burnie District Courthouse located at 7500 Ritchie Highway, Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, Maryland for reports of mass violence. I, Trooper First Class A. J. Baldi #6907 was the first to arrive on-scene.  I contacted the lead bailiff, Timothy Rzepka, who was standing in front of the building upon my arrival. Rzepka stated, a subject named, Christian David Adamo (W/M DOB: 03/03/1979) contacted the Department of Social Services via telephone and made threats towards the civilians and staff of the courthouse. Rzepka said the incident was reported to him due to the severity of the threats made. Rzepka stated Adamo called saying he was going to shoot everyone at the facility and possibly blow the courthouse up.  To gain a better understanding of the incident, I requested to speak with the original call taker. When I entered the facility, Trooper Tenney #7378, and Trooper First Class K. Kazubski #6859 arrived and took up positions at the front entrance in case Adamo followed through with his threats. Mr. Rzepka and I attempted to locate the call take from Social Services and were unable to locate her.  Trooper Tenney and I were requested to respond to Adamos home address, 125 Faywood Ct Apartment B, Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, Maryland to contact Adamo. Upon arrival, members of the Anne Arundel County Police Department were already speaking with Adamo.  While interacting with him, it was revealed through a METERS/NCIC check, Adamo had multiple active arrest warrants for failing to appear for court. I was briefed, that members from the MSP Criminal Enforcement Division Central-south were responding to contact Adamo. Once CED arrived on scene, Cpl Z. Null #6149 took over the role as the primary investigator.  Case closed.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

It was learned that an individual identified as Christian David Adamo, W/M, DOB: 03/03/1979, made threats of mass violence to everyone at the Maryland Department of Social Services located inside the Glen Burnie District Courthouse.  Investigators with the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division- Central South Region were notified of the incident and requested for the case.  I, TFC Hussey #6913 contacted the lead Glen Burnie District Courthouse bailiff Timothy Rzepka, who advised he called 911 once bailiff James Mcneill notified him of the threat. Bailiff Mcneill was notified of the threat by an unknown employee with the Maryland Department of Social Services. Lead Bailiff Timothy Rzepka did not know the employees name who received the phone call and spoke with Adamo.  Troopers from the Glen Burnie Barrack and officers with the Anne Arundel County Police Department responded to 125 Faywood Court Apt. B, Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, MD 21060 and located Adamo. The Glen Burnie Barrack Police Communication Officer (PCO) confirmed Adamo had an active bench warrant (No. D220493486) (02CK0NTY)through Baltimore City for failing to appear for court on 07/07/2022 for the following charges TA 16.101.A1 (Driving/ Attempting to drive) motor vehicle on highway without required license and authorization, TA 17.107.A1 Knowingly driving uninsured vehicle, and TA 14.107.K Attaching unauthorized veh. reg. plate with intent to conceal, misrepresent veh. owner ID. Tpr. Litz #7362 arrested Adamo at approximately 1337 hours and transported Adamo to the Glen Burnie Barrack for processing. In Adamos possession was a black/yellow Xmobile cellular phone, unknown serial number. Adamos cellular phone was later seized and a search warrant will be written for information relating to this incident. Adamos cellular phone was processed according to MSP policy and procedure and is currently stored at the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack. See Tpr. Litzs supplement to this report for voluntary statements from Adamo while being transported.  I then responded to the Maryland Department of Social Services office located inside the Glen Burnie District Courthouse, where I spoke with office clerk supervisor Ayreonna Terry. Terry advised her employee Lisa Hansel (office service clerk) is the one who took the phone call with Adamo. Hansel advised she was working the front desk, when Adamo called between 11:00am- 12:00pm. Hansel stated that Adamo identified himself by giving his name and social security number. Hansel advised Adamos reason for calling was about his temporary disabilities assistance program case; he had not received any funds yet. Hansel stated that she helped Adamo with some paperwork the week prior in person in the office (possibly November 2nd or 3rd). Hansel then advised Adamo that their records show that he still needed to turn paperwork in, which Adamo stated he had already turned all his paperwork in. Hansel advised that Adamo started to get agitated and was able to tell by his voice. Hansel told Adamo that he can bring the forms or show his receipts of the completed forms to the office. Hansel then advised at that point, Adamo made comments that he was bi-polar and that his mom was murdered. Hansel then advised Adamo made a comment to her of what he needed to do, slash his throat in front of her and shoot everybody with a gun. Hansel advised that was the end of the phone call and she hung up, the phone call lasted approximately 3 to 4 minutes long. Terry advised that Adamo completed the form DHS/FIA 500-C incorrectly and needed to complete form DHA/FIA 340. Terry spoke with her IT department and they advised their phone calls are not recorded. Terry advised to be able to receive their phone log information and Adamos records that I would need a subpoena for them.  I then responded to 125 Faywood Court Apt. B, Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, MD 21060, where Tuesday Louise Quinones, W/F, DOB: 06/17/1969 gave consent to search the apartment. Investigators and Troopers conducted a search of the apartment and a letter from the Maryland Department of Human Services was the only piece of evidence taken. The letter was made out to Christian D Adamo, 125 Faywood Ct Apt B, Glen Burnie MD 21060 and has a due date of 11/09/2023 for programs SNAP and Cash Assistance. There are three listed required documents needed which are 1-(Cash Assistance) DHS FIA 340 authorization for reimbursement of interim assistance, 2- (SNAP) The agency has received your TDAP/cash application in order to be determined for cash benefits you must have your doctor complete the 500 medical form mailed to you this day and must complete the 340 and apply for all programs with social security administration, and 3- (Cash Assistance) DHS FIA 500C medical report verification form. Quinones was given her signed copy of the form MSP 78 (Maryland State Police Consent to Search and Seize). Quinones advised she was at the apartment when Adamo was talking to the employee at the Maryland Department of Social Services. Quinones advised she walked out of the room during the phone call due to Adamo yelling and was only able to hear part of the conversation. Quinones advised the only phones they own are their personal cellular phones, each having one cellular phone. Quinones allowed investigators to look through her phone and there were no phone calls to DSS on 11/08/2023. Quinones described Adamos cellular phone to be black/yellow with the phone number of 443-623-1630. Quinones advised she heard Adamo tell the call taker, What do I have to do, come down there and slit my wrists.  An arrest warrant was applied for and issued for Adamo for the following criminal charge: 1_1335 CR 3-1001 Threat of mass violence  Adamo was then transported to the Anne Arundel County- Jennifer Road Detention Center located at 131 Jennifer Road, Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, MD 21401.  On 11/17/2023, honorable judge Kemp Hammond of the Annapolis District Court signed a search warrant for Adamos cellular phone. On 11/20/2023, I brought Adamos cellular phone to the Technical Investigations Section to be downloaded.  On 11/22/2023, I served the Maryland Department of Social Services two subpoenas, 1- call log information on 11/08/2023 for 443-623-1630 at the Glen Burnie office and 2- certified copies of all records for Adamo.  I request this case to remain open, pending the search warrant on Adamos cellular phone and subpoena results.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, MD. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>In-Car Camera Operational. Trooper #7362 BWC camera was functioning and used during this incident. Marked Patrol Vehicle P-9 is also equipped with an inward facing camera, which was functioning and used during this event.    EVIDENCE:  The following was captured on Marked Patrol Vehicle P-9s in-car camera system after Adamo was notified that he was being audibly and visually recorded.    COMPLAINANT/VICTIM:  State of Maryland.    NARRATIVE:  On 11/08/2023, at approximately 1321 hours, I, Trooper Litz #7362, responded to 125 Faywood Court Apt B, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, for threats of violence and a potential warrant service. I made contact with Christian David Adamo (W/M DOB: 03/03/1979) outside of the building. Multiple other police officers were already on scene and had been talking with Adamo rior to my arrival. It was brought to my attention that Adamo had an open warrant through Baltimore for failing to appear in court. At approximately 1315 hours, the warrant had been confirmed as active.  At approximately 1337 hours, I placed Adamo under arrest for the active warrant. Per Maryland State Police (MSP) policy, Adamo was placed in the front passengers seat of my marked patrol vehicle, P-9, for transport to the Glen Burnie barrack of MSP for further processing and criminal charging. Upon me starting to drive to the barrack with Adamo, he began talking about an active case regarding threats of mass violence to social service workers at the Glen Burnie Courthouse. I immediately informed Adamo that, as the Trooper affecting the warrant, I was not investigating or questioning him regarding the active case against him. Additionally, I informed Adamo that any statements he made would be of his own free will, unprompted by me and would be recorded. I then continued to the Glen Burnie barrack of the Maryland State Police with Adamo.  While en route to the barrack, Adamo began speaking to me about many topics. One of the first things Adamo stated while in my patrol vehicle was You know this dumb woman at Social Services just woke up a sleeping giant because Im gonna bury her While continuing to talk about a specific person, Adamo also stated ...I hope something happens in your life one day where you think about what you did At approximately 1359 hours, I arrived at the barrack with Adamo, where he was held for processing before transport to the Anne Arundel County Department of Corrections (DOC). At approximately 1604 hours, Adamo was placed back into my marked patrol vehicle, P-9, to be transported to DOC. I arrived at DOC with Adamo at approximately 1634 hours, where he was processed into DOCs custody and given copies of all pertinent paperwork.   All events listed above occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.    </NarrativeText>
