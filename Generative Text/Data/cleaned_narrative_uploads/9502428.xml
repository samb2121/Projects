         <NarrativeText>MSP unmarked vehicle Q-41 is equipped with a mobile recording device. Body worn camera worn and operational.    Defendant: Chinedu Emezue  Date of Birth: 02/14/1981  Date of Arrest: 10/22/2023  Time of Arrest: 0238 hours  DUI #: 23-251   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Sunday, October 22, 2023, at approximately 0213 hours, I, Trooper Webb of the Maryland State Police  College Park Barrack was on routine patrol in my unmarked MSP vehicle Q-41 in lane three of the I-495 prior to Route 1. At this time, I observed a blue Mercedes-Benz bearing Maryland registration 4EF7637 in lane four. The vehicle would cross over the white dotted lane dividers four times. The Mercedes-Benz crossed over each time by a tire width for a few seconds before correcting itself back into lane four. The Mercedes-Benz would cross from lane four to lane three, three times and from lane four to the shoulder area one time. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle. After turning on my lights, the vehicle pulled off the roadway to the right and onto the shoulder and came to a complete stop. After the vehicle came to a complete stop I made contact with the driver.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the operator via the passenger side window and upon my approach I immediately smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I gave the driver my rank, name, ID number, agency and I informed the driver the reason for the stop. I also advised him the stop was being audibly/visually recorded. I requested his license and registration card. The driver was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Chinedu Emezue. I asked Emezue how much he had to drink and he would intentionally avoid answering the question each time.As I spoke to Emezue, I intentionally observed his eyes to be glassy and bloodshot with a gazed look and noticed his head and body movements were slow and lethargic. I returned to my patrol vehicle and conducted routine checks on Emezue.  I approached the vehicle again and requested Emezue exit his vehicle and walk to the front of his vehicle, to which he complied.I continued to speak with Emezue outside his vehicle and asked him again how much he had to drink earlier and he continued to not answer the question. As Emezue spoke, I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.I informed Emezue that I wanted him to perform field sobriety tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the shoulder of the Beltway. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 50 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of street lamps, patrol vehicle headlamps, spotlight, and my flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Emezue appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Emezue the following questions:  Injuries  No Medication  No Medical Conditions  Astigmatism Glasses - No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pointer finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Emezues eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Emezues pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed. He was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Emezue if he understood the instructions, and he stated yes.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) Prior to Emezue performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Emezue was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Emezue was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Emezue was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Emezue was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Emezue was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Emezue was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Emezue was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Emezue if he understood the test, and he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Feet broke apart 2.) Began test before instructed.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Stepped off the line by more than a width of foot on steps 2, and 3. 2.) Missed heel to toe by more than an inch on steps 2, and 3. 3.) Took 4 steps instead of the instructed 9 steps.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Stepped off the line by more than a width of foot on steps 1, 2, 3, and 4. 2.) Missed heel to toe by more than an inch on steps 1. 2, 3, and 4. 3.) Took 4 steps instead of the instructed 9 steps.  Turn: 1.) Improper - turned in one fluid motion to the left and began to stagger his feet and lean backwards.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) Prior to Emezue performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Emezue was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Emezue if he understood the test and he stated yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Nothing to report.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Placed foot down on the ground.  Seconds 11-20: 1.) Swayed body to the left and right. 2.) Placed foot down on the ground. 3.) Began hopping in place.  Seconds 21-30: 1.) Swayed body to the left and right. 2.) Placed foot down on the ground.  Emezue refused to submit to a preliminary breath test.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Emezue was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  * Swerving vehicle multiple times. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from vehicle. * Slow and lethargic head and body movements. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot with a gazed look. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.  I arrested Emezue for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0238 hours, and he was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Maryland State Police  College Park Barrack for processing. Once at the barrack, I played the English audio DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Emezue in its entirety. At the conclusion of the form, Emezue verbally advised that he would not submit to the intoximeter test and signed the form indicating the same.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the observation period on Emezue in its entirety starting with his time of arrest. I escorted Emezue into the arrest processing room and remained in his custody until the time of test. Emezues mouth was checked and no foreign objects or piercings were observed.  Emezue was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and later released to his brother.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
