At that time, I observed a gray Honda car bearing MD registration 8CP9623 approaching from the opposite direction, headed northbound on Route 13. The vehicle crossed over the double yellow line by over a tire length and was partially headed into oncoming traffic before returning to its designated lane. I turned around and began following the vehicle northbound on Route 13 at which point the vehicle crossed over the double yellow line by approximately a tire length once more. I then activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle, northbound Route 13 at Broad Street.  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Phase #2 - Personal Contact:   I immediately exited my vehicle and contacted the driver, identified by his Maryland Drivers license as James Alan Cooper (W/M 10/01/1967). I identified myself to Cooper, why I had stopped him and that he was being audibly and visually recorded. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from inside the vehicle. I asked Cooper for his license and registration. While he searched for these items I asked Cooper where he was coming from that evening. Cooper advised he had just finished playing in a pool/billiards tournament and that he had tied for first place. I then asked Cooper how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that evening at the tournament. Cooper advised he hadnt consumed any and that he does not drink. I advised Cooper that I detected the odor of the beverages. I confirmed Coopers address on his license as current. As I began to turn to return to my vehicle, I then noticed a bright green bag on the passenger seat of the vehicle. I identified this bag as a Crown Royal bag through my training, knowledge and experience. I know Crown Royal to be a brand of alcoholic beverage. I questioned Cooper about the bag containing the Crown Royal bottle, to which he responded that it was his wifes and that I could feel that it was warm if I liked. I then returned to my patrol vehicle and provided driver information to MSP Salisbury Barrack. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  When I returned to the vehicle, I asked Cooper to step out of the vehicle. I advised Cooper the reason for getting him out of the vehicle. I observed that Cooper had a prosthetic leg for his left leg. I asked Cooper if he wanted to/or was able perform standardized field sobriety tests given his prosthetic. Cooper agreed to attempt to perform standardized field sobriety tests. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Pre-Screening Questions: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  I asked Cooper a series of questions prior to performing Standardized Field Sobriety Tests: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; * Visual check of inside of Coopers mouth: Clear * Glasses: Cooper had been wearing glasses and advised that the car accident which had taken his leg gave him head trauma which made him unable to follow visual stimulus for Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. * Injuries: Left leg  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus:   font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues:Unable to Perform  Walk and Turn: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  Cooper advised he could not complete Walk and Turn due to his prosthetic leg. Walk and Turn: Unable to Complete  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; One Leg Stand: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Cooper. I asked Cooper if he understood the test. I advised Cooper that he could use his right leg to complete the test rather than have to use the prosthetic. Cooper raised his left foot to begin the test. Seconds 1-10: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Swayed Put Foot Down Raised Arms  After approximately five seconds, Cooper discontinued the test stating Nope, it aint gone happen. I again reminded Cooper that his right leg was should still be okay because it is being used alone. Cooper stated that he could not complete the test.   Total One Leg Stand Clues:3 of 4 font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; Preliminary Breath Test    I explained to Cooper the reasons for using a preliminary breath test and asked if he wanted to submit a breath sample. Cooper advised me that he would submit to a Preliminary Breath Test. Cooper submitted a breath alcohol reading of .143. While waiting for the Preliminary Breath Test, I once again asked Cooper how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that evening. Cooper stated Alright Ill be honest with ya, I had one Crown Royal apple - while he was playing pool. I asked Cooper how drunk he believed himself to be on a scale from one to ten. Cooper responded a one or a two.   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Cooper was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  *Coopers driving behavior * Alcoholic beverage in the passenger seat of the vehicle. * The odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle and his breath and person. * Admittance to consuming an alcoholic beverage. * My observed signs of impairment font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  I placed Cooper under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0138 hours. I placed Cooper in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle.  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; 20 Minute Observation Period: font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;  Upon arrival at Maryland State Police Barrack E, I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights to Cooper. Cooper advised he would submit to the intoximeter test. At 0218 hours, Coopers breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.Cooper was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to a sober driver.  font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt; All events did occur in Wicomico County, Maryland. font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" /&gt;   </NarrativeText>
