         <NarrativeText>DUI # : 23-58-136 Tape # : Incident Recorded on Axon Body Worn Camera (DUI Hernandez Santos) Weather : Clear / Night Priors: N/A  NARRATIVE  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):  Please see Tpr. Stacey #7390 supplement report.   During the time of this traffic stop, the weather was clear and approximately 79 degrees, the roadway was dry, and precipitation was 0 inches from the previous 24 hours. Weather information taken from Weather Underground.Com    PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):  Upon my arrival to Tpr. Stacey on June 25, 2023 at approximately 2143 hours, he had already gotten the driver identified as Mario Hernandez-Santos (11/15/1999, 5/M) out of the car and walked him to the rear of the vehicle. I made contact with Hernandez Santos, observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy, and detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person.   I asked Hernandez Santos if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages this evening, which he stated to me he only had dos cervesas and that he consumed two Bud lights in Ocean City. I attempted to explain to Hernandez Santos that I was requesting he perform field sobriety testing to ensure he was safe to drive but to a language barrier, it was difficult to communicate with him.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):  The tests were completed on the Shoulder of Route 50 on a hard flat surface that was free from any debris. The front emergency lights of Staceys patrol vehicle were turned off and Hernandez Santos was directed to face away from oncoming traffic. It was not determined that Hernandez Santos wore glasses or contacts, was taking any prescription medication, or have any prior injuries because of the language barrier.    HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: N/A  During the test, I held my finger approximately 12-15 inches from Hernandez Santos nose and slightly above eye level. He displayed equal pupils however; he failed to keep his head still to follow my finger. I attempted multiple times to check Hernandez Santos eyes for Lack of Smooth Pursuit, Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation, and Onset of Nystagmus prior to 90 degrees. I explained in several different ways that he needed to keep his head still, I demonstrated following my finger and keeping his head still, and I typed the instructions to google translate on a cell phone. Hernandez Santos continued to move his head while attempting to follow my finger.    WALK AND TURN: 5/8 Clues Observed  I attempted to explain to Hernandez Santos the nine step walk and turn. I advised him to take his right foot and place in front of his left foot, touching heel to toe. Hernandez Santos to several attempts to get into the instructional position. I explained and demonstrated him the test and utilized google translate to explain portions of it.   Instructional Phase:   Starts too soon-Hernandez Santos begins the test prior to finishing explaining instructions.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Unable to Keep Balance-Hernandez Santos steps out of instructional position after losing balance.   Walking Phase:    Steps Off Line-Hernandez Santos stepped off-line while walking  Incorrect Number of Steps-Hernandez Santos completed 3 steps.   Improper Turn-Hernandez Santos did not complete a turn.    ONE LEG STAND:   Hernandez Santos did not complete the One Leg Stand.   ARREST: Based off my observations, I placed Hernandez Santos in custody for driving under the influence of alcohol at 2159 hours. I transported him to the Easton Barrack and played the Spanish audio version of the Advice of Rights DR 15 form at 2205 hours. Upon our arrival at the barrack, I asked Hernandez Santos three times on google translate in Spanish if he would like to take an alcohol concentration test. All three times, he stated si and at 2216 hours, he agreed to take the alcohol concentration test.  At 2229 hours, Hernandez Santos submitted to the alcohol concentration test with a result of .22 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. I provided Hernandez Santos a copy of all of his paperwork and he was released to a sober driver at Easton Barrack.     I am a certified police officer in the state of Maryland with over 40 hours of training in DUI detection with live donors at the Maryland State Police Academy. I have also completed an additional 16 hours of Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training through the Maryland State Police. I have also completed 8 hours of Advanced DUI Enforcement training through the Maryland State Police State Police Impaired Driving Effort (SPIDRE) Team. My training, knowledge, and experience have led to several prior DUI arrests and subsequent convictions.    </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>This incident was recorded via L-41 MVR and bodyworn camera  On June 25, 2023, at approximately 2133 hours, I, Stacey #7390 of the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack was traveling westbound on US Route 50 prior to Beaver Dam Road in Trappe, Talbot County, Maryland when I observed a silver Toyota Camry bearing Delaware registration XQ419238,unable to maintain a single lane of traffic. I observed a traffic backup of approximately 6-8 cars behind the Toyota Camry going approximately 10-15 mph under the posted speed limit of 55 mph. At this time, I noticed the Toyota Camry could not maintain a single lane and was traveling between lanes 1 and 2, causing other vehicles to brake and go around the Camry. At this time I used my agency issued radio and requested another unit from the Easton Barrack as I was en route to my patrol area for night shift. I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle and the driver took a very prolonged amount of time to pull over.</NarrativeText>
