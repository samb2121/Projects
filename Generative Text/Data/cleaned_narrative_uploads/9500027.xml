On Friday, August 18, 2023 at approximately 0923 hours, I contacted Kerrin Kelsey by phone to conduct an interview.

She advised there were a large amount of transactions more then the 3 transactions I found in Venmo. Kelsey explained that she didnt not have any money in her bank account so Venmo fronted the suspects account the money. She stated the suspect made notes on the transactions of friends names and nicknames in an attempt to make the transactions appear normal. I asked her when these transactions occurred, which she advised the beginning of May.   I then directed her attention to timeframe of Thursday, May 4 to Tuesday, May 9, as the transactions from Venmo occurred during that timeframe. I asked her to give a run through of where she went and who she was with during those dates.

Carter #6361, was dispatched to a reported theft/fraud. I contacted Victim #1, Tina Kelsey, whom advised her daughter, Victim #2, Kerrin Kelsey, Venmo account had been accessed. Tina Kelsey stated there were three transaction Kerrin Kelsey did not conduct. The Venmo app showed the three transactions transferred money to a Tomas Jones with a username of @Ytn_1. The Venmo transactions caused the associated WesBanco bank account to be overdrawn and incurred overdraft fees. Both Tina and Kerrin Kelsey are account holders on the WesBanco account and live at 8731 Green Valley Rd., Union Bridge, Frederick County, MD 21791.   I submitted subpoenas to Venmo for the usernames of both Kerrin Kelsey and Tomas Jones. I received information regarding three accounts, one being Kelseys and the other two belonging to the suspect. Venmo showed suspect account 1 being held by Dario Belizaire (DOB 02/13/2004) opened on 05/05/2023. Suspect account 2 was held by times jones (DOB 02/13/2004) opened on 09/22/2022. Both accounts shared the same mailing address, social security number and date of birth. I was able to check various law enforcement databases to obtain a full name of Dario James Belizaire (DOB 02/13/2004 B/M).    Review of the transaction lists from all of the accounts revealed the following. On 05/05/2023 and 05/09/2023, there were three transactions from Kerrin Kelseys account to suspect account 1. The total amount of the three transactions was $487.00. This amount was then transferred in two transactions to suspect account 2. Then there was a transaction from suspect account 2 to Iam Wrexx for an amount of $450.00 with a note of Tattoo.    I then conducted a phone interview with Kerrin Kelsey. She verified the transactions in question advising it was a large sum of money compared to her normal transaction amounts. We then discussed her daily routine, events and people she was in contact with for the timeframe of 05/04/2023 to 05/9/2023. Kerrin Kelsey identified Belizaire as someone she as an intimate relationship with. She further advised they knew each other because he was a football player and she was a cheerleader. She stated Belizaire spent the night in her dorm room on 05/04/2023 to 05/05/2023 at Salisbury University. On a later date Kerrin Kelsey located a $5.00 Apple Cash transaction to Belizaire that occurred on 05/05/2023 at 0230 hours. Venmo showed two transactions between 0633 and 0640 hours on the morning of 05/05/2023. Kerrin Kelsey advised Belizaire left for weight lifting practice at approximately 0630 hours. Again on 05/09/2023, Kerrin Kelsey believed Belizaire also spent the night in her dorm room. The third transaction occurred on 05/09/2023 at 0627 hours. Kerrin Kelsey advised Belizaire knew the passcode to her phone since November 2022 and it was a simple passcode. Kerrin Kelsey advised Belizarie did not have consent to transfer money to himself.   I obtained a subpoena for transactions information for Apple Cash of Kerrin Kelsey account, associated with phone number 240-439-7152. I received the account information and transaction history from Green Dot Corporation. The account listed Kerrin Kelsey as the owner. I had requested a time frame of 05/03/2023 to 05/05/2023, during which there were 3 transactions. All three transactions occurred on 05/04/2023 within a couple minutes, 2323 hours to 2324 hours (PST). The first two transaction were for $300.00 and $100.00, respectively, which both failed. The last transaction was for $6.00 and was successful. All 3 transactions were going to account number 3630608335677456, owned by Dario Belizaire.  On 01/09/2024, I submitted an application of charges to the Frederick County Commissioners Office. The commissioner issued a criminal summons for the below charges. CED Lower Eastern Shore has made several attempts to conduct a knock and talk with Belizaire. They will continue attempt to interview Belizaire and will be forwarded the criminal summons for service.
