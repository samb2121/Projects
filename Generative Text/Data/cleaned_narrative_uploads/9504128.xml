         <NarrativeText>   On 2/8/2023, I received a referral from the Child Advocacy Center at the Garrett County Department of Human Services. The referral was initiated by Shannon Haley, a School Social Worker, and a Registered School Nurse, Anna Anderson, at the Broadford Elementary School. The referral was in regard to the suspected child abuse and/or neglect of a minor. It was reported a child, identified as Timothy Lea Smith(10), reported to school with several marks and bruises on his body. Timothy made several disclosures about his non-biological parent causing his existing injuries and how the family interacts at their home. The following was reported in the report of suspected child abuse.   Timothy reported to school and was observed to have a very dark purple and blue bruising on his left ear. Timothy also hada less severe bruising on his right ear. Timothy was also observed to havean abrasion on his eyelid that was red. Timothy reported he had manyinjuries occurring to him. Timothy reported through his own way of communicating,he hit himself, his dad would grab his hands and make him hit himself, and his sister has injured him.  The report indicated multiple reports were filed to DHS regarding physical abuse and/or neglect. The most recent case involved DHS Worker, Joshua Hazelwood, from In-Home Family Services. Allegations were made from the most recentinvestigationalleging Timothy was struck by his dad and Timothy sustained a bloody nose.  Timothy reportedhe gets in trouble with his family for running his mouth. Timothy made several referencesadvising, What happens on the farm stays on the farm.  Timothy disclosedhe has stood for hours in his bedroom for punishment. Timothy advised his Dad thought hewas trying to fall asleep and his Dad got mad at him. Timothy also reported he has urinated on himself in the past because he does not have access to a bathroom.     On 2/7/2023, Timothy was seen by the School Nurse, Anna Anderson (RN), in regard to his injuries.     Upon receiving this report, the Department of Human Services assigned John Sherbin as the Child Protective Worker.     On 2/8/2023, John Sherbin and I responded to the Broadford Elementary School and spoke with Timothy Lea Smith(10). As Timothy walked into the room, Timothy presented as a slim male child. Timothys clothes appeared to be dirty with several unknown stains on his clothing. Timothy was immediately recognized to have a few scratches/abrasions on his face. Timothy was also observed to have an abrasion on his right eyelid and bruising on both of his ears. Timothy had a bruise on his ear, which covered half of his left ear, and another lesser bruise on the top of his right ear. Upon asking Timothy about his injuries, he disclosed he was slapped by my Dad. Timothy advised his Dad was known as Jack James Hebb. As Timothy spoke to us, it appeared Timothy had a speech impediment and an eye condition causing his eyes to move independently. Timothy was asked how he was slapped. Timothy stated Jack James Hebb was hitting him in the head and causing injuries to his ears and face. Timothy further explained and demonstrated to us his dad would curl his fingers inward (in an open fist) and slap him on both sides of his head, with both of his hands. Timothy advised this has happened to him on multiple occasions. Timothy advised on this last occasion he believed he was struck around Saturday (2/4/2023). As Timothy was asked how many times he was struck on his ears this last time, Timothy advised he was struck more than one time by both of his Dads hands. Photographs were taken of Timothys injuries by John Sherbin. I was present. The photographs will be placed in the case file. The photographs were also uploaded into Veripic.     Upon investigating this report of child abuse and neglect and observing the injuries to Timothy Lea Smith, the Garrett County Department of Human Services made a decision to immediately remove Timothy Smith(10) from the care and custody of Jack James Hebb and Tammy Hebb. A Petition was filed and an Emergency Family Court Hearing will be held on 2/9/2023.     After Timothy was placed into care, Timothy was taken from the Broadford Elementary School and transported by John Sherbin to be medically evaluated by Dr. Stephanie Sisler. Upon evaluating Timothys injuries, Dr. Sisler concluded the injuries were most likely caused by the infliction of another person. A medical report and the findings forwarded to MD CHAMPS is pending.     All events did occur in Garrett County, MD.     Case remains open.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>     On 2/15/2023, I responded to the residence of Jack James Hebb II and Tammy Hebb. Upon my arrival, I made contact with Tammy Hebb. I informed Tammy about my investigation and why I was present. Tammy advised she was aware of the Department of Human Services being involved and an upcoming court case regarding allegations regarding Timothy Smith. I advised Tammy my investigation was a separate criminal investigation involving both her and her husband. Tammy advised she understood. Tammy advised she was instructed not to have any conversations with law enforcement pertaining to this investigation. Tammy advised they had obtained separate counsel and advised they may decide to be in touch at a later time through counsel. I left without incident.       On 2/15/2023, I received a copy of the medical examination completed, on 2/8/2023, by Dr. Sisler. The report was placed in the case file with all the images taken of the physical injuries during the medical examination. The report indicated, but was not limited to, the following.       Timothy Smith, 10 years old - 11/2/2012  Problems listed as - Speech and language disorder.                 Strabismus.                 Contusion of left ear.                 Contusion of right ear.                 Contusion of orbital tissue of the right eye.                 Suspected victim of child abuse.     Height - 52 inches (12th percentile), Weight 60 pounds (14th percentile), BMI 15.8 (30th percentile)    Timothy was reportedly asked byDr. Sislerif his injuries to his eye, his left ear, and his right forehead,hurt. Timothy was also askedwhy those injuries hurt. Timothydisclosed, Yeah, my dad slapped me.    Poor hygiene noted of teeth.    Strabismus noted with extraocular movements.    Patient was observed by Dr. Sisler to have multiple areas of bruising noted on examination, along with a described instance of physical abuse self reported by Timothy Smith as inflicted by dad.The history and the examination was reported to be most consistent with non-accidental injury.       All the findings in the medical evaluation by Dr. Sisler was sent to MD CHAMP for suspected child abuse and/or neglect. Upon viewing the material, the medical evaluators were in total agreement with these injuries being non-accidental and a result of abuse.       An Emergency Shelter Care Hearing was completed on 2/9/2023 in Family Court. Upon completion of this hearing, Timothy Smith remained in the care and custody of the Garrett County Department of Human Services and was placed into Foster Care. A Child In Need Of Assistance Hearing is scheduled for 3/7/2023.      In conversing with several members of the Broadford Elementary School Staff, it was required to further investigate the statements Timothy made to show how Timothy progressed through his explanations. It was believed Timothy was fearful in having to explain his obvious injuries to school personnel and he was concerned about having to deal with his family members response if he had explained his injuries to someone at the school. Timothy was initially reluctant to speak when he was asked to speak about his injuries. As Timothy was observed to have injuries, he was sent to the school nurse for treatment. During Timothys initial conversations with the school nurse, who was identified as Anna Anderson, Timothy gave an explanation that his hands caused his injuries. Anna stated Timothys injuries did not appear self-inflicted and Timothys explanation appeared suspicious in nature. After treating Timothy, Anna reported Timothys injuries and his explanation to the Principal, Megan Knepp. The Principal requested further conversations be made with Timothy and recommended Kandice Smith and/or Shannon Haley speak with Timothy to determine what had occurred to him. When Kandice spoke to Timothy, Timothy was reluctant and stated he was injured by his three year old sister when a door hit him. Kandice reported Timothys explanation did not appear accurate due to the extent and the placement of Timothys injuries. Timothys injuries were present over several locations on his head, face, and ears. Kandice did not believe the injuries were caused by a three year old child and/or were self-inflicted. As Shannon Haley became available, Timothy also spoke with Shannon Haley, the School Social Worker. Shannon was described to be the best person to speak with Timothy as she meets with Timothy on a regular basis and has established the most rapport with him. As Timothy spoke with Shannon, Timothy disclosed what was reported in the child abuse referral. Timothy advised his injuries occurred when he was slapped, and/or struck, by his dad (Jack James Hebb). Timothy advised he was struck on multiple occasions by Jack Hebb. As Shannon Haley is aware of Timothys history and aware of the alleged acts committed by the family member(s), Shannon became concerned ans suspected Timothy had been abused. Shannon believed Timothys explanation to be truthful and consistent with his injuries. After the referral was made, John Sherbin and I later responded to the school. Upon speaking with Timothy for the first time, Timothys explanation about being hit by his dad, and his dad causing the injuries to his ears, head, and face, remained the same. Later, when Timothy made a disclosure to Dr. Sisler, who medically evaluated Timothy, his explanation consistently remained the same.    In speaking with John Sherbin, the Garrett County Department of Human Services Worker, it was found there was a history of allegations of abuse and/or neglect with the Hebb family. John Sherbin advised he has had past investigative conversations with Jack Hebb, where Jack explained to John Sherbin he would have to physically grab the head of Timothy Smith with both of his hands and scream into his face. John advised Jack explained to him this physical means was the only way Jack felt to make Timothy conform and make Timothy act the way Jack wanted him to act. These actions by Jack Hebb were cautioned in the past and were attempted to be resolved by the Department of Human Services in past investigations.    The Garrett County States Attorney, Christian Mash, was informed of the progress of the investigation at a CAC meeting on 2/28/2023.    On 3/7/2023, a CINA (Child in Need of Assistance) Hearing was continued at the Garrett County Circuit Courthouse. The Garrett County Department of Human Services maintains custody of Timothy Smith. Timothy Smiths biological mother, Jessica Ann Smith, is attempting to establish reunification, through the Garrett County Department of Human Services. The Garrett County Department of Human Services (John Sherbin) has made an indicated finding of physical child abuse against Jack James Hebb II.    On 2/28/2023, an Application for Statement of Charges was filed against the defendant, Jack James Hebb II. A warrant was requested. A warrant was issued by the District Court Commissioner for the following criminal charges:       1 0173 - CR 3-601(d) - Child Abuse, Second Degree, Custodial      1 3802 - CR 3-601(d) - Child Abuse, Second Degree, House      1 1614 - CR 3-602.1 (b) - Neglect of a Minor      1 1415 - CR 3-203 - Second Degree Assault    On 03/15/2023, Jack James Hebb was arrested and transported to the MSP-McHenry Barrack for processing. Hebb was not interested in speaking with me about the allegations as he stated he has acquired an attorney. A DNA sample was completed in regard to the qualifying criminal charge. After processing, Hebb was transported to the Garrett County Commissioners Office where a bond hearing was completed. Hebb was held at the Garrett County Jail pending the results of a bail review hearing the following day.Tracking number 231001024295.    On 3/21/2023, I was in conversation with the Garrett County States Attorneys Office in regard to the final case specifics and the findings involving the remaining suspect, Tammy Hebb. I explained it had been expressed by Timothy Smith that his other custodial family member(Tammy Hebb) was present during the occasion(s) Timothy had been allegedly abused by Jack Hebb. As their residence remains a primary full time residence for both parents, it was reasonably believed Tammy Hebb was aware of the abuse her husband was causing to Timothy and she failed to provide the proper care and attention to Timothy to prevent any injuries. This action placed Timothys health and welfare in harm and/or in a substantial risk of harm as Timothy was believed to be abused. As Timothy Smith was evaluated by Dr. Sisler, he was found to exhibit injuries which appeared non-accidental and suspected of child abuse. In addition, he was also shown to have poor hygiene involving his teeth and showed low percentiles in height, weight, and body mass index. The following charges were recommended to be filed against Tammy Hebb:       1 1614 - CR 3-602.1(b) - Neglect of a Minor      2_0238 - CJ 3-8A-30 - Contributing to the Circumstances of a Child    All events did occur in Garrett County, MD.    Case remains open pending an additional arrest.       </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>    On approximately 4/10/2023, I learned of a letter which was written by the victim, Timothy Smith. The letter was discovered by Morgan Cussins, a Foster Care Worker at the Department of Human Services. A copy of the letter was placed in the case file. The letter was reportedly written by Timothy Smith to his stepmother, Tammy Hebb. Timothy had expressed in the letter and was asking why Tammy had hit him. It was believed the issue was required to be addressed with the victim, Timothy Smith. A forensic interview was recommended to be completed with Timothy.     On 4/27/2023, a forensic interview was completed at the Child Advocacy Center in Oakland, MD. The child, Timothy Smith, was interviewed in regard to allegations concerning his stepmother, Tammy Hebb. The forensic interview was recorded and will be available for review. The forensic interviewer assigned was Amanda Richardson. The Assistant States Attorney, Mary Burnell, was present at the interview site. As the forensic interview was completed, Timothy advised his stepmother, Tammy Hebb, struck and grabbed Timothys head in the same manner as Jack Hebb. For a complete explanation of the interview, see the recorded version.     As the Assistant States Attorney was present and upon seeing the totality of the case, she advised she would apply for charges against Tammy Hebb for Child Abuse, Neglect of a Minor, and Contributing to the Circumstances of a Child.     All events did occur in Garrett County, MD.     Case remains open.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On 06/30/2023 at approximately 1510 hours, I responded to 1258 Mellott Road, Oakland, Garrett County, MD 21550 for a warrant service of Hebb.    Upon arrival, I made contact with Tammy Hebb at the residence. At approximately 1639 hours I placed Tammy Hebb under arrest, without issue, and placed her in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. I transported Tammy Hebb to the Maryland State Police McHenry Barrack for processing.    At approximately 1737 hours, I transported Tammy Hebb to the Garrett County District Court Commissioners Office located at 233 East Alder Street, Oakland, Garrett County, MD 21550 for a bond review. At the conclusion of the bond review, the district court commissioner determined Tammy Hebb was held without bond. At approximately 1914 hours I transported Tammy Hebb to the Garrett County Detention Center located at 311 East Alder Street # 1502, Oakland, Garrett County, MD 21550, where I released her into their custody.    Tammy Hebb made no statements regarding the case.    Case closed by arrest.    All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
