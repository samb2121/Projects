Plank advised it happened a couple of days ago. Plank advised she is taking her medication but thinks it is not working.  Scene Processing None  Neighborhood Check None   Narrative      On 04/24/2023 at approximately 1341 hours, I responded to4614 Ridge Road, Mount Airy, MD 21771 for the report of a subject that called 911 and made suicidal statements. I was advised while en route to the address that the caller was April. Based on prior incidents I am familiar with April Plank. Plank has an extensive history of suicidal thoughts and self harm. Upon arrival, I made contact with the victim April Plank. When Plank came to the door I noticed a red abrasion on her right cheek. I asked Plank what happened to her face she stated I dont remember, All I remember is hitting my face. I repeated to her that you hit you face, and she stated not me someone else. When asked who she stated I dont remember. When asked when she got the mark on her face she stated she guesses the day before yesterday. Plank sat on the back porch and advised she was feeling out of it. Plank advised she needed her medications checked. Planked stated that she was having thoughts to harm herself. Plank advised she wanted to cut herself. Plank had a red mark on the left side of her face. Plank advised it happened a couple of days ago. Plank advised she is taking her medication but thinks it is not working.  Plank had mark on the side of her face that she was scratching. When asked about it, she said it was from a couple of days ago. Winfield Fire Department personnel gave Plank a band-aid. Plank initially advised the mark was from a couple of days ago. Plank then advised she did not know what the mark was from. Plank then advised the mark was from burning her self with the coffee pot. Plank later advised the mark was from the other week.      At approximately 1407 hours, Plank was detained for an Emergency Petition. I transported Plank to Carroll Hospital Center where she was released to hospital staff at approximately 1525 hours. While waiting for a room at hospital Plank took off the band-aid and scratched the mark on her face until it started to bleed. I filled out all pertinent emergency petition paperwork, which was forwarded to hospital staff as well.    Due to the above stated facts, I request this case closed.    All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.   </NarrativeText>
