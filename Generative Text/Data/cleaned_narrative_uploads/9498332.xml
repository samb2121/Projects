         <NarrativeText>The DUI Number for the following incident is 23-055  This incident was recorded on mobile video.   Violation:    On 05/12/2023 at approximately 2120 hours, I was on routine patrol operating MSP unmarked vehicle Tac-18. At that time, I was dispatched to respond to a motor vehicle collision that occurred in the area of 13620 Cearfoss Pike, Hagerstown, MD 21740. Upon my arrival, I identified the at fault vehicle to be a 1998 Lexus ES300 bearing VA registration TVB6966. The other vehicle involved was identified as a 2021 Toyota Rav4 bearing MD registration 3ER2868.     Through my investigation it was revealed that both vehicles had been traveling eastbound on RT 58 (Cearfoss Pike). The Toyota Rav 4 was located in front of the Lexus ES300. The Lexus struck the rear of the Toyota Rav 4 at a high rate of speed. The driver of the at fault vehicle (Lexus) was identified as the defendant in this case as Christopher Austin Silva (W/M, D.O.B. 10/04/1999).    Upon making contact with the defendant, I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath, his eyes appeared bloodshot and glassy and his speech was slurred. He acted emotional and apologetic and stated several times that he had been drinking alcohol. When I asked the defendant what happened he stated I was coming down a little fast. I really didnt notice anyone in front of me. Im not going to lie Ive been drinking; I really have. I wouldnt say too much but Im sure the breathalyzer would say more than the legal limit. I asked the defendant how much he had to drink and he stated that he had consumed a 6 pack of Bud Light Platinum. Based on my observations the defendant was asked to exit the vehicle in order to perform SFSTs.   STANDARD FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS:    I am trained and certified to perform Standardized Field Sobriety tests (SFTSs) by the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I have also attended and completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training. The defendant advised that he was not currently taking any prescription medications. He stated that he did not have any injuries or medical conditions that would prevent him from performing field sobriety tests. Field Sobriety was performed on the shoulder of RT 58. The surface was free from debris and was a level asphalt surface.  TEST #1 Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)    The defendant stated that he did not have any medical or physical problems that would prevent him from taking the test. He was not currently wearing glasses or contact lenses. The test was explained and the defendant stated that he understood the test instructions.He stated that he could see the stimulus and was able to track it with his eyes. He displayed equal pupil size and equal tracking in both eyes. He displayed lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  TOTAL CLUES: 6 out of 6  TEST #2: Walk and Turn    The defendant was placed in the instructional stage and the test was demonstrated and explained. The defendant was unable to maintain his balance throughout the instructional portion of the test. On the first set of 9 steps the defendant stepped off line and missed heel to toe on steps 1, 2 and 5. The defendant did not perform the turn as demonstrated. On the second set of nine steps the defendant stepped off line and missed heel to toe on steps 1, 4 and 7.  TOTAL CLUES: 4 out of 8.  TEST #3 One-leg stand    The defendant was offered to take the one leg stand test and the test was demonstrated and explained. The defendant raised his right foot and attempted to take the test. The defendant swayed on count 18.   TOTAL CLUES: 1 out of 4    The defendant was also offered a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) via PBT Serial Number 70017334 in order to gauge the defendants level of intoxication. The defendant agreed to take the test with a result of .16.  ACTION TAKEN:    The defendant was placed under arrest at 2147 hours on 5/12/2023 and was transported to the Maryland State Police Hagerstown Barrack for processing. The defendant was advised of his rights via MVA DR15 at 2215 hours and agreed to submit to the breath test. At 2227 hours, the defendant was found to have .13 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. The defendant was provided with the appropriate paperwork and released to the custody of a sober party.     All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland.    Case Status: Based on the above stated facts, I respectfully request this case be closed by arrest.     </NarrativeText>
