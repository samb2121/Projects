         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS: MSP Form 246 VICTIM: Brothers, Teresa Lynn 519 Dryer Ave, Cumberland Maryland 21502 (240) 522-2796 SUSPECT: Hendershot, James W 11400 Stone Mountain Road SE (240) 580-0894 WITNESS: Jenkins, Kelsey Dawn 123 S St, Cumberland Maryland 21502 (240) 580-0893 NARRATIVE:  On Sunday, April 23rd at approximately 1142 hours the MSP Cumberland Barrack received a call for a dispute at 11400 Stone Mountain Road SE. The caller advised her name was Teresa Brothers and advised that Kelsey Jenkins as well as James Hendershot were all at the location. Brothers also advised that she had a protection order out against Hendershot and that Hendershot has a protection order out on Jenkins.   When I arrived at the location I observed multiple people standing by a car in the driveway, one male sitting in a Jeep in the driveway, and a female on the porch of the house. TFC Michael and I made contact with the complainant who we identified as Teresa Lynn Brothers, DOB: 06/19/1971. While speaking with Brothers she advised that her son who is James William Hendershot, DOB: 02/16/1992 and his ex-girlfriend Kelsey Dawn Jenkins, DOB: 05/25/1994 were at the residence. Brothers advised that Jenkins was moving because she and Hendershot were being evicted from the residence. Brothers advised that she came to the residence today to help Jenkins move her and the kids belongings to her new residence. Brothers advised that when she arrived Hendershot was at the address and that he wasnt supposed to be at the address. Brothers then advised that she had a protection order out on Hendershot and that Hendershot has a protection order on Jenkins. TFC Michael continued to speak with Brothers and I made contact with Hendershot. Hendershot then advised he came over to the residence at around 2000 hours and took the kids out for food. He advised that he then brought the kids back to the residence. Hendershot told me that Jenkins said he could stay the night due to him having nowhere else to go. Hendershot said that Jenkins and he had got into an argument last night, but everything was worked out. He then advised they went to bed and everything was ok until his mom (Brothers) pulled into the driveway today. Hendershot said that he got mad because Jenkins made a comment about him and his little sister when they were younger as well as stuff with his father. I then spoke with Brothers again, and she advised that she didnt know Hendershot was at the address. She advised that she last spoke with Hendershot at around 940 hours because he called. Brothers said Hendershot called and when she answered he was being loud on the phone so she hung up. Brothers also advised that she last spoke with Jenkins around 2200 hours and Jenkins told her that kids are here.  After speaking with Brothers I made contact with Jenkins. Jenkins advised me that Hendershot had come to the address to pick up the kids the night prior. Jenkins then advised she told Hendershot to leave, but he just sat down and refused to leave. Jenkins advised that the incident was all just verbal but Hendershot did throw a water bottle down the hallway of the residence. Jenkins also advised that Hendershot has been messaging her constantly since the protective order had been in effect. Jenkins advised that she only replies when Hendershot asked about their kids and to tell him to stop messaging and calling. Jenkins then showed me the messages and calls from Hendershot on her cellphone.       While on scene a Domestic Violence Supplemental Report was completed for Jenkins and Hendershot. Due to the circumstances at the location no charges will be filled for any of the parties. Jenkins was advised to not make any more contact with Hendershot and Hendershot was told to stop contacting Jenkins. Hendershot was also advised not to contact Brothers as well. All events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.  Case Status: Closed. </NarrativeText>
