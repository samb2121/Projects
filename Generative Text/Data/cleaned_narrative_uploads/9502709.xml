         <NarrativeText>This incident was recorded by BWC # 7429.  Scene Processing :There is no substantial evidence or leads for the money taken.  Narrative:  On 2/28/23 at approximately 1015 hours two subjects, identified through their Maryland Drivers Licenses as,Richardson, Ray Steven DOB 07/21/1953 and his wife,Richardson, Regina Naomi DOB 01/05/1954 had entered the barrack to file a police report regarding theft of money.  I made contact with them in the lobby and Mr. Richardson explained that on 02/27/23 at approximately 1000 hours a virus had affected his personal desktop at his residence. After the virus had blocked his ability to use his computer, he was contacted on his cell phone from someone claiming to be Mark Jones with Wells Fargo Security support. The number they had kept changing throughout the day whenever they received a call and sometimes the caller ID would be unknown. He could not provide me with a specific number to call. Jones had claimed that due to the virus on his computer his Wells Fargo account was in jeopardy and would have 40,000 withdrawn from it within the next 3 days if Mr. Richardson did not follow his instructions. Jones claimed the first step to resolve this issue was to withdraw the money from his account and get 40,000 cash. Jones had also stated that due to this being an ongoing investigation Mr. Richardson should refrain from talking about this incident to anyone at his Wells Fargo bank.  On 2/27/23 at approximately 1616 hours Mr. Richardson went to the Wells Fargo near his residence located at 5801 Silver Hill RD, District Heights, MD 20747 and attempted to withdraw 40,000 in cash from his account. The clerk that assisted him had claimed that he was not able to withdraw such a large amount of cash on such short notice and allowed Mr. Richardson to withdraw 10,000 cash from his account. Mr. Richardson did not mention Mark Jones with Wells Fargo Security support while visiting his bank. Immediately after leaving Wells Fargo, Mr. Richardson had met his wife at the Plaza Liquor store located at 6439 Marlboro Pike, District Heights MD 20747. While on the phone with Jones, Mr. Richardson followed his instructions to use an ATM located in the store that would transfer his 10,000 cash into Bitcoin.  Upon submitting his 10,000 cash into Bitcoin he received a receipt from the ATM with no specific details other than the amount of money and time of 1640 hours that it was submitted into the ATM. Mr. Richardson had no account information regarding the transfer. Jones had advised Mr. Richardson to try and submit another 10,000 the following day to ensure his account would not be in jeopardy with the virus.The following day Mr. Richardson and his wife were skeptical of Jones and had realized that his money was stolen from his account and immediately went to the MSP Forestville Barrack with his wife to report the incident. Mr. Richardson was made aware after the deposit into the bitcoin ATM, based on a brief conversation he had with the actual Wells Fargo customer service hotline at the barrack, that he was scammed and willingly withdrew and gave away his money.  Mr. Richardson was given a case number and a victims brochure pamphlet. He was also advised to not have further contact with the fake Wells Fargo Support alias Mark Jones.  On 3/7/2023 at 2200 hours contact was made with Wells Fargo Customer Support hotline operator Victoria and was advised that they dont have any known information on a Mark Jones and that they would not advise any customer to withdraw money and submit it into a bitcoin ATM; That doing so would be them willingly withdrawing and handling their money how they see fit.  Due to lack of leads regarding this incident I am asking for it to be closed at this time.</NarrativeText>
