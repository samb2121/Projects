         <NarrativeText>On Wednesday, June 07, 2023, at approximately 0720 hours, Detective Navarro #2152 of the Prince Georges County Police Narcotics Enforcement Division was conducting proactive drug trafficking interdiction efforts at the United Parcel Service Burtonsville Facility located at 14841 Sweitzer Lane, Laurel, Prince Georges County, Maryland 20707. During these efforts, Detective Navarro observed a brown cardboard box that displayed numerous indicators that it contained controlled dangerous substances (CDS) and it was removed from the delivery stream for further investigation.  The shipment displayed the following information (written below as written on the label): 1Z 5XR 373 01 0655 0071. [This tracking number is a unique tracking number assigned only to this parcel.] FROM: SUGARLAND 6264478260 411 E HUNTINGTON DR SUITE 107 ARCADIA CA 91006  SHIP TO: ANTHONY CHARLES LANGFORD 5623 MILLWHEEL PL COLUMBIA MD 21045-2563 Detective Navarro noted that the shipment was in a brown cardboard box and displayedcharacteristics of a drug laden parcel. Further, by querying the United Parcel Service trackingnumber, your affiant discovered that the parcel was sent from California, Arcadia; a city andstate known to Detective Navarro to be a possible source state for controlled dangeroussubstances.  Based on a totality of the circumstances, Detective Navarro, along with his canine partnerMolly conducted a canine drug scan on the parcel with tracking number 1Z 5XR 373 01 0655 0071. The drug scan was conducted on the target parcel along with other non-targeted parcels.Detective Navarros canine partner Molly gave an alert followed by an indication for theodor of controlled dangerous substances on the target parcel bearing United Parcel Servicetracking number1Z 5XR 373 01 0655 0071 by passive response of sitting and staring.  Drug detector canine Molly is trained to detect the odor of controlled dangerous substances.These substances include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy andmethamphetamine. Upon detection of the odor of any of these (six) controlled dangerous substances, the canines behavior will change. The canine is trained to come to a final responseof sitting and or starring at the source of the odor. This is called a passive final response. Thisresponse may also indicate items recently contaminated with, or associated with, the odor of oneor more of the controlled dangerous substances.  Detective Navarro and Molly have completed a 400-hour drug detection canine course withthe Prince Georges County Police Department and Molly is certified in the detection of theodors of Marijuana, Cocaine, Heroin, Methamphetamine and Ecstasy through theNorth American Police Working Dog Association. Additionally, the Prince Georges CountyPolice Department also requires all canine handlers to complete to a minimum of 8 hours ofmaintenance training per month.  After this canine drug scan, Detective Navarro seized this parcel bearing tracking number 1Z 5XR 373 01 0655 0071 from the aforementioned United Parcel Service facility in PrinceGeorges County, Maryland. He then contacted investigators at the Metropolitan Area Drug TaskForce and this writer, Trooper First Class Moreno #5652, also assigned to the MetropolitanArea Drug Task Force. Your affiant recovered the parcel at approximately 0855 hours andsecured it at the MADTF office located at CED Headquarters Howard County, Maryland where it wasstored for safe keeping.  A search and seizure warrant was authored and granted, by the honorable judge Powell.  Upon execution of the search warrant revealed a cardboard tubing with eleven heat sealed baggies of Marijuana inside, with an approximate weight of 6100 grams.   At approximately 1400 hours, investigators conducted surveillance at the target home address and made contact with Anthony Charles Langford, with a DOB of 6/22/2010 who was listed as one of the tenants that resided at the residence. A discussion with Mr. Langford resulted in negative results, as he advised us that he smokes marijuana, but was not expecting a parcel or anyone that was expecting a shipment.  Secondary processing of the above listed evidence was conducted and the evidence was packaged and sealed under Maryland State Property # P344587 and weight, including all packaging at 8700 grams, verified by Cpl. Deibel. The parcel of marijuana was stored in the Maryland state Police CED Headquarters Evidence Locker and was seized for destruction.
