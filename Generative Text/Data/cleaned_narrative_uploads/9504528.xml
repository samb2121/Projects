         <NarrativeText>*Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack* Vehicle: Blue Unmarked Ford Explorer B-69 Body Camera Equipped and Functioning: No In-car Camera Equipped and Functioning: No  ATTACHMENTS: None  COMPLAINANT: RONOLDA JOSEPH  MISSING: ROBERT JOSEPH  SCENE PROCESSING: N/A  NARRATIVE: On 9/16/23, at approximately 1048 hours, TFC Devin was dispatched to 225 Braeburn Dr, in reference to a missing person. TFC Devin made contact with RONALDO JOSEPH. RONALDA stated that she had not spoke to her husband ROBERT JOSEPH since 9/15/23, at approximately 1500 hours. While investigating this report, TFC Devin responded to an unrelated incident that required his attention for the remainder of his shift.  At approximately 1430 hours, I, TFC Meyers, was contacted by the Frederick barrack in order to assist on this missing persons report. I then made contact with the complainant myself, via phone. I attempted to contact ROBERTSS phone multiple times, however each time it went to voicemail. It was around this time I learned that dispatch had already entered ROBERT in as missing through NCIC.  At approximately 1752 hours, I was contacted by the Duty Officer SGT Cain who informed me that ROBERT had contacted the barrack and stated he was staying at 4 Commerce Center Dr Dover NJ.SGT Cain then made contact with local NJ pd to physically confirm that ROBERT was okay. At 1826 hours, Morris County NJ Sheriffs Office were able to make contact with ROBERT and later inform us that he was okay. After NJ made contact with us again, ROBERT was removed from NCIC as missing.  I then made contact with RONALDA again and informed her that ROBERT was okay and this was confirmed by police.  Report was made in Frederick County MD, missing person was located out of state in NJ by local PD.  I request this case be closed.</NarrativeText>
