         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING:  -Scene was conveyed for evidence of the crime. Scene was photographed and pictures were taken of damaged glass panels.  NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK: -ShopRite located at1321 Riverside Pkwy, Belcamp, MD 21017. Nothing was observed. Managers didnt have access to surveillance footage. - Riverside Pizzeria located at 1321 Riverside Pkwy, Belcamp, MD 21017. Nothing was observed. -Sunoco located at 1319 Riverside Pkwy, Belcamp, MD 21017. Still shots obtained of truck near the side of Mavis tire shop. Appeared to look like a Home Depot rental truck.  NARRATIVE:  On October 27th 2023 at approximately 0735 hours, I Cpl. Turner #6761 of the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack was dispatched to Mavis Tires  Brakes located at 1321 Riverside Pkwy, Belcamp, MD 21017 for a burglary. Upon my arrival, I observed broken glass on the floor and four (4) broken window panels on the third from the left bay door of the building. The Mavis building was cleared and no potential suspects in the building. Upon obtaining surveillance footage of the burglary from Mavis and from the adjacent Sunoco gas station, I observed a Home Depot flatbed rental truck pull up to the side of Mavis at approximately 0717 hours on 10/27/23. The suspect, a white male exited the vehicle. He was wearing an orange reflective vest, dark blue or black pants and a matching color shirt, and a white baseball cap. The suspect attempted to pry or dislodge the glass panels in the bay doors. When he was unable to open the panels, he looked in the back of the truck and retrieved what appeared to be a hammer. The suspect then proceeded to break the 4 glass panels at the bottom of the door and climbed into the building. The suspect then proceeded to remove 20 tires from the store and load them into the flatbed of the Home Depot rental truck. The suspect then left the scene at approximately 0727 hours. The manager of the Mavis Tires  Brakes advised the tires had a value of approximately $3320. A witness called the Bel Air Barrack and advised he saw the suspect smash the glass panels of the store. He described the suspect as being approximately 56, medium build and clothing consistent with what the surveillance footage captured.  On October 29th 2023 at approximately 0720 hours, the Bel Air barrack put out a radio BOLO (Be on the lookout) for a burglary that occurred at Firestone Complete Auto Care located at 940 Beards Hill Rd, Aberdeen, MD 21001. They described the suspect vehicle as a Home Depot flatbed rental truck. As I was responding to the area Ofc. Tenny # 154 from the Aberdeen police department advised he stopped the vehicle in the rear parking lot of IHOP located at 980 Hospitality Way. I arrived on scene and observed a Home Depot rental truck displaying Maryland registration 9EK5924. Additionally, I observed a teal-colored tarp covering the bed of the truck. Beneath the tarp were numerous tires from the burglary that occurred at Firestone Complete Auto, as they were stamped with the words firestone. The suspect was identified as Neal Alan Truslow Jr (W/M DOB:7/9/80) of Havredegrace, MD. Truslow was approximately 58 and 175 lbs. The suspect was placed under arrest by Ofc Tenny. On the drivers seat of the Home Depot truck was a hammer with a red and black handle. The hammer was consistent with the hammer used in the burglary at Mavis tires. Due to following I believe Truslow also committed the Mavis burglary;  -occurring at similar times of the day 717 hours and 720 hours -the modus operandi being similar in relation to how the businesses were broken into -type of business targeted -possession of hammer/ burglary tool -type of items stolen -consistent physical description -operating Home Depot rental truck the same as the Mavis burglary,  I request this case remain open pending an application of chargers submission.</NarrativeText>
