         <NarrativeText>Attachments:  -Signed Search Warrant -MSP Form 98 -MSP Form 98A -MSP Form 67 (Chain of Custody)  Narrative:  This incident was captured on Body Worn Camera.  On 06/30/2023 Virginia State Police Troopers contacted MSP CED Central South Investigators and requested assistance with obtaining a DNA search warrant for one of their investigations. The suspect of their investigation who was identified as Jamar Ronnell Lancaster DOB 07/29/1980 was suspected to be the driver of a vehicle who caused the deaths of two individuals after fleeing from Virginia Troopers, traveling at 100 mph. He was subsequently charged with involuntary manslaughter in Virginia. Lancaster is currently being held at the Dorsey Run Correctional Institution in Jessup, Anne Arundel County, MD for unrelated crimes committed in Maryland. Virginia State Police Sergeant S. Gregory requested MSP obtain a search warrant for Lancasters DNA to compare with the drivers side airbag of the vehicle in the collision.  On 7/10/23 I authored a search warrant for the DNA which was reviewed and signed by Anne Arundel County District Court Judge Robinson.  I responded to the facility with Sergeant Gregory on 07/13/23 and collected two buccal swabs from Lancaster. The MSP form 67 was completed, and the swabs were released to Virginia State Police Sergeant Gregory. The Search Warrant Return (MSP Form 98) and Inventory (MSP Form 98A) were completed and copies were provided to the suspect.  The Return and Inventory were sent to Judge Robinson on 07/13/23 and are attached to this report.  Case closed </NarrativeText>
