         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS: Receipts of Charges provided by the complainant  AXON CAMERA: https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=e3abe18c3b3d4fbd86dcf7dd7a75dab4partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  NEIGHBORHOOD CHECKS: No neighborhood checks were completed due to the nature of this incident.  NARRATIVE:    On September 12, 2023, at approximately 1426 hours I, Trooper First Class Graves #7199, was dispatched to 1010 N Salisbury Boulevard, Salisbury Maryland 21801 for a reported identity theft. Upon my arrival to the scene I would make contact with the complainant, identified as Sharmare Juanita Burrell (1/F BOB:03/20/1979) who would inform myself the address of where the incident had occurred is 605 Rose Street, Salisbury Maryland 21801. Burell would inform myself that she believed she was a victim of identity theft and multiple credit cards and other accounts had been compromised.  Burell would continue to state at approximately 0900 hours she would observe an email from Gusto, a financial payroll system, and would also receive a phone call asking her about a $500 purchase that had been made from her account. Burell would inform the company that the purchase was in fact fictitious to which they would direct her through their fraud department to take the appropriate steps in closing her account.  At approximately 1245 hours Burrell received an email from her Target account notifying her of 2 online orders being delivered to 500 E 13th Street Silver City New Mexico-name on order listed as Raul Mendez and 1748 Gotham Street Chula Vista California-name on order listed as Burells. The total of both Target online orders would add up to be approximately $55.29. Burrell would cancel both of the orders and contact Targetsfraud department to take the appropriate steps in closing her account.  At approximately 1500 hours Burrell would be notified by her Blaze Credit Card (Account Number: 51821300334656530) that there was a $455.00 charge for an electronic device. Burrell would contact Blaze Credit Card and inform them the purchase was in fact fictitious to which they would direct her through their fraud department to take the appropriate steps in closing her account.  Shortly after this incident Burrell would be informed by Affirm, a financial loan company, via phone call that an iPhone 13 Pro Max Gold 128 GB phone had been purchased on her account totaling in the amount of $855.99. Burrell would also be informed by Affirm that a charge of $1,823.57 had been made through Spirit Vacations website. Burrell would inform the company that the purchase was in fact fictitious to which they would direct her through their fraud department to take the appropriate steps in closing her account.  Burrell would provide a copy of the Spirit Vacation Booking of the Hardrock Hotel and Casino in Punta Cana booked for September 14th through the 18th and a compact car rental from September 14th to the 16th (Confirmation Numbers- 650306902  38330352US4. Trip Number- 39447407516).  I would later contact Spirit Company in attempt to gather further information of the trip that had been booked fraudulently, with negative results. Burrell would also state that she believed her email, Sharmareburrell@outlook.com to have also been tampered with and was discovering emails that had been deleted that she had not deleted herself.  Burrell was given a case number andinformed to continue with the process of closing her accounts and continuing investigations with the fraud departments.  I request this case remain open pending further investigation.  All events occurred in Wicomico County Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 09/14/2023, at 0930 hours I responded to AVIS rental company5485 Airport Terminal Rd A, Salisbury, MD 21804 (Salisbury Airport) and made contact with the victim/complainant identified as Sharmane Burrell. Sharmane advised that the suspect identified as Veronica Perez Burrell was scheduled to pick up the rental car at AVIS rental company at 1000 hours on that date and time. Sharmane requested my presence in the event that Veronica showed up.  The employee at AVIS rental company was contacted and advised to contact the Barracks if the Veronica subject showed up, they advised they could contact us but they would not be able to point the subject out due to privacy constraints.  I stayed at the airport with Sharmane from 0930 until 1200 hours on 09/14/2023 and did not observe anyone show up trying to use Sharmanes credentials.  According to documentation that Sharmane provided, the Veronica subject was also scheduled to check into a hotel in Punta Cana that same date.  Sharmane advised she did not know anyone named Veronica Perez Burrell nor did she give anyone permission to use her credentials.  All events occurred in Wicomico County MD.</NarrativeText>
