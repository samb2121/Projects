Case# 23-MSP-021992 Defendant: Victor Weinberg JR Date of Birth: 06/26/1985  Date of Arrest: 06/19/2023 Time of Arrest: 1253hours DUI #: 23-103 Citation #: 4TS0XD0 Breath Result: .00   Certificates and Training *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  *Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) Certified  *Certified Emergency Medical Technician by the Maryland Institute of Emergency Medical Services Systems  *Certified RADAR/LIDAR operator by the Maryland State Police  *Certified License Plate Reader (LPR) operator by the Maryland State Police  *Apprehended over 125 impaired drivers while working as a Maryland State Trooper  *2023 Distinguished graduate of the University of Maryland DUI Institute  Vehicle In Motion (Phase 1)  On June 19th, 2023 at approximately 1237 hours I, Trooper Sigman #7376, currently assigned to the Golden Ring Barrack, was on routine patrol in Carroll County in the area of Old Washington Road prior to Nicodemus Road when I observed a black Ford F-150 bearing Maryland registration of 4FJ4953 traveling in lane 1. I observed that the F-150 was following within one car length of the vehicle in front of it. I observed that the F-150 would gradually get closer to the other vehicle then suddenly brake to create distance then slowly get closer again. I then observed the F-150 fail to maintain a single lane of travel and drift off of the roadway right and proceed to drive half in lane 1 and half on the right shoulder with both passenger tires across the solid white line. The F-150 continued to drive half off of the roadway. I then ran the registration through METERS/MVA. MVA showed the registration to be expired from 06/01/2023. I then activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on the black Ford F-150 bearing Maryland registration of 4FJ4953. The F-150 did not react to my lights and sirens and continued to drive as if I was not behind him. The F-150 then approached the stop sign at Nicodemus Road. The F-150 then noticed my presence, made a right turn onto Nicodemus, then stopped in the middle of lane 1. I then got on my PA speaker and requested the driver to pull forward as I was stuck in the middle of the intersection behind him. The F-150 did not react.  Personal Contact (Phase 2)  I then made a drivers side approach of the black Ford F-150 bearing Maryland registration of 4FJ4953. I then identified myself, the reason for the stop, and requested the drivers license. The driver displayed pinpoint pupils and slow uncoordinated movements. The driver then advised me that he had been arrested for a drug DUI several days earlier and had his license confiscated. The driver then handed me a DR15A which identified him as Victor Weinberg Jr. (06/26/1985). Weinbergs identity was confirmed by his MVA photograph. Weinberg advised that he was driving from his house to a job site in Gaithersburg. I then asked Weinberg when he had last used a controlled dangerous substance. Weinberg stated that he had used heroin or fentanyl at approximately 0730 today. Weinberg stated that he takes heroin twice a day intravenously. Weinberg stated that this was what he was arrested for with his previous DUI. I then asked Weinberg to exit and walk to the front of his vehicle. Upon stepping out I observed that Weinberg displayed gait ataxia and swayed heavily from side to side. Weinberg then asked if he could switch shoes and wear his tennis shoes as he was more stable while wearing them. Weinberg was then provided with his tennis shoes. While changing shoes Weinberg almost fell over. I observed numerous track marks on both arms. Weinberg states he shoots up wherever he can find a vein. I then asked Weinberg if he would submit to standardized field sobriety testing. Weinberg agreed.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3)  The evaluation was performed in front of Weinbergs vehicle. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 80 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of normal daylight. My vehicles front facing emergency lights were deactivated for the duration of the field sobriety tests. Weinberg appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries and or defects.  I asked Weinberg the following questions:  Injuries- previous leg and back issues Medical conditions- none Medications- none Glasses or contacts- none Alcoholic beverages- denied Controlled dangerous substance- heroin/fentanyl at approximately 0730    Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (0/6)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The test was explained. I then began the test. I did not observe any resting nystagmus. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit - not present Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - not present Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - not present *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus - not present  I observed that Weinbergs eyes were pinpoint.     Walk and Turn (6/8 clues observed)  Prior to Weinberg performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. I asked Weinberg if he had any questions. Weinberg stated that he understood the test.    Instructional Stage: Steps out of starting position to prevent falling over twice   Walking Stage (1st Nine):  Steps off line Misses heel to toe Raises arms for balance    Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  Steps off line Misses heel to toe Raises arms for balance Takes 10 steps      Turn: Incorrect, moves counterclockwise in one large jerky movement almost falling over  One Leg Stand (4/4)  Prior to Weinberg performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Weinberg advised that he understood the test.  Instructional Stage: Sways from side to side     Balance and Count Stage  Seconds 0-10: Sways from side to side Puts foot down Hops Raises arms for balance      Seconds 11-20: Sways from side to side Puts foot down Hops Raises arms for balance      Seconds 21-30: Sways from side to side Puts foot down Hops Raises arms for balance  Modified Romberg Balance Test  I instructed Weinberg to stand with his feet together and arms by his side. Weinberg was instructed to close his eyes and estimate the passage of thirty seconds. Weinberg was instructed to open his eyes and say done when thirty seconds had passed. Weinberg stated that he understood the test.  Weinberg estimated thirty seconds had passed in 40 seconds    I instructed Weinberg to stand with his feet together and arms by his side. I instructed Weinberg to extend the index finger of both hands while down at his side. I advised that when I say right he was to lift his right index finger, touch the tip of his nose, then put it back down at his side. Weinberg was instructed to do the same with his left index finger when I said Left.. Weinberg stated that he understood the test.  Left- misses nose Right- Left- Right- Right- misses nose Left-   Arrest  Based on the following, I had probable cause to believe Weinberg was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance:  *Unable to maintain a single lane of travel *Following other vehicle within one car length *Slow to react to emergency light and sirens *Pinpoint Pupils *Slow uncoordinated motor movements *Gait ataxia *Admission to taking Heroin prior to driving *Poor SFST     At this time Weinberg was placed under arrest for DUI. Weinberg was then handcuffed, searched, and placed in the front seat of R-24 and seat belted inside. Weinberg was then mirandized. Weinberg was then transported to the Westminster Barrack. Weinbergs vehicle was towed by Priority Towing  Once at the Westminster Barrack Weinberg was walked inside and placed in the intoximeter room. A physical copy of the DR15 was placed in front of him and the audio version was played aloud. At the conclusion of the audio Weinberg stated that he wished to take the intoximeter test. The time was 1335 hours.  20-Minute Observation Period:  Nothing observed during the observation period.     Intoximeter Result:  .00 at 1350 hours CPL Eyles 5445 was the intoximeter operator.  I then asked if Weinberg would submit to a DRE evaluation. Weinberg refused. I then contact DRE Eckhardt #6469. Eckhardt then asked Weinberg if he would take a blood test. Weinberg refused. The time was 1411 hours.  Weinberg was then issued the appropriate citations as well as a DR15A. Weinberg was then released to his mother in the front lobby lot of the Westminster Barrack.  All above events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Date and time of evaluation: 06/19/2023 1402 Hours MSP Case number: 23-MSP-021992 Other Agency Case number: N/A Rolling log number: 23-006-0090 Location of evaluation: Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack Suspect: Weinberg Jr., Victor Date of birth: 06/26/1985  1. Breath Alcohol Test The suspect submitted to a breath alcohol test with the arresting officer which resulted a 0.00 BrAC.  2. Interview of Arresting Officer On June 19, 2023, I (TFC Eckhardt #6469), was contacted by Tpr. Sigman #7376 of the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack. He stated that he had a subject at the Westminster Barrack who had submitted to the breath test and had a result inconsistent with his observations of impairment. I was in an off duty status and could have responded to the Barrack; however, Tpr. Sigman advised that he asked his subject if they would be willing to submit to a DRE evaluation and they refused.  I spoke with Tpr. Signman and asked what took place. He explained that his arrestee, Victor Weinberg, was driving his vehicle, a Ford F150, in front of him in Carroll County. He observed the Ford following the vehicle in front of it too closely. He observed the Ford get closer to the vehicle in front of it and then suddenly brake. He also observed the Ford failing to maintain its lane. A MVA check also revealed that the Fords registration was expired. He conducted a stop on the vehicle and identified the driver as Weinberg. While speaking with Weinberg he observed his pupils to be pinpoint and his speech to be slow and lethargic. He also observed Weinbergs motor skills to be slow and uncoordinated. After asking Weinberg out of the vehicle, he observed his balance to be poor. Weinberg did admit to narcotic use earlier in the day.  Based on his observations, Tpr. Sigman placed Weinberg through SFSTs. He observed HGN 0/6 clues, WAT 6/8 clues, and OLS 4/4 clues. Based on his observations, Tpr. Sigman placed Weinberg under arrest for driving impaired. While back at the Westminster Barrack, Weinberg agreed to the breath test, which had a result of 0.00 BrAC, a result inconsistent with the level of impairment observed by Tpr. Sigman.  3. Preliminary Evaluation  Due to Weinberg refusing to even speak with a DRE, I elected to not respond to the Barrack. Based on the detailed observations that Tpr. Sigman provided me, I developed enough reasonable suspicion to believe that Weinberg was under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance and to request a blood kit.  4.

Injection Site Examination     margin-left:8px"&gt;Not completed  10. Observations and Subject Statements     margin-left:8px"&gt;Not completed  11. Opinion of Evaluator  In my opinion as a certified Drug Recognition Expert, I have enough reasonable suspicion to believe that Victor Weinberg Jr., is under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance, impaired, and cannot operate a motor vehicle safely.  My opinion is based on the observations made by Tpr. Sigman  12. Toxicology Exam Tpr. Sigman advised Weinberg of my request for a blood kit and the MVA sanctions that would be imposed if he agreed or refused the test. Ultimately, Weinberg refused the blood test. I issued a DR23 to Tpr. Sigman for the DR-15A.  13. Miscellaneous N/A  </NarrativeText>
