         <NarrativeText>On October 16, 2023 I met with the victim Taylor Atkins (hereafter referred to as Taylor), and his mother, Lisa Atkins (hereafter referred to as Lisa) at their residence at 233 Wineland Way, Stevensville, MD, 21666. Taylor told me he met the suspect on a social media application known as Wizz. After speaking with the suspect they moved the conversation to text messages. Taylor said the suspect used the email account flexjanes183@gmail.com to message him. The suspect asked him to send nude images of himself, which he did, and then demanded he pay $100 or she would send the pictures to his friends. He said he went to the nearby Target and got gift cards to send. After he sent the gift cards the suspect attempted to get more money from him and he blocked the account. He said the suspect attempted to contact him with different accounts but he kept blocking them.  A safety talk was conducted with Taylor and Lisa and they were provided with additional information on safe internet usage.  At this time the case will be closed by a safety talk.  Case status: Closed.</NarrativeText>
