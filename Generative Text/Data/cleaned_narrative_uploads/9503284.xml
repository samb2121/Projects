         <NarrativeText>In car camera (N-12) fully operational. Body Worn Camera Fully Operational. TFC J. Quase #6306 was on scene. Officer Farias #2286 of the Montgomery County Police Department was on scene and was wearing a body worn camera.  Defendant: Minor Jose Moreira Hernandez Date of Birth: 05/20/1999 Date of Arrest: 02/03/2023 Time of Arrest: 1840 No License trough any state. DUI #: 23-030  Officers Training/Experience * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. *Repeat Offender*No  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   Not observed.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) On 02/03/2023 at approximately 1752 hours, I (TFC J. Reid #7215) responded to the area of Northbound I-270, in the area of West Montgomery Ave (MD 28) for the report of a disabled vehicle in the roadway. Upon my arrival, I located a red Toyota RAV4 in lane one, and a red pickup truck directly in front of it. TFC Quase arrived on scene to assist. I made contact with a Hispanic male who advised his friend was driving the vehicle and he was the front seat passenger. He advised they ran out of gas and his friend went to get a gas can. I looked inside of the RAV4 and observed an open Corona beer bottle in the cup holder in the center console. Due to a language barrier, a Spanish interpreter was requested to respond to the scene. While waiting for the Spanish interpreter to arrive on scene, an additional Hispanic male arrived on scene. TFC Quase handed me the keys to the Toyota RAV4 and advised they were in the additional Hispanic males pocket. While attempting to speak to both Hispanic Males, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from both individuals, observed them both to have bloodshot and watery eyes, and observed both of them to slur their speech. Officer J.A. Farias #2286 (a Spanish interpreter) of the Montgomery County Police Department arrived on scene to translate. The Hispanic male who had the keys to the Toyota RAV4 in his pocket verbally identified himself to Officer Farias as, Minor Jose Moreira Hernandez (H/M DOB: 05/20/1999). Officer Farias spoke to Hernandez who advised he was driving the vehicle and ran out of gas. Due to the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Hernandezs breath, his eyes being bloodshot and glassy, and him slurring his speech, Officer Farias asked Hernandez if he was willing to perform the standardized field sobriety tests, and he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The test and evaluation was performed in lane one of the local lanes on I-270. The roadway was level and free from any debris. The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. Prior to the test being conducted, Officer Farias properly explained how the test should be conducted. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus. The stimulus was held approximately 12 inches from Hernandezs eyes. I instructed Hernandez to follow and focus on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes and his eyes only, and to keep his head completely still. I asked Hernandez if he understood the test and the instructions, he stated Yes. Hernandezs pupils were equal in size with no resting nystagmus.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 degrees  Present in both eyes Vertical Nystagmus  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (1/8)  Officer Farias advised Hernandez the next test is the walk and turn test. Prior to Hernandez performing the test, Officer Farias explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted in Spanish. The solid yellow line next to the concrete traffic barrier was used for the test. Hernandez was asked if he understood the test and the instructions, and he stated, yes to Officer Farias. Instructional Stage: No clues observed. Walking  First 9 Steps: Missed heel to toe  Step 7 Walking  Second 9 Steps: No clues observed.  ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed) Prior to Hernandez performing the test, Officer Farias explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed in Spanish. Hernandez was asked if he understood the test and the instructions, and he stated, Yes.   Balance and Count Stage: No clues observed.  ARREST  Based on the following,Ihad reason to believe Hernandez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence: 1) Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. 2) Bloodshot and glassy eyes. 3) Admission to driving the vehicle. 4) Slurred speech. 5) An open Corona beer in the cup holder in the center console. While on scene, Hernandez agreed to submit to a preliminary roadside breath test with a result of .19 BrAC. Hernandez was placed under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence at approximately 1840 hours.   Hernandez was transported back to the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack for processing. While at the Rockville Barrack, I was able to positively identify Hernandez by a picture of his ID card from a different country. Hernandez was played the Spanish version of the DR-15 advice of rights audio from the MVAs website. I provided Hernandez a copy in Spanish to read over.Hernandez signed the DR-15 and agreed to submit to an intoximeter test at approximately 1917 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ***.21 BrAC***  Hernandez was charged with Driving Under the Influence. While processing Hernandez, I was advised by my supervisor that the vehicle Hernandez was driving was involved in a hit and run motor vehicle collision earlier in the day. The victim of the hit and run arrived at the Rockville Barrack to file a report. I was able to obtain video surveillance footage from the victims vehicle showing the same vehicle Hernandez was driving, striking the victims vehicle and then leaving the scene. An accident report was completed via Delta Plus.  All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
