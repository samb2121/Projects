         <NarrativeText>DUI ARREST Incident was audibly and visually captured on body worn camera.  Defendant: Adrian Willie Graham Date of Birth: 05/21/1979 Date of Arrest: October 20, 2023 Time of Arrest: 1911 hours VA License #: T60486086 DUI #: 23-563  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES  -Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Baltimore County Police Department, Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, December 2022. -Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.) Trained, November 2017. -Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) Training, July 2018. -University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Law Enforcement Studies DUI Institute, Distinct Graduate, June 2019.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On October 20, 2023, at approximately 1750 hours, I, Tpr. R. Stewart #7590 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack R responded to the area of the ramp from S/B Northwest Expressway (I-795) to the I/L Baltimore Beltway (I-695) for a report of a Motor Vehicle collision involving a red Honda.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  Upon my arrival, fire department personnel were on scene with lane 2 of the ramp block mid ramp at I-695. I was notified by fire department personnel there were two occupants in the vehicle and there were no injuries. I approached the occupants and began speaking with them as they were standing away from the vehicle and along the right-side concrete barrier. It was then determined that Adrian Willie Graham (B/M 5/21/79) was driving and John Edward Tydings Jr. (W/M 8/2/78) was the passenger based off of their statements and admissions.  Graham stated as he was driving he was clipped and when I asked where he began walking towards his vehicle. Graham pointed to a scuff mark on the rear driver side bumper indicating where his vehicle was struck by an unknown vehicle. As I continued to speak with Graham I detect him to have slow speech glassy eyes and to be unsteady on his feet, as well as an odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. Graham then entered his vehicle to retrieve the vehicle registration from the glove compartment. As I continued to communicate with Graham as he was seated in the vehicle I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the passengers compartment, as well as his breath and person.  I returned to my vehicle and began completing the required documentation for the crash and requested TFC Hill respond to my location as a second unit. I later made contact with Graham who was seated in the passenger seat of the vehicle and asked him to step out to talk to me and he complied. While speaking with Graham at the rear of his vehicle I asked How much did you drink today? and Graham paused, looked away from me and began shaking his head side to side, shrugging his shoulders and responded Not much. Graham continued and stated he only had a drink a beer, then stated he Smoked a little weed. He continued to state that he smoked while he was driving. I asked how long ago he drank his beer and Graham stated 4 hours ago and that he smoked about an hour ago.   As I awaited TFC Hills arrival, I returned to my car and continued working on the necessary paperwork. When TFC Hill arrived it had began to rain, and I retrieved my rain jacket and again began to speak with Graham. Graham then advised his last drink was a few hours ago and again stated it was just a Budweiser. I asked Graham to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to confirm that he was okay to drive and he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the shoulder of the ramp. The surface was wet due to rain recently beginning to fall, fairly level, and free from any obvious large debris. Lighting conditions consisted of (street lights, my flashlight, and the my vehicles headlights.) Graham appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Graham the following questions: Glasses or Contacts  He was wearing glasses. Stigmatism in right eye.  Medical Conditions / Injuries  Graham advised he had metal in his neck, a recent shoulder surgery, lower back surgery. Medications  Trazadone and Seroquel  Seroquel  50mg once a day in the morning.  Trazadone  Not taken yet today.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. Graham was instructed to look straight ahead, keep his head still, and follow the tip of the stimulus with his eyes only. Graham was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Graham pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation Present in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not Present in both eyes  Graham initially struggled to follow the directions given and would move his head side to side. The test and instructions were given and repeated two times until Graham was able to follow the instructions properly.   WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Graham was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Graham was then instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and remain in that position until told to begin, he advised he understood. After providing the instructions and demonstration, I asked Graham if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  Graham performed this test wearing black lace-up shoes.  Instructional Stage: -Failed to maintaining starting position.  Walking Stage (1st Nine) -18 steps  had to be instructed to stop and come back -Missed Heel to Toe on multiple steps -Stepped off line  Turn: Had to be instructed to stop and then pivoted on both feet to turn around, When doing so Graham almost fell to his right.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine) -20 steps, stopped when at the front of my vehicle. -Stopped after turn while attempting to maintain his balance. - Missed Heel to toe -Stepped off line  Graham conducted the test in a slow and methodical method. During the test Graham stated his equilibrium is not that well and he was doing the best he could.  ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Graham was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. I asked Graham if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.Graham stated he had no questions.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-5: Put Foot down  Seconds 5-30: Test was stopped due to Graham complaining of it hurting his back due to his medical injuries.  While on scene, I informed Graham of his Preliminary Breath Test Rights. Grahamwas offered a PBT, to which he consented. I administered the PBT, S/N#: 70017323, witha result of 0.145 BrAC.  ARREST  Based on the totality of circumstances, I had reason to believe Graham was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and cannabis:  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from vehicle/breath/person. -Slow methodical movements -Slow speech -Unsteady on his feet -Clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Testing: HGN (6/6), WAT (6/8), OLS (1/4). -Admitted to smoking weed while driving. -Driver admitting to consuming one beer. -PBT result of 0.145 BrAC  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Graham was driving under the influence of alcohol and cannabis and was unable to operate a vehicle safely.  At approximately 1911 hours, I placed Graham under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol and cannabis. I immediately notified the barrack, and searched his person for weapons and contraband, both with negative results.  Graham was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy. I transported Graham to the Golden Ring Barrack and while enroute I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person in my patrol vehicle.  Upon arrival at the Golden Ring Barrack Graham was advised of his Advice of Rights using the audio recording from the MVAs website. The recording was stopped after the first paragraph and I asked Graham if he could hear and understand the recording, he confirmed that he could and that he had already read through it.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD  I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Graham beginning with his arrest. I observed Graham from the time of arrest until the time he agreed to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. Cpl. Wilson of the Maryland State Police, a certified breath test operator administered the breath test. Graham had a result of 0.17 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 2016 hours.  I processed Graham and released him to a family member in the lobby of the Golden Ring Barrack.  The defendant was issued copies of the following documents: -Citations -DR-15 Advice of Rights. -DR-15a Order of Suspension. -MSP 033 Result of Test for Alcohol Concentration  All documents were forwarded to the Baltimore County, States Attorney Office.  The vehicle was towed from the scene.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
