         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS:   Digital Photographs - VeriPic   Chain of Custody - Laura Hyatt Interview   MVA Printouts  NARRATIVE:  On February 20, 2023 at approximately 1430 hours, I was contacted by Corporal Buck in reference to a residential fire at 541 Daisy Drive, Taneytown, Carroll County, MD. Corporal Buck was previously contacted by Deputy State Fire Marshal Quick who stated there was a single victim in the fire who was in cardiac arrest and currently being transported to Carroll Hospital. DSFM Quick advised it was not believed that the victim would survive due to injuries from the fire.  I responded to 541 Daisy Drive and met with DSFM Quick and DSFM Dell who were already on scene. I obtained a brief summary of their tasks completed prior to my arrival. DSFM Quick stated there were three occupants in the home at the time of the fire and multiple other family members who had since arrived at the scene. One occupant, Claudette Hyatt, was transported to the hospital. The two additional occupants were identified as Laura Hyatt (Daughter of Claudette) and Lauras daughter, Madysan Swartz. DSFM Quick advised the remaining occupants and residents were being transported to the Taneytown Police Department where interviews could be completed. At the time of my arrival, DSFM Dell was calling Carroll Hospital and ultimately determined that the victim was declared deceased. DSFM Quick advised the victim was Claudette Hyatt (DOB: 12-03-1954).  DSFM Quick showed me the location of the fire. The residence was a two-story, interior unit, town home. Upon entering the front door, a stairway going upstairs is in front of the entrance, a living room is to the front of the home to the right, and a kitchen was visible to the rear of the home behind the living room. DSFM took me to the second floor of the residence which had large amounts of fire damage. There was also a large amount of water and water damage to the upper and lower floors from the fire department response. DSFM Quick identified the likely starting point of the fire as being at the top of the stairs in front of a closet. There were three additional bedrooms upstairs. One to the front right of the home, and two to the rear. DSFM Quick identified the victim as being in the rear, right bedroom and found on the floor. It is likely that the fire would have been in a location that would block free passage to use the stairwell to escape to the first floor and exit the home.  DSFM Dell and I responded to the Taneytown Police Department to initiate victim interviews. While enroute to the Police Department, I contacted Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Forensic Investigator TIna Rosensteel. FI Rosensteel advised she was already en route to the hospital, and would meet me when I arrived. I advised I would complete victim interviews, and then be responding to the hospital.  Upon arrival at the Taneytown Police Department, multiple family members were waiting in the department conference room. Three occupants were identified as being in the home at the time of the fire: Claudette Hyatt (DOB: 12-03-1954) Laura Hyatt (DOB: 02-02-1985) Madysan Swartz (04-17-2019)  A recorded interview was completed with Laura Hyatt. Hyatt stated she is the home renter, and was downstairs vacuuming at the time of the fire. She stated her son, Ryder, was outside riding his bike, two additional daughters were at a sleepover, and her boyfriend was not home at the time of the fire.  Hyatt stated approximately 3-5 minutes prior to the fire, her three-year-old daughter Madysan came down from upstairs and immediately crawled under a table on the lower level. Hyatt described this as the childs normal action when she may have done something wrong, or was scared of getting in trouble. At the same time, Hyatt stated her mother, Claudette, was upstairs in bed taking a nap. After Madysan came downstairs, Hyatt saw a glow coming from upstairs and felt heat and determined there to be a fire. Hyatt took her daughter and exited the home. She also then opened the front door and called to the dog that ran out of the home. She did not see her mother exit the home.  When interviewed by DSFM Dell, Hyatt explained that there were multiple rags/towels at the top of the stairs in the dirty laundry that had been used to clean up recent messes of spilled nail polish remover, Linseed Oil, and rubbing alcohol. These chemicals were spilled by her daughter, Madyson during accidents. Hyatt could not identify an ignition source, but did acknowledge that multiple residents in the home smoke marijuana, and she recently bought lighters, but could not locate where they currently were. She denied any observed activity of Madysan playing with lighters or having an interest in fire. Hyatt did state approximately a few days ago, there was a small rag of Linseed Oil near her mothers room that caught on fire, but they could not determine how it was ignited. The rag was extinguished by her mother with water, and the fire department was not called. The upstairs smoke detector was recently disabled as a result of this incident. The downstairs smoke detector was previously disabled due to frequently activating when the family would cook in the kitchen.    The interview concluded, and the family remained at the Taneytown Police Department with assistance being provided by the Red Cross.  DSFM Dell and I responded to Carroll Hospital to meet with FI Rosenteel. The victims body was still in an emergency Department Room positioned supine on a bed. FI Rosensteel advised the body injuries were consistent with injury from a fire. OCME Case 23-02388 was assigned. I took photographs of the body and observed the victim to have large amounts of black soot around her mouth and nose. There were soft tissue burns visible to her extremities and face. An endotracheal tube was in place from prior EMS/Hospital treatment.  Due to the family previously expressing concerns that they did not get to say goodbye to their loved one, I made contact with FI Rosensteel and they were provided with the option to have visitation with their mother before being transported to OCME. Laura Hyatt and one of her older children arrived at the hospital and spoke with FI Rosensteel before seeing their family member.  FI Rosensteel advised the body would be transported by Heartfelt Mortuary to OCME, however they had a delayed response. Due to this, the body would be transported by the hospital staff to the morgue pending transport.  DSFM Dell and I cleared the hospital after the family left. This case remains open pending a final autopsy report. The Fire Investigation portion of this case will be handled by the Office of the State Fire Marshal. CED West will follow up with a final report for cause/manner of death and will provide the OSFM with the findings in the death investigation.  CASE OPEN</NarrativeText>
