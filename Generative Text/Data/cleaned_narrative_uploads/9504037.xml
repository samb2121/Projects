         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> On February 16, 2023, Master Trooper Jeffrey Claycomb #0604, received a Firearms Registration Unit (FRU) Disapproval for a follow-up investigation. The subject of the investigation known as Cameron Lee Decker, White/Male, w/ DOB: 09/10/1999 (23 yoa) is currently prohibited from the possession of firearms and ammunition in the state of Maryland due to having received a court disposition of Probation before Judgement in the District Court for Baltimore County on 04/13/2022 for the traffic violation of Attempt by Driver to Elude Police in Official Police Vehicle by Failing to Stop, Transportation Article 21-904.C1. Refer to Case#/Citation# 07B0TQL. Decker was given one (1) year of supervised probation under PP Agent Jessica Hueitt, Office 42-Dundalk. His scheduled expiration date is 04/13/2023. As part of the conditions of his probation, #4 indicates he is to Get Permission from the Court before Owning a Dangerous Weapon. Agent Hueitt was contacted, and she advised, there was no indication in Deckers file where he received any permission from the court to possess a weapon.   According to the Maryland Automated Firearms Services System (MAFSS), DECKER currently owns one (1) regulated firearm, which is listed to him in this system. This firearm has been identified as a:    margin-left:8px"&gt;Canik, Model METE SFT, 9mm caliber, semiautomatic pistol, bearing serial# 21CC11786, Confirmed Location: Unknown, Date of Transfer: 04/09/2022.   An initial investigation was conducted for the missing firearms through various firearm-related sources, which included: ATF eTrace, LInX, NCIC, and RAPID. These resources yielded negative results for the firearm(s) as having been reported lost, stolen, traced, pawned, or recovered by another agency.   On 02/22/2023 Sgt. David Feltman #0915 and I responded for a knock  talk investigation at Deckers home reported as 8311 Bufflehead Drive; Dundalk, Baltimore County, Maryland 21222. Upon knocking on the door, we were met by Mr. Navarro Humberto, the homeowner. We informed Mr. Humberto we were looking for Cameron Decker regarding his handgun. Mr. Humberto was aware of the gun in question and granted us access to the home. Mr. Humberto called for Cameron to come downstairs to speak with us. Mr. Decker came downstairs to meet us along with the gun, which was secured in the factory gun box. We explained the situation to him, and he voluntarily surrendered his firearm to us. Upon examination of the firearm, it was discovered the serial number on the firearm was an exact match to the entry in the MAFSS database.   Decker was provided with copies of the MSP Form 67 Chain of Custody Log, the MSP Form 78 Consent to Search  Seize, the MSP Form 203 Firearms Disposition Record.   The seized firearm was then transported to MSP/CED Headquarters where it was packaged and processed in accordance with MSP policy and procedures. The recovered firearm was recorded and logged into evidence storage under Property Held Record number P-337091.   As a result of the circumstances of this case, I request this case be closed Non-Criminal.  Case closed.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  On April 13, 2023, I (Sgt. D. Feltman, Maryland State Police, Criminal Enforcement Division, Firearms Enforcement Unit) was contacted by Cameron Decker via telephone (443-571-3354) requesting the return of his firearm which was previously seized by M/Tpr. Claycomb on February 22, 2023. A review of the case revealed Decker was not to possess firearms as the result of a probation restriction related to a traffic offense and his supervised probation status ended on April 13, 2023. A further review of Deckers records indicated he has satisfied the conditions of his probation and arrangements were made to return his firearm (NTN #102XFVH4N).    On April 24, 203, I responded to Deckers residence (8311 Bufflehead Dr., Dundalk, MD 21222) and released the firearm (Canik, Mete SFT, 9mm, S/N- 21CC11786) to him. Decker was provided copies of the MSP Form 67 (chain of custody) and MSP Form 63 (property record) for his records.    Case closed.</NarrativeText>
