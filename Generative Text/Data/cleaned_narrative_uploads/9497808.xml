         <NarrativeText>DUI ARREST Body worn camera available for Tpr Marlatt, TFC Breakall, and TFC Oyola. B-39 is not equipped with an in car camera. Attachments: Copies of citations. Copies of MVA returns. Copy of DR-15. Copy of DR-15 A. Copy of Intoximeter Results. Copy of MSP Form 33. Defendant: Jeremy Bruce Ace Date of Birth: 04/26/1986 Date of Arrest: 04/15/2023 Time of Arrest: 2302 MD License #: MD10272928492  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES     Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, December 2022.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On 04/15/2023 at approximately 2252 hours, I, Trooper Justin Marlatt currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack, was operating marked Maryland State Police vehicle B-39 in the area of East Street in front of the Frederick Visitors Center. At this time, I observed a Mitsubishi Outlander operating without any registration plates traveling in lane 1.  The vehicle crossed the solid yellow line on the left side of the road twice with its driver side wheels for 2-3 seconds just prior to the traffic circle. Additionally, the vehicle nearly ran up onto a curb when exiting a traffic circle.  At this time I activated my emergency equipment, in order to initiate a traffic stop. The vehicle came to a stop on Monocacy Blvd in the area of Buckeystown Pike. The vehicle had a rear license plate cover with a handwritten Pennsylvania tag number on a piece of loose leaf paper affixed to it.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the vehicle on the drivers side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle. I informed the operator the reasons for the stop were for operating without registration plates and for crossing the solid yellow line. I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  I requested his drivers license, which he presented. The driver was identified by his Maryland license as Jeremy Bruce Ace 04/26/1986. While speaking with Ace, I observed that his eyes were glossy and that his speech was choppy and slurred. I asked Ace how much he had to drink and he stated two beers.  A check through MVA revealed that Aces license was valid. He had no open warrants.  I asked Ace where he had been drinking and he told me the union. I requested that Ace exit the vehicle. As I communicated with Ace outside of the vehicle, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. When exiting the vehicle, Ace used his left hand to steady himself against the vehicle. I asked Ace to perform standardized field sobriety test and he agreed.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed in the roadway of Monocacy Blvd. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of street lights and my flashlight. Ace appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. Prior to beginning the test I deactivated my vehicles forward facing emergency lights.  I asked Ace the following questions:  Glasses or Contacts  Glasses Medical Conditions  None Injuries  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. It was held approximately 12-15 inches from Aces eyes, slightly above his eye level. Ace was instructed to look straight ahead, keep his head still, and follow the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Ace was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Aces pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes   Resting nystagmus not present. Vertical nystagmus not present. WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Ace was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe on the solid white line. Ace was then instructed to place his hands flat at his sides. Ace was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. On the ninth step, he was instructed to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. After the turn, Ace was instructed to complete the second series of nine (9) steps in the same heel to toe fashion. Ace was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides. I asked Ace if he had any questions and he confirmed that he did not.  Ace performed this test wearing dress shoes.  Instructional Stage:    Could not remain in the instructional position. He moved his feet off of the line.   Walking Stage (1st Nine)    Missed heel to toe steps 7,8.  Stepped off line steps 4,6.  Raised arms above his waistline.  Incorrect number of steps (10)   Turn: Improper lacking the small steps required.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine)    Stopped walking  Missed heel to toe steps 1, 5.  Stepped off line steps 3, 4.  Raised arms above his waistline.  Incorrect number of steps (11)   Ace was extremely unsteady on his feet during this test.  ONE LEG STAND (4/4 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Ace was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch the raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, etc) and to not put his foot down until the end of the test. I asked Ace if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.  Instructional Stage: Ace was slightly swaying and bobbing his head during the instructional phase.  Balance and Count Stage:    Swayed side to side.  Hopped once.  Raised arms from his side.  Put foot down twice.   Ace counted to 21. Ace did not count in the manner he was instructed to, omitting the one thousand when counting. Aces speech continued to be very slurred.  While on scene, I informed Ace of his Preliminary Breath Test Rights. Ace was offered a PBT, to which he consented. I administered the PBT with a result of .196 BrAC. I asked Ace again how many alcoholic beverages he had and he stated 3 long island ice teas.  ARREST  Based on the totality of circumstances, I had reason to believe Ace was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Failure to keep the vehicle to the right of the solid yellow line.  Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Aces breath and person.  Glossy eyes, slurred speech, unsteadiness when exiting the vehicle.  Clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Testing: HGN (6/6), WAT (7/8), OLS (4/4).  Driver changing his account from consuming 2 beers to consuming three long island ice teas.  PBT result of .196.    At 2302 hours, I placed Ace under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. I immediately notified the barrack, and searched his person for weapons and contraband, both with negative results.  Ace was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy. Ace was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights in English. Ace agreed to take an alcohol concentration test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD  I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Ace beginning with his arrest. A preliminary search of Ace was conducted on scene and it revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. I observed Ace from the time of arrest until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Sgt Hill of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Ace had a result of .23 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 2339 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT  .23 BrAC  I processed Ace and released him to his Ex-Wife with whom he still resides. Aces speech was still slurred and he remained unsteady when walking and moving about. He was issued the following citations:  CITATIONS: 02F0YXC 02G0YXC 02H0YXC 0290YXC 02B0YXC 02C0YXC 02D0YXC  The defendant was issued copies of the following documents: -Citations ( listed above ) -Intoximeter results. -DR-15 Advice of Rights. -DR-15a Order of Suspension. The vehicle was secured on scene.  Case Status: Cleared via arrest.  All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
