         <NarrativeText>MSP marked vehicle S-45 is equipped with a mobile recording device and the incident was recorded.     Defendant: Jason Michael Huffer Date of Birth: 08/28/1999 Date of Arrest: 02/26/2023 Times of Arrest: 0321 hours DUI #: 23-015 (Centreville Barrack)   CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On 02/26/2023 at approximately 0303 hours, I, TFC Foley #6839 of the Maryland State Police - Centreville Barracks, was dispatched to the area 28850 River Road, Millington, Kent County, Maryland for a motor vehicle collision.  Upon arrival, I observed a single vehicle collision involving a blue Dodge Ram 1500 bearing Maryland registration 3FF5826 with heavy front end damage in the right shoulder and overturned on its roof. The vehicle appeared to have struck and damaged approximately 50 feet worth of metal guardrail that was along the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. I observed a white male standing outside the vehicle on the shoulder of the roadway next to a dark-colored truck of a concerned citizen that stopped to render aid and assistance. I identified the white male as Jason Michael Huffer, W/M, DOB 8/28/1999 by his Maryland drivers license. Huffer stated he was the driver of the Dodge Ram that was involved in the collision. Huffer advised that while traveling Eastbound of Route 291, he assumes he dozed off to sleep, causing him to strike the front face of the guardrail, then rolled his vehicle off the right-handed shoulder of the roadway where the vehicle came to rest on its roof.Huffer did not have any complaints of injury or pain.  See the attached motor vehicle collision report in ACRS for additional details on the collision.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) When I made contact with Huffer, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. His eyes had a glassy and reddish hue to them. I asked Huffer if he had any alcoholic beverages to drink tonight to which he replied a couple drinks with a buddy in Rock Hall, Maryland.As I observed Huffer on scene, he was unsteady on his feet and swayed left and right as he walked. Huffer also leaned against any vehicle that was near him to maintain his balance. I informed Huffer that I wanted him to perform field sobriety tests, to which he consented.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on the right-hand shoulder side of Route 291. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 40 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of light from my patrol vehicle headlight and spotlight, and my flashlight. Huffer appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. Huffer was also asked if he wanted to be checked by emergency personnel prior to the tests, to which he refused and stated that he was just shaken up from the incident.  I asked Huffer the following questions:  Injuries  No Medication - None Medical Conditions  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my right index finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Huffers eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. He was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic and flashing emergency lights would not interfere with the test results. Huffers pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I asked Huffer if he understood the instructions, and he stated yes.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed)  Prior to Huffer performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Huffer was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Huffer was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Huffer was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Huffer was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Huffer was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Huffer was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Huffer was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Huffer if he understood the test, and he stated, Yes. A painted white fog line was used for Huffer to walk on during this test.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Could not maintain balance - Feet broke apart.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Used arms for balance 2.) Missed heel to toe on steps 4 and 5 by more than half an inch  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Stepped off-line on step 5 2.) Missed heel to toe on step 5 by more than half an inch 3.) Used arms for balance 4.) Incorrect number of steps, took 10 steps  Turn: 1.) Improper turn  took several steps to the right.   ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed)  Prior to Huffer performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Huffer was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Huffer if he understood the test, and he stated yes.  Instructional Stage: 1.) Nothing to report.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Used arms for balance.  Seconds 11-20: 1.) Used arms for balance.  Seconds 21-30: 1.) Used arms for balance  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST **.11BrAC**  At the conclusion of the field sobriety tests, I offered Huffer a Preliminary Breath Test to which he complied agreeing to take the test.    ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Huffer was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   *Striking the guardrail causing the Dodge Ram to then roll out of control and come to rest off the right shoulder of the roadway on its roof.  *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. *My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests. *PBT Result *.11 BrAC**   I arrested Huffer for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0321 hours, and he was then asked again by emergency personnel to be checked out at the scene for any signs of injury in the back of Kent Ambulance #2. Subsequently, Huffer was transported to University of Maryland at Shore Regional Hospital in Chestertown Maryland for precautionary purposes. I then followed Kent Ambulance #2 to the hospital, while a Kent County Sheriffs Deputy remained on scene awaiting the tow company for the vehicle. While at the hospital, I read the English version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Huffer. At the conclusion of the DR-15, I verbally repeated and reviewed the possible suspensions and sanctions that can be imposed by the MVA per the DR-15 form. Huffer agreed to submit a test of blood and signed the DR-15 indicating the same at approximately 0401 hours. Huffer also signed blood test consent form in the kit. A blood test was completed by Laura Matthews, RN, at University of Maryland at Shore Regional Hospital Chestertown Maryland at approximately 0440 hours and documented on the MSP Form 34 indicating the same.  BLOOD KIT TEST RESULT:  ***.AWAITING RESULTS FROM CTAU***  Huffer was released on his own recognizance to the hospital staff, and was given all copies of pertinent paperwork. Huffer was polite and cooperative throughout the process.  All events occurred in Kent County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #3 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 7/5/2023, I, TFC Foley #6839, received documentation from the Kent States Attorneys Office on Jason Michael Huffer, W/M, DOB 8/28/1999, for his blood alcohol content from the blood draw kit that was obtained on 2/26/2023 as a result of a motor vehicle collision. Huffers chemical results are attached to this narrative. I also made contact with Huffer on 7/6/2023 at approximately 0735 hours from the Maryland State Police Centreville Barracks telephone. I advised Huffer that I have paperwork documents for him that are related to his motor vehicle collision on 2/26/2023. Huffer advised that he works across the Bay Bridge during the day, during the week and drives past the Barracks each day on his way home from work between 1600 and 1700 hours. Huffer advised that he will stop at the Barracks to pick up his paperwork on 7/6/2023.  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
