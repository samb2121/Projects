         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera Defendant: Michael Edward Zielinski    TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,000 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On March 18, 2023 at approximately 0022 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on Carroll Island approaching Eastern Blvd, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a silver Ford SUV turn right onto Carroll Island from Eastern Blvd. I observed both driver side tires to be missing and the Ford was driving on the rims. I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the Ford that was bearing registration of LND7667.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Ford on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle, who was the only occupant in the vehicle. I explained the reason for the stop and requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. The driver stated that it just happened and he was trying to get to Tavern. He was identified by his Pennsylvania drivers license as Michael Edward Zielinski. While speaking with Zielinski, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I deliberately observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.   I returned to the Ford and requested Zielinski to exit his vehicle and walk to the front. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking with Zielinski outside the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. He continued to tell me that it just happened, but where he said it was, was miles away. When asked about alcohol consumption prior to driving he stated that he had 2 Captain and Cokes and 2 Bud Ices at Muddy Beaver (started at close to 9 ocock, last drink 45 minutes ago). I informed Zielinski that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed at the location of the stop.The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, spotlight, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a hat, black leather jacket, red button up, tan pants, brown boots(tied).  I asked Zielinski the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  Glasses Medication  No Head Injuries  No Problems with knees or ankles  Broken right foot (2009), dislocated left ankle (2020)  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus   Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. He stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Instructional Stage:    Lost balance, stepped completely offline to the right 1 time.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on step 7.  Stopped after step 7 to regain his balance.  Turn: Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Stopped to regain balance prior to starting second 9.  Stepped completely offline by more than a shoe width on steps 2 and 4.   ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. He stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. -Right foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Seconds 11-20:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Right foot hit the ground 1 time  Seconds 21-30:    Swayed body to the left and right.  Right foot hit the ground 2 times.     I will admit I will be over the legal limit.  PBT #209455 with a result of .11 BrAC.  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Zielinski was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0037 hours, I placed Zielinski under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Zielinski with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. He listened to the form from the MVA website. At 0115 hours, Zielinski agreed to take a breath test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Zielinski beginning at 0044 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Zielinski was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by TFC Jackson of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Zielinski had a result of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0126 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****.14 grams of alcohol****  Zielinski was polite and cooperative. He was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
