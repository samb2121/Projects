         <NarrativeText>On 8/22/2023 at approximately 1600 hours, I, Trooper Koehler #7524 responded to 13485 Rustling Oaks Drive, Wye Mills, Talbot County Maryland, for a report of a fraud. Upon my arrival, I spoke with Ruperto Alejandrino Buscaino who advised that unknown suspect(s) scammed his wife out of close to $145,000.00. Ruperto called his wife, who was not there at the time and had her speak with me over the phone. Rupertos wife was identified as Elmyra Valle Encarnacion, as she detailed the series of events that took place.  On 8/8/2023 Elmyra was on her computer and received a security alarm that stated to call Microsoft. Elmyra called the number which she believes was 408-652-9113. She spoke with a subject named Mark Williams, who asked what was going on. This unidentified subject gained access to her computer after Elmyra typed in a website (something.net) into her browser. Elmyra wasnt sure of the website name. Mark Williams asked if she had any credit cards and then put her on a secure line and then transferred the call to a person named, Kevin. Elmyra was told to go get $5,000.00 from Lowes via gift cards and provide the numbers on the back of the cards to Kevin. Elmyra obtained 5, $1,000.00 gift cards and scratched the back, providing the numbers to Kevin. Elmyra was told to go back again and do the same thing. This time she went to Home Depot and obtained 5, $1,000.00 gift cards, scratched the numbers off the back and provided the numbers to Kevin.  On 8/9/2023, Elmyra was told that she needed to get $15,000.00 and take it to the FCC machine. Elmyra was only able to withdrawal $10,000.00 and transported the cash to a BitCoin Machine (FCC Machine) located at 1272 Stoney Run Road Hanover, Maryland 21076. Elmyra walked up to the machine and selected, purchase bit coin. The person identified on the phone, now as George, gave her the telephone number to enter along with a password and a QR code for the destination. During this process, Elmyra was required to enter in her Social Security Number as well. Elmyra then physically entered all $10,000.00 in cash, into the machine.  On 8/10/2023, Elmyra was asked to do the same thing all over again. Elmyra did this again, placing another $10,000.00 in cash, into this same BitCoin Machine in Hanover, Maryland. Elmyra then started talking to someone named Mike Rose with Scott and White Federal Credit Union (which is a bank that she actively has). Mike Rose stated that there was bad news, and there was going to be 2 withdrawals in about 5 hours in the amount of $16,700.00 and $18,450.00 going to online casino in Moscow Russia. Mike Rose wanted her to transfer $45,000.00 into her Bank of America account. Elmyra then wired the $45,000.00 to her Bank of America account and Mike Rose wanted her to withdrawal that money. Mike Rose told her to write two checks to herself, one for $20,000.00 and the other for $25,000.00. Elmyra then goes to her Bank (Bank of America) and withdrawals $25,000.00 in cash from a check. Elmyra then went to a different BitCoin Machine, located at 139 Orville Road, Essex, Maryland 21221 and puts that cash into the machine.  On 8/11/2023 Elmyra went to the Glen Burnie Bank of America and withdrawals $20,000.00 in cash and drove to the Hanover BitCoin Machine to place the money into it. Mike Rose then tells her that there is more bad news, stating that there will be approximately $500,000.00 withdrawn from her account that will go to an Afghanistan gun deal and all the proof was pointing to her. Elmlyra was told that she had to withdrawal $300,000.00 from her Vangaurd account and place it into her Bank of America account. On 8/16/2023, she was able to do this.  On 8/12/2023 a New Jersey phone number contacted Elmyra, stating it was Mark Williams from Microsoft and informed her that she was going to have to get a new phone. Elmyra proceeded to get a new phone with a new phone number. Elmyra was contacted by Mike Rose who wanted her to open a bank account with Wells Fargo or PNC. Elmrya opened an account with PNC and placed $100.00 in it. Elmyra proceeded to open another account with Wells Fargo and wired $100,000.00 into it. Elmyra was then told to withdrawal $50,000.00 from her Bank of America accountand $20,000.00 from her new Wells Fargo account and take all $70,000.00 in cash to a different BitCoin Machine located at 523 Emancipation Highway in Fredricksburg, Virginia. Elmyra was only able to place $42,000.00 into this machine. Elmyra went to a different BitCoin Machine, located in Stafford, Virginia to deposit the rest of the $70,000.00.  Elmyra was then asked to take out another $50,000.00 from her Wells Fargo account. Elmyra only withdrew $10,000.00 and went to the BitCoin Machin in Stafford, Virginia again, this time only depositing $8,000.00 into the machine.  In total, Elmyra had approximately $153,000.00 stolen from her via the above detailed Microsoft Hacking scam.  Finally, Elmyra got upset about all of this and told Mike Rose that she couldnt do this anymore. No more fraudulent transactions took place.  Elmyra and her husband wrote a detailed narrative of the events that took place and provided me with it. They also were able to provide me a list of the names and phone numbers used to make contact with them. They also provided me with the specific QR codes used to make the fraudulent transactions at the various BitCoin Machines.  Elmyra and Ruperto were both advised to file a report with the Social Security Administration along with the FTC and Attorney Generals Office. They were also advised to make a report with the three major credit bureau agencies.  Case Status : Open  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 9/5/2023 at approximately 1320 hours, I, Trooper Koehler #7524 conducted a follow-up regarding this open case. I had several follow-up questions for Ruperto and Elmyra and sent the questions to them via email. The questions and their responses are below :   Was a report filed with the FBI?  No.  However, onAugust 22, 2023, we contacted the FBI field office in Baltimore andwas instructed to file a complaint ontheirIC3 site. As such,wehave filedthis complaint.   What exactly prompted Elmyra to provide the gift card numbers to the suspects? Was she threatened or coerced at this point. I just need to know what exactly made her feel that this needed to be done. If so, what specifically was the threat at this point? Also why exactly did Elmyra need to get $15,000.00 and take it to FCC machine initially? Was there any threats made at this point? In short why did she believe she had to do this?  The suspects led her to believe that they were from the FCC, speaking to her on the phone in a supposedly secure line. She was told that creating a duplicate charge helps the government track down money laundering. Elmyra did not fully understand a duplicate charge or comprehend the situation, since events were happening fast. She felt pressured to do what the suspects said in order to save her money that was going to be withdrawn from her financial institutions. She was told that the money withdrawn from Bank of America would need to be deposited to an FCC machine which would then be deposited in her virtual wallet. She was pressured to do this, since this was the only way to secure her money fast, per suspects.  She was also made to believe that this was a race against time. Throughout the process, the suspects would pressure her to do things quick, led her to believe that they were from the government trying to help her save her money, that they were able to track the hackers/scammers --- from Chicago, China, Russia-- and that they would text her pictures of these bad guys to see if she could identify them. She was told that they have arrested one from Moscow. When she went to the FCC machines, she was made to believe that there was an FCC guard watching her. She was told not to tell her family members. By the end of the first week, Friday, the suspects told her that these money withdrawals were making the government suspect her. Later, the suspects told her that the FCC trusted her, and that she was a victim of identity theft.  She was drawn into an alternate reality wherein the suspects made her believe that they were the good guys trying to quickly save her money, that she was a victim of identity theft, and that they were trying to catch the bad guys. They also said that they could visit us at our home once it is all over to explain everything to my family.  Finally, the suspects told her that they have handled hundreds of similar cases, including a 79 yo lady who they worked with for one year.   Why did Elmyra have to get a new phone?  An unknown number tried calling her Saturday, Aug 12, which she did not answer. Then immediately after that ring, someone named Chris Martin texted her on the old phone who said that he was now handling the case. When she told the suspects that this Chris Martin contacted her, they said that Chris was probably one of the hackers/scammers still trying to get a hold of her, and that she needed to get a new phone. In other words, the suspects led her to think that hackers / scammers were still incessantly trying to reach her. When she asked the suspects how she would know if she was speaking to the right people, they created an ID number FCC 69541 that she could ask anyone before speaking to them.    What exactly was the web address that she entered into the computer when prompted initially about the security alarm?  She cannot remember the whole address but it is believed that it wassource=gmailust=1694184260568000usg=AOvVaw0ViLKNDW-wpe2VOMHrP-Pa" href="http://www.ultraviewer.net---/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ultraviewer.net---this led to a series of computer scanning. A few days after, the suspects asked her to open the ultraviewer app.  Ruperto was asked for all of the account numbers involved in this incident. Ruperto stated, that due to the sensitive nature involved, he would like to hand-deliver this information to me.  Ruperto dropped of a document at the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, which states all of the involved account numbers. The document was added into this report as an attachment. Ruperto further advised that each of the following are either frozen, closed, or inactive.
