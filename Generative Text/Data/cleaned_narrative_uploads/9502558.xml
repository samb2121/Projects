         <NarrativeText>*********L-44 EQUIPPED WITH AUDIO/VIDEO EQUIPMENT********* *********INCIDENT CAPTURED ON BODYCAM AND MVR*********   On 04/08/2023, at approximately 0029 hrs, I was dispatched to the area of Garden Grove Lane, Prince Georges county, MD, for a suspected impaired driver. The call came from a witness who advised a black Jeep (MD 4EZ4452) was unable to maintain its lane and nearly caused multiple collisions. Once on scene the witness advised that the vehicle and driver were stopped in the road around the corner. I activated my emergency equipment and performed a traffic stop on the vehicle which was in fact stopped in the roadway with the driver exiting the vehicle as I pulled up.  The driver was later identified as Courtney Xavier Bass (DOB 09/30/1977) via his MD drivers license (MD MD-10273086719). Bass exited the vehicle and began walking towards his residence, I asked him if the vehicle was his and he denied it despite knowing I watched him exit the drivers seat. I advised Bass, who was still walking towards his front door, that he was currently being detained and he was not permitted to enter the residence. Bass then stopped and walked towards me. I advised Bass of the calls we received and he advised he fell asleep. When asked how much he had to drink he advised he had a couple. I observed Bass speech to be slurred, his eyes bloodshot and watery, and the odor of an alcoholic beverage about his breath and person. Basss wife was on scene as well as he had called her out of the house to park the car for him as he was unable to do so himself due to his intoxicated state. Bass again attempted to enter his residence after retrieving the registration from his vehicle and I advised him not to enter the residence. Bass raised his hands above his head and when asked why he stated he watched the news channel.  Once backup was on scene I requested Bass participate in Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. Bass repeatedly advised Im home multiple times when asked if he wanted to participate. I advised refusal of Standardized Field Sobriety will result in his arrest and reminded him of the circumstances of the situation and he agreed to participate in Standardized Field Sobriety Testing. Bass stated he did not have any injuries or conditions that would deter him from completing any tests. Bass stated he did not need glasses to see. I explained and then demonstrated each of the tests to Bass before he began. Bass did not have any questions about any of the tests and he advised that he understood all of the instructions given. The ground used was the asphalt surface of the roadway in front of my vehicle, which was level and reasonably free from debris. I continued to smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Bass breath and person.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus - 6 of 6 clues Bass eyes were bloodshot and watery. Both eyes tracked equally and both pupils were equally sized. Bass exhibited the following clues: - Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes - Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes - Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes Misc.  Bass repeatedly anticipated the movements of the stimulus and often times did not follow the stimulus; despite repeating the directions multiple times. Vertical Gaze Nystagmus present  Walk and Turn - 6 of 8 clues - Starts too soon: Started at the appropriate time but without being instructed to - Incorrect number of steps: 12 on first set, 10 on second set - Missed heel to toe several times - Stepped off line several times - Improper turn - Stops walking after turn  One Leg Stand - 3 of 4 clues - Swayed while balancing - Used arms for balance throughout the test - Put foot down multiple times Misc.  repeatedly miscounted  Bass was offered a Preliminary Breath Test and agreed to take it. Bass provided a sufficient sample of .17BrAC  Bass was arrested at 0051 hrs on 04/08/2023. Bass was processed on scene and elected to listen to an English audio recording of the DR15 advice of rights. Once Bass was finished listening to the DR15 audio, he refused to take the Intoximeter breath test. Bass signed the Dr15 at approximately 0103 hrs on 04/08/2023. Bass was provided with a copy of all pertinent paperwork and issued the appropriate charges. Bass was released to his wife shortly after processing was complete. Bass became slightly irritated and demanded the ID numbers of myself, the backup trooper, and both my Corporal and Sergeant. Bass was provided with all requested information. All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland </NarrativeText>
