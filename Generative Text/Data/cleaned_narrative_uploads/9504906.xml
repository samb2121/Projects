         <NarrativeText>ATTACHMENTS:  - NCMEC Cybertip # }br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;  161642791   Narrative  On 5/23/23, the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Section /Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force received NCMEC CyberTip # 161642791. The Cyber Tip, generated by TikTokindicated that a subject uploaded child pornography to the internet. The CyberTip was assigned to TFC Cooke for investigation.    The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the suspect:  Address: US Email Address: foxxtrot5551@gmail.com Screen/User Name: sailorthebeardie IP Address: 71.200.182.206 (Login) 03-15-2023 11:37:28 UTC    The CyberTip contained 1 reported child pornography file. TFC Cooke reviewed the reported child pornography file and determined that it constitutes child pornography as it is defined under Maryland law. The file is described below:    Filename:72294832774873608141616427910.mp4  Description: 1 minute color video of a fully nude white male (MALE #1), reasonably believed to be between 8 - 10 years of age, sitting on a toilet as another white male (MALE #2), reasonably believed to be between 13 - 15 years of age based on limited imagery of his leg and hand, kicks and harasses MALE #1. MALE #2 then focuses the camera on MALE #1s penis and holds his thumb and index finger up to the camera to appear as if hes measuring MALE #1s penis. MALE#1 is underdeveloped, devoid of pubic hair, and noticeably small compared to the size of the toilet and MALE#2.    The CyberTip indicated that the following IP address 71.200.182.206 (03-15-2023 00:48:49 UTC) was utilized to upload the reported contraband file.    TFC Cooke conducted a query of the upload IP address through an open-source database and determined that it is registered through Comcast and geo-locates generally to the Elkton area of Cecil County, Maryland.    TFC Cooke conducted a query of the email address (foxxtrot5551@gmail.com) associated with the suspect TikTok accountthrough an open-source database and determined that it is registered to Albert Long. A query through law-enforcement databases revealed multiple domestic and drug-related incidents associated with Albert Francis Long 4th (2/M DOB: 8/6/85). One such report detailed information regarding Alberts five children, all of which are juveniles in custody of Child Protective Services. TFC Cooke reached out to the reporting officer, Detective Tyler Shaff (Baltimore County Police Department - Crimes Against Children), who redirected to the CPS case agent, Mackenzie Cooke (Baltimore County Department of Social Services). A screenshot of MALE #1s face was provided to CPS Agent Cooke who advised that she recognized the individual as one of Albert Longs children and would provide complete details including his current foster home address as soon as possible.   On 5/26/23, Baltimore County CPS provided foster home information (Kenneth  Victoria Newkirk, 63 Winslow Dr, Elkton, MD 21921). On the same day, TFC Cooke and D/Sgt Zeller conducted a knock  talk at that address and made contact with both foster parents. Investigators identified both the victim and aggressor in the Tiktok video as brothers and two of the current foster children under the Newkirks guardianship, Gavin Long (2/M 8/20/16, hereby known as G.L.) and Albert Long 5th (2/M 9/18/11, hereby known as A.L.), respectively. Knowing and voluntary consent was given to investigators to search A.L.s cell phone - no contraband/suspicious activity observed. Both foster parents were cooperative and agreed to restrict A.L.s internet/phone usage. G.L. was briefly interviewed while accompanied by both foster parents. The Cecil County States Attorneys Office, Cecil County Child Advocacy Center, and Baltimore County Department of Social Services were updated - no criminal enforcement action/foster care alterations were recommended.   Case Status  CLOSED BY EXCEPTION   </NarrativeText>
