         <NarrativeText>*The following incident was captured on body-worn camera and MVR.  DEFENDANT: Corey Sheldon Grant Jr. GA Drivers License:059088714 Date of Birth:01/30/1992 Date of Arrest: 09/16/2023 Time of Arrest: 0028 Hours DUI #:23-MSP-032498(Frederick Barrack)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training. * I have successfully completed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Standardized Field Sobriety Testing  Instructor Development Course.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1): On Friday, September 15, 2023, at approximately 2358 hours I, Trooper Kittoe (#7361), currently assigned to the Maryland State Police  Frederick Barrack was on patrol in the area of Route US-15 North and Rosemont Ave, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland. At that time, I observed a black Audi A3 bearing MD registration 4EX5028 parked partially in the roadway.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2): Upon stopping out with the vehicle for a welfare check, I approached the front passenger-side window of the vehicle and asked the female passenger if she and the driver were okay, to which she responded Yes. The driver of the vehicle who was later identified as Corey Sheldon Grant Jr (Dob: 01/30/1992) then stepped out of the Audi, walked around it, and appeared to be inspecting the vehicle. I asked Grant why they were parked on the shoulder. Grant appeared to be incoherent and ignored my question. I then asked again What is going on?, to which he responded I dont know, but my car started something. Grants speech was slurred, and his eyes appeared to be bloodshot and glassy. Grant then walked to the side of the Audi and continued to inspect the vehicle. At that time, I asked Grant to walk towards me since he was in the roadway and in danger of oncoming traffic. Grants behavior mimicked someone under the influence of alcohol or drugs based on my training knowledge and experience, so I asked Grant how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed. Grant stated Nothing. Grant then stated, I am literally coming from picking somebody up. While talking to Grant he could not stay stable, he continued moving around. I asked Grant to move to a safer place on the shoulder, but Grant ignored my request and continued to move closer to the shoulder. Out of concern for Grants safety, I pulled him by the back of his shirt and gently assisted him to a safer area on the shoulder. I then asked where he was coming from. Grant stated, I am coming from picking my friend up to get her boyfriend. I asked Grant if he was driving to which he stated Yes. I asked Grant if he had anything to drink to which he stated No. I then asked Grant if he had anything to smoke (referring to CDS use). Grant stated, A little bit, earlier, no, I am not under the influence of anything. I asked Grant for his drivers license and advised him to get back in his vehicle. Grant initially went back to the drivers seat. I then asked Grant to move to the front passenger seat due to his condition. Grant appeared to not know where the front passenger seat was. He walked around the vehicle and stood on the shoulder for a moment, not knowing where to go. I subsequently assisted him by telling him where to go.   I advised Grant that I was going to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to make sure that he was okay to drive. Grant agreed to the test . PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3): The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of Route US-15 south prior to Rosemont Avenue, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland. The asphalt surface was solid, dry, flat, and free from any debris. Lighting conditions consisted of vehicle headlights, flashlight, and streetlamps. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Grant appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any physical injuries. I asked Grant the following questions:  Physical Injuries - None. Medical Conditions - None. Medications - None Glasses and/or contacts - None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) Prior to beginning the test, Grant was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. He was then given the instructions for the test and was asked if he understood, to which he stated Yes. His pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.  * Resting Gaze Nystagmus was present in both eyes. *Grant initially had difficulty focusing on the stimulus as instructed. He gazed straight ahead after advising him numerous times to focus on the tip of the stimulus.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit-Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation-Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees-Present in both eyes.  *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) Prior to Grant performing the test, I demonstrated and instructed him to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot touching heel to toe and to place his arms down at his sides. He was instructed to remain in the starting position until told to begin, to which he acknowledged that he understood. I then demonstrated and instructed how the test should be conducted. Grant was asked if he understood the test to which he stated, Yes.  *Grant was wearing canvas type sneakers.  Instructional Stage: *Grant placed his left foot in front of the right foot after instructing him to place his right foot directly in front of the left heel to toe.  Balance: Grant could not maintain his balance. He used the vehicle behind him for support by placing his right hand on it. Shortly after, Grant stepped to his left side once with his right leg and then used the vehicle again for support by placing his right hand on the vehicle.  Starts too soon: No clue  Walking Stage (1st Nine):  *During the test, Grant asked to take off his shoes. I agreed and allowed Grant to take off his shoes for the test. I then asked him to restart the walk-and-turn test. Grant performed the test wearing black socks  - Uses arms for balance (Steps 2 through 9) - Actual steps taken (12 steps) - Stops walking  *After completing the first part of the walk and turn test, Grant took approximately 5 heel-to-toe steps backward, then took 5 heel-to-toe steps forward and stopped. I asked Grant if he was done with the test. Grant appeared to be disoriented and mumbled words that I could not understand. I then instructed Grant to continue the test by pointing in which direction to walk.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): - Uses arms for balance (Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9) - Actual steps taken (13 steps) - Steps off line (Step 8)  Turn - Grant did not complete the turn correctly.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed) Prior to Grant performing the test, I demonstrated and instructed him to stand with his feet together and arms down by his sides while the instructions were given. I then demonstrated and instructed how the test should be conducted. I asked Grant if he understood my instructions to which he stated Yes.  *Grant lifted his right foot for the test.  Balance and Counting Stage: Counts 1 through 10: Used arms for balance (Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 through 10) Sways (Count 6)  Count 11 through 20: Used arms for balance (Counts 11 12, 13, 14,16 through 20) Sways (Count 15)  Counts 21 through 30: Used arms for balance (21, 24 through 30) Sways (Count 22) Puts foot down (Count 23)  Preliminary Breath Test A preliminary breath test was not offered  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Grant was operating a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs:  - Glassy eyes. - Slurred speech - Disoriented behavior - Driver admitting to smoking (referring to CDS use) prior to driving. - Clues observed during standardized field sobriety testing.  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Grant was driving while impaired by drugs and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0028 hours (12:28 AM), I placed Grant under arrest for Driving While Impaired by Drugs. A search incident to the arrest of Grant was conducted on scene with negative results.  Grant was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack for processing.  Upon arrival at the Frederick Barrack, the DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to Grant in English (Audio recording). Grant was provided with the DR-15 to read over. At 0103 hours, Grant agreed to take the breath test. The intoximeter test was conducted by Cpl. Mattingly (#4491) at approximately 0112 hours.  Test Results * .00 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  I advised Grant that I was going to request the presence of a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE). Grant initially agreed to speak a DRE, but later refused stating that he was uncomfortable waiting too long for the DRE in the holding cell. Cpl. Mattingly (#4491) and I explained to Grant that he had to wait in the holding cell while I completed the paperwork for his arrest. Grant was advised that there was no estimated time of arrival for the DRE. At that time, Grant refused to speak to the DRE.   All appropriate citations were issued to Grant. He was provided with copies of all pertinent paperwork. At approximately 0205 hours, Grant was transported to his mothers residence at 537 Ellrose Court, Frederick, Maryland.  All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.  the converter appeared to be cut off with a reciprocating saw </NarrativeText>
