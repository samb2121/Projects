         <NarrativeText>On 06/27/2023, at approximately 1523 hours, I, TFC Bagonis #6561, was on-duty working an anti-crime assignment in Elkton, Cecil County, Maryland. During the course of my duties I assisted the Elkton Police Department with the investigation of an incident. The Elkton Police Department received a call for shoplifting at the Elkton Walmart. The suspects were persons of interest for a felony theft at the same location the day before. Prior to locating the suspects, it was relayed from Delaware law enforcement that the suspects and vehicle involved were also persons of interest in burglaries in their jurisdiction.  During the incident as I was looking for one of the suspects when he observed my black unmarked Tahoe, the suspect took off running. I encountered him laying prone in grass next to a tree located in the yard of 141 N. Tartan Dr. Elkton, Maryland 21921. The suspects hands were not visible and close to their body, and I was unable to determine if there were armed. I was clearly identified as a Police Officer by the Police placards on my MSP approval tactical vest. Due to the suspect refusing to show their hands I drew my approved duty weapon and began issuing loud verbal commands for the suspect to show me their hands and Dont move. The suspect eventually complied with my commands and was arrested by the Elkton Police Department without incident.  After the arrest no additional force was shown, or used. Neither law enforcement nor the suspect were injured during this incident.  The suspect was later identified as Rickey Daniel Smith (DOB 12/30/1980 W/M).  This concludes my assistance in this incident.  All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
