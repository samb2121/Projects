         <NarrativeText>Reporting: TFC J Ingram// Body Worn Camera Activated  Attachments: MVA Printouts Missing Report Forms  Victim: Glenwood Mcleod Rosevear DOB 07/2/1979  Suspect: Madelyn Irene Rosevear DOB 08/11/2006  Scene Processing: Body Worn Camera was activated and captured the entire incident  Narrative: On December 23, 2023, I, TFC J. Ingram responded to 101 Challedon Drive, Walkersville, Frederick County, Maryland 21793 for a runaway juvenile. I arrived to the residence and spoke to Glenwood Rosevear, DOB: 07/02/1979. Glenwood advised yesterday, 12/22/2023, in the evening he went to his basement and observed his 17-year-old daughter alone with three juvenile boys. Glenwood advised it appeared they were drinking alcohol. Glenwood advised he kicked the three boys out of his house and sent his daughter, Madelyn Irene Rosevear DOB: 08/11/2006, upstairs to her siblings room. Glenwood advised he contacted his ex-wife about what had just occurred, when his daughter ran down the stairs and left the residence in an unknown location. Glenwood advised on 12/22/2023, he contacted with Maryland State Police dispatch and TFC Devin responded; however, he was unsure to why a report was not taken. Glenwood described his daughter to be wearing a black tank top or halter top with camouflage baggie pants(oversized) and possibly black and white converse. Glenwood continued to describe his daughter to have old cut markings on her inner thighs and outer arms. He stated she was EPd in July 2023 for suicidal threats. Glenwood advised she left the residence between 7:00 pm to 8:45pm. Glenwood advised that he was able to find out the names of some to the juvenile males: Cory Jones, Alejandro Estrada, and Blake. Glenwood advised he went to 9314 A Libery Road, Frederick, Maryland; because he received information that Madelyn was dropped off there. He advised he made contact with three juvenile females, and they all denied that Madelyn was there. TFC Riggs went to the residence, however was unable to locate Madelyn. TFC Riggs checked Alejandros address off Dublin Road, Walkersville, MD, he was unable to locate Madelyn there. A friend of Madelyn had contacted Glenwoods ex-wife via telephone; Braden Smith 410-227-8782. Braden advised Madelyn had been in contact with him via Instagram (username: 2faded2function theyhateddylrealbad) and that she was afraid to come home because her parents are mad at her. Braden advised that Madelyn sent him a message stating that the cops had just left, and she was hiding under a blanket in the closet. He continued to state that she was at a house with a dog named Coco. All Missing person paperwork has been completed to include an MSP form 79D (Search Urgency Form) the total was an 18. CED has been notified and TFC Potvin has made contact with me.   All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  Case Status: Open</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Narrative: On December 23rd, 2023 at approximately 1049 hours, I received a phone call from the Frederick Barrack Duty Officer, Cpl Baum. Cpl Baum requested assistance in locating a missing juvenile,Madelyn Rosebear (DOB: 08/11/2006). Cpl Baum also stated that Rosebear has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, depression, and ADHD, and was hospitalized by Frederick City Police in July due to suicidal ideations.  I contacted TFC Ingram, who was on scene with the family. Ingram stated that Rosebear had been in contact with a friend, identified as Braden Smith, via Instagram Messaging. Smith identified Rosebears account astheyhatedylrealbadwith a vanity of2faded2function.I submitted an exigent request to Meta, Inc. requesting information on the account for the last 24 hours at approximately 1111 hours. Meta provided the most recent log in IPv6 of2601:014e:c000:2c30:490e:2d18:4ae9:1046 further providing that the account was logged into at 15:49:53 hrs UTC on December 23rd. A check through Maxmind revealed that this IP address was leased to comcast.  I then contacted Comcast and provided them with the above IPv6, requesting an emergency disclosure of the subscriber data. Comcast provided the following subscriber information by telephone: Sunny Falcon 9314 Liberty Road Apt A Frederick, MD 21701   Troopers with the MSP Frederick Barrack responded to the above address and located Rosebear hiding in a closet in the apartment.  This concludes my involvement in this case. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Narrative:   On December 22, 2023, I, TFC Devin (7046) was advised to call a complainant by telephone in reference to his daughter that left the residence. I called the number that was provided by the Maryland State Police Frederick Barrack, and spoke to Glenwood Rosevear, DOB: 07/02/1979. Rosevear advised that on 12/22/2023 at approximately 22:00 hours his daughter left his residence located at, 101 Challedon Drive, Walkersville, Frederick County, Maryland 21793. Prior to Madelyn Rosevear leaving the residence he went to his basement and observed his 17-year-old daughter alone with three young males. Glenwood advised it appeared they were drinking alcohol that was mixed with orange soda. Glenwood advised he kicked the three males out of his house and sent his daughter, Madelyn Irene Rosevear DOB: 08/11/2006, upstairs. Rosevar later went to check on his daughter, and she left the residence, and was unable to locate her. He did not believe she was in danger, but was upset that his daughter did not listen.   Rosevear assumed that his daughter left the residence with the three males that were previously in the residence. I asked for descriptions of the males and their physical appearance. I was able to identify two of the three males. The two males who I was familiar with was Alejandro Louis Estrada, H/M, (DOB: 04/26/2005), and Cory Jones. I located both of these males in RMS, and were able to make contact with them by telephone. Alejandro explained that Madelyn did leave her residence with them, and they were hanging out. At approximately 22:30 hours, Madelyn left them to hang out with her female friend Lexie. I told both Alejandro and Cory that if they see or talk to Madelyn to tell her to return home.   I called Madelyns father to relay the information, and asked if he wanted to file a missing persons report. Glenwood Rosevear advised that he did not want to file a missing persons report for this incident. Glenwood Rosevear advised that he just wanted me to keep an eye out for her while I was on patrol. Glenwood asked if I locate his daughter could I take her to the jail to scare her. I advised that if I located her that she would be returned home to the residence and his custody.   All the above events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
