         <NarrativeText>Narrative:  On 5/21/2023 at approximately 0041 hours, I was dispatched to 9600 Cordova Rd, Easton MD. In reference to a check welfare.  Upon my arrival, I met with the complainant Dina Marie Spry and the suspect Somer Eileen Wilkes, who were both on the front porch, and I observed Wilkes to be heavily intoxicated. Spry stated the following. She received a phone call from her sister, Carol Ann Wise and was told that Wilkes was holding a blanket over Wilkes infants face. Wilkes was drunk and she is not supposed to be drinking, due to a current open Department of Social Services case. I asked Spry for her identification, as she walked to her vehicle. At that time, I made contact with Wilkes.  I questioned Wilkes on what happened and she stated nothing. I then asked Wilkes if she needed EMS to come check on her due to her intoxication, which she refused. I questioned Wilkes if the infant was ok, as she nodded yes, waved me into the residence and walked me to the infants location. Wilkes walked me into a bedroom where I observed a sleeping toddler and an infant who was stirring around. The infant was not crying, screaming, wheezing or in distress and I did not observe any injuries or signs of injuries on the infant. As Wilkes walked me through her residence, we took a right turn from the front kitchen door into the living room, walked through the living room and made a left turn into the bedroom where the infant and toddler were located. I observed closed window curtains throughout the house and both the living room and bedroom did not appear disturbed. At that time, I walked Wilkes back outside onto the porch.  While on the porch DSS worker Leah Borkowski, contacted Spry. Spry explained to Borkowski that Wilkes was intoxicated and put a blanket of the infants head. Spry then handed me the phone and I spoke with Borkowski. Borkowski stated there is a safety plan in place, but nothing about Wilkes alcohol use. Borkowski stated she needed to contact her supervisor and would be in touch after doing so. I walked back to the porch, gave Spry her phone back, and observed a vehicle pull on scene.  I made contact with Carol Ann Wise, an occupant in the vehicle and she stated the following. Earlier in the evening, she was at Wilkes residence before Wilkes kicked her out and she left without incident, before returning later in the evening. When she returned to the residence, she observed a blanket over Wilkes infant, Wilkess arm over the baby and stating shut up. At that time, she picked the infant up and started patting the infants back. I asked Wise or Spry if they would be willing to take the toddler and infant for the night and Wise stated she would. I asked Spry to contact Borkowski and make sure that was ok. Wise repeated what had happened and she stated she could hear the infant from outside. After the incident, Wise left and contacted Spry and notified her. Spry stated she made contact with Borkowski but was waiting for a call back. While we were waiting I had Spry check on the children.  Borkowski called Spry back and stated the following. After speaking with her supervisor, she asked if either Spry or Wise could stay at Wilkes residence or take the children for the remainder of the weekend, until Monday. Wise stated she was not staying at the house with Wilkes but would take the children home until Monday. Borkowski stated a verbal safety plan would be completed which would allow Wise to take the children until Monday. I then spoke to Borkowski and she confirmed that Wise would be taking the kids until Monday and the on-call worker social worker would contact Wilkes and Wise in the morning to complete the verbal safety plan. I explained to Borkowski that I would assist Wise and Spry gather the children and essential items.  I assisted Wise and Spry with loading up the essential items in Wises vehicle as Wise was holding the infant. The infant began to wheeze and cough, when Wise stated the baby was sick with Rhinovirus. At that time, I requested EMS to respond to my location to check on the infant. Talbot County EMS responded to the residence and transported the infant to University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton (run # 2023-00035983), per Wises request. Wise rode with the infant in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.   Case OPEN pending further investigation.  All events occurred in Talbot County MD</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Interview Jess Flaherty</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On June 21, 2023, at 1524 hours an interview with Jess Flaherty at the Talbot County Child Advocacy Center. The following narrative was authored by CPS Leah Borkowski:  CPS Investigator Kristyn Wheeler and MSP Detective Antel met with resource home/respite provider Jess Flaherty at the Talbot County Child Advocacy Center. Det. Antel told Jess that they had a few questions about how the comments by Scarlett came up.   Jess explained that the first time that everything came up, Scarlett was at Jess home for day respite while another child was at the home as well. Jess explained that the other child shut the bedroom door while Scarlett was playing in the room with Jess daughter, and Scarlett became hysterical and began panicking in the corner of the room.   Jess described that she entered the room and asked Scarlett what was wrong. Scarlett expressed fear and sadness about being in the room while it was locked, despite it not being locked. Jess described another time when she took Scarlett into the bathroom to wash her hands, and Scarlett began crying and hyperventilating about the door being shut. Jess explained that anytime the door is shut while she is in the room, she begins to panic.   Jess shared that once overnights started, Scarlett would wake up every 20 minutes with night terrors where she screams and comes and gets Jess. Jess explained that Scarlett will say  I need water, I need food and says Mommy locks me in the room and I cant eat, she doesnt let me eat and repeats herself saying the same thing.   Jess told Kristyn and Det. Antel about a time when Scarlett told her that she was mean because Jess would not let Scarlett into her bedroom. Jess shared that she asked Scarlett about being let out of her room in the morning, and that Scarlett has told Jess that Scarletts mom hits her, hits her dad, hits Baby David, and that her dad is afraid of her mom.   Jess shared that these disclosures will come up when Jess asks her whats wrong after Scarlett becomes very panicky. Jess explained that there was another time when David was in the family room in a bouncy seat while Jess was in another room, and Davids began screaming so she ran out to the family room. Jess described that Scarlett was in the family room attempting to lift David out of the seat when Jess worried she might accidentally hurt him so she lifted David from Scarletts hands. Jess explained that Scarlett became fearful by this and then told Jess that she hurt David on purpose. Jess told Scarlett that Scarlett did not hurt him on purpose and that it was an accident, but Scarlett repeated that she was bad and did try to hurt him. Jess expressed that she felt Scarlett was regurgitating something that she heard from someone else,   Jess explained that she had spoken with this writer (CPS investigator Leah Borkowski) to seek guidance on what to do and this writer told Jess to start documenting the things that Scarlett disclosed to her. Jess explained that Scarlett disclosed that her mom hits her and David in the face. Jess also reported that Scarlett disclosed that mom puts the pillow over Davids face so he cant breathe. When asked if there was any indication if Scarlett saw those things happen herself, Jess explained that Scarlett said that she saw, as her and David sleep in the bed with their mom, and she saw her mom put the pillow on Davids face.   When asked if Scarlett was able to disclose a number of times that this happened, Jess said that Scarlett could not, and that she also could not give context for when it might have happened. Jess shared that Scarlett disclosed that Mommy doesnt want me.   Jess shared that when she spoke with Dina Spry about being in contact with Ms. Wilkes, Ms. Spry told her that everyone is afraid of Ms. Wilkes, including herself. Jess shared that Scarlett has disclosed that Ms. Wilkes will buy her things if she hits Scarlett, and that sometimes when Scarlett is upset, she will ask Jess will you buy me something if Im happy?   Det Antel and CPS investigator Kristyn Wheeler thanked Jess for the information. </NarrativeText>
