         <NarrativeText>This incident was not captured on In-car camera E-12. In-car camera appeared to be working properly.  This incident was captured on BWC. BWC appeared to be working properly.  https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=294392f3f9784489bdcdf5316e8d0a42partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  SCENE PROCESSING:      I met with the general manger of Pohanka car dealership where I was provided with pertinent paperwork regarding the sale and purchase of the vehicle.  ATTACHMENTS:    One (1) copy of the hit confirmation for stolen vehicle (uploaded to the report) (uploaded to Veripic).    One (1) copy of victims drivers license (uploaded to the report) (uploaded to Veripic).    One (1) copy of the fake drivers license that was used (uploaded to the report) (uploaded to Veripic).    Various copies of fraudulent finance paperwork from dealership (uploaded to the report) (uploaded to Veripic).   NARRATIVE:      On March 30th,2023 at approximately 1017 hours, I, TFC. Hopkins #7202 was dispatched to Pohanka Automotive Group of Salisbury located at, 2013 N. Salisbury Boulevard, Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland 21801 in reference to a fraudulent online car sale.   Upon my arrival, I contacted General Manger, Brett Siock (W/M 11/03/1967). I was informed that Pohanka was contacted by Terry, Mance Edmondson Jr. (W/M 02/18/1977) on March 30th, 2023. Brett advised, Terry received a Virginia temporary tag (TUR8548) in the mail on March 29th, 2023 at 1206 Suffield Drive, McLean, VA 22101, along with other paperwork from Pohanka of Salisbury, congratulating him on the new purchase of a vehicle. The vehicle was identified as a black 2023 Mercedes GLE53C4 (VIN:4JGFD6BB7PA06095) with fifteen (15) miles. I was advised, that Terry was confused and stated, he did not purchase the above said vehicle.    Due to Terry not aware of a car purchase, Pohanka opened an investigation into a fraudulent purchase. It was learned that all Terrys identity information including an old address he had lived in years ago, was used on the finance paperwork for the purchase of the vehicle as well as set up vehicle insurance through Progressive. Paperwork showed that the vehicle was financed through Mercedes-Benz Finical Service for a total of amount of $120,354.00 with a zero ($0) down payment.    On March 30th, 2023 at approximately 1130 hours, I, contacted Terry, where he stated he did not purchase the above said vehicle. I informed Terry to contact his social security administration as well as his bank company to freeze all his accounts to prevent any further fraudulent transactions. I also told Terry to have a credit check done on himself to insure his credit has not been compromised.    On March 30th, 2023 I met with troopers from the CED, where they advised for Terry to contact Montgomery Police Department to file a report for fraud for his identity being used. After speaking with CED, I contacted Terry and told him to contact Montgomery PD to report the fraud. Terry advised, he would call the police the department to file the report.    I was then contacted on March 30th, 2023 by Mercedes Auto Theft Unit, where I spoke with employee, Destiny #1447, who stated they were able to track the vehicle using their On Star vehicle locator system. The vehicle pinged in Columbus Ohio. It is unsure as to exactly where in Ohio the vehicle was located. Destiny advised, once the vehicle was entered into NCIC as stolen, then they would dispatch Ohio law enforcement to the last known location.    On March 30th, 2023 the vehicle was entered into NCIC.    On March 31st, 2023 at approximately 1015 hours, I, TFC. Hopkins responded to the Pohanka dealership where I was able to view video surveillance of when the vehicle was picked up. On February 27th, 2023 at 1230 hours, I observed an all white Ford pickup truck with a black goose neck trailer attached to the truck. I was unable to obtain a company name, tag number, or DOT number from the pickup truck and trailer. I observed the vehicle loaded up onto the trailer, and leave the Pohanka car lot at approximately 1330 hours.    On March 31st, 2023 at approximately 1122 hours, I contacted Destiny to get an update on the vehicles location. The vehicle was pinging in the area of Wellington Woods Boulevard and Wild berry Lane, Columbus Ohio. Destiny advised, the vehicle has been sitting in the same location since March 30th, 2023.    On March 31st, 2023 at approximately 1140 hours, I contacted Franklin County Police Department and spoke with PCO, Marisa Price. Marisa advised, she would dispatch officers to the area where the vehicle was pinging. At approximately 1200 hours, the Salisbury barrack received a hit confirmation on the recovered vehicle. The vehicle was recovered by FCPD officers at 5453 Wellington Wood Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio. The hit confirmation stated, the vehicle was drivable and had temporary tag (T1260980) attached to the vehicle. No one was found in or near the vehicle at the time of recovery. The vehicle was transported to FCPDs impound lot located at 2700 Impound Lot Road.    On March 31st, 2023 at 1212 hours, I contacted Brett and told him the vehicle was recovered, and it would be transported to the police departments impound lot. Brett was giving the address, hours of operation, and phone number for the impound lot. Brett advised, his company would schedule pick up time for the vehicle. Brett advised, once the vehicle was returned to the dealership, he would contact me, so I can respond and take digital photographs of the vehicle.     NCIC # V684904205    I request this case remain OPEN, pending capturing digital photographs of the vehicle.  All events occurred in Wicomico County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On April 10th, 2023 at approximately 1423 hours, I responded to the car dealership where I captured five (5) digital photographs of the vehicle (uploaded to the report). The vehicle had no scratches or damages on or around the vehicle.    The vehicle arrived to the dealership on April 7th, 2023 between the hours of 1700 and 1800 hours. I was able to verify that the VIN number matched to the paperwork.    I researched the IP address that was given and found it to be from a non-traceable VPN, resulting in the inability to identify as suspect.    I request this case be CLOSED, vehicle returned safely to the dealership, no suspect information.  All events occurred in Wicomico County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
