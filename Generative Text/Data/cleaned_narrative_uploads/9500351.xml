         <NarrativeText>Incident Recorded on Axon Body Worn Camera:  On September 4, 2023 at approximately 0920 hours, Maryland State Police Easton Barrack received a phone call for an anonymous complaint advising a vehicle doing burnouts during the night hours and destroying the roadway on Old Skipton Road located in Cordova, Talbot County, Maryland. The complainant also advised that there was a large amount of tire debris left on the roadway from a fresh tire burnout marking in the area of Old Skipton Road and Brooks Lane. I responded to the area and upon arrival, I was able to observe the significant defacement induced to the roadway. Based on my training, knowledge and experience, I was able to confirm that these excessive tire marks were deliberately left in the roadway and were not cause by accident or vehicular malfunction.  Upon my arrival, I first checked the area of Old Skipton Road and Brooks Lane. Old Skipton Road in that area can be described as a two lane roadway, with a single travel lane for traffic to flow in each direction. The roadway is separated by a double yellow center line and no positive median barrier. While on scene at that location, I located several large tire burnout markings across both lanes of travel on the roadway and continuing onto a private driveway. I then followed additional fresh tire burnout marks that continued on Old Skipton Road and lead to the residence 12133 Old Skipton Road Cordova, Talbot County, Maryland. In the driveway, I located a white Ford F-350 that had the two rear tires completely blown out down to the metal rim. From the location of the burnouts on Old Skipton Rd, leading up the driveway, and to the truck were several pieces of tire tread that I followed. I conducted an MVA check on the ford F-350 bearing Maryland registration 1Z1467 and found the registered owner Wyatt Allen Moore (12/15/1998,2/M) with an address at 12133 Old Skipton Road. After checking the stretch of Old Skipton Road from Councell Farms to Davey Tree Company, I located several locations that the roadway was defaced by tire burnouts appearing to be from the same type of tire.  I then went to make contact at the residence and spoke with a female advising the truck belonged to her son. I then made contact with Moore, who was also at the residence and advised him that I was investigating the several burnouts located on Old Skipton Road. Moore denied doing the burnouts to me however he also stated that he has no idea if there was anyone else driving his truck.  Due to the evidence indicating Moore did deface the roadway by doing tire burnouts to the point of blowing out the two rear tires on the Ford F-350 that was registered in his name, he was issued the appropriate citations (1C80V21). Pictures documenting the defacing of the roadway were documented in the attachments portion of this report.  All events occurred in Talbot County, Maryland. I request this case be closed.
