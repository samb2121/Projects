         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-012381  Incident:   Suspicious person  Incident date/time:   April 7, 2023, at approximately 1109 hours  Incident location:   3727 Hanover Pike, Manchester, Carroll County Maryland.  Attachments:   MSP forms 076  Complainant:  Unkle, Jason Michael  DOB: 08/06/1976  Address: 3727 Hanover Pike, Manchester, Carroll County Maryland 21102  Phone number: 410-458-5411  Witness#1:  Unkle, Violet Annabelle  DOB: 03/28/2007  Address: 3727 Hanover Pike, Manchester, Carroll County Maryland 21102  Witness#1 Statement: Statement captured on body camera and MSP form 076  I made contact with Unkle outside the front of her residence. She advised that Olivia was sleeping over, and they were in the basement and someone came into her home. She advised that her parents were away, visiting a college for her brother and nobody should have been home at the time. She said that she heard steps, walking around the house and heard a male on the phone.  Miss Unkle advised that they could not see who it was and did not want to go upstairs to find out. Unklle advised that she called her father to make him aware of what was going on. She advised that the male sounded confused on the phone. She advised that she took a photo of the male when he exited the house and was by his vehicle. She showed me the photograph on her phone and I requested she email me the picture.  Witness#2:  Harian, Olivia Anne  DOB: 02/23/2007  Address: 1791 Lower Forty Drive, Hampstead, Carroll County Maryland 21102  Witness# 2 Statement: Statement captured on body camera and MSP form 076   I spoke to Miss Harian, alongside Miss Unkle, out front of Miss Unkles residence. Miss Harians statement was very similar to Miss Unkles, however she believed the male to wear sweat clothes and had Adidas pants on.  Witness#3:   Unkle, Melissa Anne  DOB: 10/13/1977  Address: 3727 Hanover Pike, Manchester, Carroll County Maryland 21102  Witness#3 Statement:  I made contact with Mrs. Unkle who advised that she was Violet Unkles s mother. She advised that she figured that the person most likely was her neighbors care taker. She said that her neighbor (She could not recall their name) has pretty serious health problems and advised that, she knows they have care takers that come from out of the area. She also advised that the GPSfor the house at 3715, takes you to their residence. As well as 3727 Hanover Pike. Both do not correctly take you to their residence because it is a shared road.  Mrs. Unkle said that she went to the residence and spoke with a caretaker there who advised that the black male was lost, and his instructions were to enter the residence and yell out the patients name to let them know you arrived. Mrs. Unkle said that she was not concerned about this incident because of the confusing GPS situation as well as it being a complete accident from a caretaker of her neighbor, who lives at 3715 Hanover Pike. She said that she did not wish to press charges.  Neighborhood check:   -I conducted a neighborhood check of 308 Swiper Road, in Manchester Carroll County Maryland. I made contact with the homeowner Derek Franz. He was notified of the investigation and had a doorbell camera. I requested Mr. Franz to take a look through his camera, to see if he found anything that could help with this case. He advised that he would and then would contact me if he found anything of value.   -I also conducted a neighborhood check of 3011 Swiper Road, however, I did not get an answer at the door.  Scene processing:   -I obtained both verbal and written statements ( MSP form 076) from Miss Violet Unkle and Olivia Harian   -I conducted a neighborhood check of the area, to try and locate the suspect  Narrative:  On April 7, 2023, at approximately 1114 hours, I was dispatched to 3727 Hanover Pike in Manchester, Carroll County Maryland, for a suspicious person. Prior to my arrival, I spoke to the complainant Jason Michael Unkle (DOB:08/06/1976) over the phone, to gather more information as well as assistance in locating the residence because my GPS was not accurate enough to find the residence.  He provided the above statement and assisted me with locating the residence. I then made contact with two juveniles out front of the residence. They identified themselves to be Olivia Anne Harian ( DOB: 02/23/2007) and Violet Annabelle Unkle (DOB: 03/28/2007). Unkle and Harian provided the above statements and filled out MSP form 076 (Written Statement). They advised that someone was in the house, while they were downstairs and sounded confused, as though he was looking for someone.  The two ladies advised, that they took a picture of him when he went back outside. They showed me the picture and in the picture, you can see a black male wearing a black hat, orange shirt and black pants. The male also had, what looked like a nurses badge around his neck. In the photograph, the male was standing by a gray passenger car on his phone.  While the juveniles filled out the Written Statement Form, I conducted a neighborhood check of the area and went to 3008 Swiper Road and 3011 Swiper Road, in Manchester, Maryland. Both residence were the immediate neighbors of 3727 Hanover Pike address. I made contact with Derek Franz, the homeowner of 3008 Swiper Road, advised him about my investigation and requested he take a look at the ring doorbell camera he has, in order to see if we can get a better description of the vehicle. He advised that he would look into it and contact me by email, if he found anything of value.  I attempted to make contact with the residence at 3011 Swiper Road; however, I was unable to get an answer at the door. I then drove around the area, in an attempt to locate the vehicle in question, but was unable to locate it. I then made contact with both the juveniles again and obtained the written statements from them. They were provided a victim witness pamphlet with, my information and case number. I contacted Mr. Unkle and provided him with an update of the incident.  Later, I spoke with a woman who identified herself to be Melissa Anne Unkle (DOB: 10/13/1977) and who identified herself to be the mother of Violet Unkle. Mrs. Unkle provided the above statement and advised that she found out that, the male worked for a homecare caretaking job and was provided instructions to enter the residence and announce himself to his patient. Mrs. Unkle advised that her neighbor (She could not recall their name) was not in good health and required caretakers to take care of them.  Mrs. Unkle believed that the caretaker accidentally went to the wrong house because the GPS messes up around their residence, for some reason. She believed the house that the caretaker was working was the 3715 Hanover Pike residence that was located, closer towards Hanover Pike (Their residence is further away from Hanover Pike).  A check of the GPS for both 3715 and 3727 Hanover Pike, confirm that both residences are located on the same road, however, the GPS is misleading, and does not correctly place the marker for either locations. 3715 Hanover Pike, comes up as 3727s location on the GPS.  Mrs. Unkle advised that they did not need any further police action and did not want to press charges, because the whole thing, appeared to be a misunderstanding and issue with the GPS and instructions provided to the caretaker to enter the home of their patient. All events occurred in Carroll County Maryland. Case closed.</NarrativeText>
