Arrest was audibly  visually recorded on MVR and BWC - Labeled 23MSP013967 Date of Arrest: 04/20/2023 Time of Arrest: 0001 hours Maryland Soundex:MD-10273225969 DUI Citation #:69C0JFH Barrack DUI Folder #: 23-96-090  TRAINING / CERTIFICATIONS:   Trained and certified to conduct NHTSA Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police Training Academy.  Trained and certified to conduct Preliminary Breath Tests through the Maryland State Police Training Academy.  Trained andcertified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  Trained and certified in Enhanced DUI Enforcement: The Complete Arrest though the Maryland State Police  Trained and certified in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement through the Maryland State Police  Trained and certified as a Basic Breath Test Operator utilizing theIntoximeter EC/IR II through the Maryland State Police   PHASE ONE - VEHICLE IN MOTION:    On 04/19/2023, I (TFC M. Mitchell #6296) was operating in my official capacity as a Maryland State Police Trooper, operating marked MSP vehicle V-27, and conducting routine patrol when I was dispatched to a report of a single vehicle collision, with a pickup truck off the roadway and in a ditch. I arrived on-scene at northbound Worcester Highway (U.S. Route 113) near Carey Road, Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland and observed a tan colored GMC Sierra pickup truck off the right side of the roadway and down in a ditch at the tree line. I activated my emergency lights and pulled behind the vehicle on the shoulder. I exited my patrol car and made contact with the operator and sole occupant of the truck. The truck was still running with the keys in the ignition and lights on.   PHASE TWO - PERSONAL CONTACT:    Upon my initial contact with the operator, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the truck. I asked if he was ok, he just stated that he thought the truck was pretty stuck. I asked him for his drivers license, he searched for it briefly but could not locate it, though he eventually identified himself as James Douglas Willey Jr, DOB 10/11/2001 with a Hotel Road address. While speaking with him, I noticed that his eyes were glassy and bloodshot, and his speech was slow, lethargic and slurred. Additionally, I noted that his movements were lethargic as well.Willey eventually turned keys and turned off the truck.    I asked Willey if he had drank any alcoholic beverages that night, he stated Umm, I probably had like three maybe three and a half beers worth. When I asked him what he was drinking, he added, I was drinking umm, Natural BOH, Natty BOH. Next I asked him where he had been drinking and how long he had been there, Willey replied, It was at Sterling Tavern. I inquired about when he was drinking and when he finished, his response was, I was probably there about like uh, two and a half, three hours. It was probably eleven thirty to around twelve oclock. Somewhere between there. Im not exact on the time, but it was between twelve thirty and one oclock. These questions were asked around 2340 hours, showing he did not have an accurate tracking of time.     Eventually, I asked Willey to exit the truck and speak with me outside. He complied and spoke to me in front of my patrol vehicle. Two Worcester County Deputies had arrived to assist me.  PHASE THREE - PRE ARREST SCREENING:    While speaking with Willey outside I observed his eyes were still bloodshot, and glassy. His speech was still slurred and movements still lethargic. He was wearing a long sleeve shirt, long work pants, and work boots. He appeared fit, and uninjured.  Screening Questions:   Medications taken?     No medications taken.    Medical conditions?     He stated that he was told he may have ADHD, however he is not prescribed any medications or treatments for it.    Injuries?     None.  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs):    The SFSTs were performed in front of my patrol vehicle, all front-facing emergency lights were deactivated to prevent optokinetic nystagmus. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. The area was well lit by my headlights, flashlight, and overhead streetlights. The weather was clear and calm.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS:6 of 6 clueswere observed    1. Willey displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.   2. Willey displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes.   3. Willey displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.   WALK AND TURN: 6 of 8 clueswere observed    1. Willey could not maintain his balance during the Instructional Phase as his feet broke apart from the instructed and demonstrated position.    2. Willey began walking before being instructed to do so, and took several attempts to get him to stop walking.    3. Willey raised his arms more than 6 inches from his sides beginning at step 5, and kept them raised through most of the test.    4. Willey stepped off-line by a foots width on step 8 of his first 9, and steps 2, 4, 6, and 8 on his second 9.    5. Willey took the wrong number of steps, taking 10 steps on his first 9, and 10 on his second 9.    6. Willey did not complete the turn properly, as he did not keep his lead foot planted on the ground and stepped with both feet to turn around.    ONE LEG STAND: 2 of 4 clueswere observed   1. Willey swayed from side to side and forward and backwards throughout the test.    2. Willey hopped at 28 seconds.   PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST:     I offered Willey the preliminary breath test, which he refused to take.    OBSERVATIONS / INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT: 1. Vehicle ran off of right side of road and got stuck without good explanation. 2. Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. 3. Glassy, bloodshot eyes. 4. Slurred speech. 5. Lethargic movements. 6. Admitted to consuming multiple alcoholic beverages recently. 7. Inaccurate time keeping. 5. HGN: 6 of 6 clues 6. WAT: 6 of 8 clues 7. OLS: 2 of 4 clues  THE ARREST:   Due to my observations, and the results of the above tests, I believed Willey to be under the influence of alcohol and unable to safely operate a motor vehicle. I placed him under arrest for DUI at 0001 hours on 4/20/23. In my patrol vehicle I played Willey the MVAs DR-15 Advice of Rights form in English from the MVAs website. At its conclusion, Willey agreed to chemical breath testing at 0019 hours. I transported Willey to the Berlin Barrack.  CHEMICAL BREATH TESTING:   Willey remained under direct observation for at least 20 minutes prior to the chemical breath testing. Corporal Snell #6191 conducted the chemical breath testing utilizing the Intoximeter ER/IR II at 0044 hours. The breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .16 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  DISPOSITION:   Willey was issued all appropriate citations and provided copies of all pertinent documents. He was then release from the barrack to his girlfriend.  All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
