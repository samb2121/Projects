         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car and body camera Defendant: Trina Rolaanda Minor  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (March 2013 SFST NHTSA Manual). * I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of February 2016. * I am a Certified Breath Test Operator by the Toxicologist of the State of Maryland as of March 2016. * I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of March 2016. * I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of June 2015 * I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of May 2014. * I am a Preliminary Breath Test Instructor as of May 2019. * I am a RADAR and LIDAR Instructor as of October 2019. * I have apprehended more than 1,100 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On October 8, 2023 at approximately 0225 hours, I (Cpl. Wallace #6323) was on patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-1 on northbound Dulaney Valley prior to 695, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a black Nissan passenger vehicle bearing Maryland registration 9FE1190 traveling in front of my patrol vehicle. The Nissan was swerving left and right over the dotted white line. The Nissan swerved right over solid white as if it was going to take the I/L, jerked left and continued north. The Nissan swerved right and straddled the dotted white line, then left. The Nissan accelerated away from my patrol vehicle at what appeared to be above the posted 40 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar (S/N: EG-02387), which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 74 MPH in a posted 40 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly).The Nissan swerved right onto the dotted white line, then left. I activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop on the Nissan prior to Seminary Ave.   The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. Training certificates and calibration records will be made available upon request. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Nissan on the driver side and made contact with the female operator of the vehicle, who was the only occupant in the vehicle. I explained the reason for the stop and requested her drivers license. She stated oh wow when I said her speed. She was identified by her Maryland drivers license asTrina Rolaanda Minor.While speaking with Minor, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the interior of the vehicle. She continued to look forward. When she looked in my direction, I deliberately observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I returned to my patrol vehicle and notified the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Nissan and requested Minor to exit her vehicle. She complied and exited her vehicle. She had difficulty opening the door. As I communicated with Minor outside of the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. When asked about alcohol consumption she stated like wine, I gotta poop. She stated she had a glass of wine and a bottle of sangria. I informed Minor that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which she agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed at the location of the stop.  I asked Minor the following questions:  Glasses or Contact  Contacts Recent head injuries  No Medication  Blood pressure medication Problems with knees or ankles  No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting Nystagmus    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes     Moved head when instructed to keep her head still.   She continued to tell me that she needed to use the bathroom.   WALK AND TURN (8/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed.  Instructional Stage:    Lost balance stepped completely offline to the right 1 time.  Attempted to begin the test prior to being instructed.      She stated that she could call her State Trooper friend to come get her.   Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Stepped completely offline on step 1.  Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 3-8.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from side for balance.  Took 8 steps when instructed to take 9.  Turn: Turned left both feet 90 degrees  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Stopped the test and had to be instructed to continue.  Missed touching heel to toe by more than  inch on steps 1-9.  Stepped completely offline on steps 1 and 2.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from side for balance.   ONE LEG STAND(3/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Balance and Count Stage:    She could not keep her foot off the ground. Right foot hit the ground  Swayed side to side.  Raised arms more than 6 inches from side for balance.    PBT #209455 with a result of .12 BrAC.    She had peed herself  ARREST Due to the number of observations, I concluded Minor was driving under the influence and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0241 hours, I placed Minor under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Minor was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Baltimore County Towson Precinct for processing. Once at the station she was given the opportunity to use the bathroom, since she continued to tell me that she had to go to the bathroom. She went into the bathroom and immediately exited. She stated that she was not going to go to the bathroom.  Upon arrival at the station, I provided Minor with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Minor listened to the DR-15 Advice of Rights from the MVA website. At 0309 hours, Minor refused to take a breath test.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: Not applicable  INTOXIMETER RESULT: ****Refusal****  Minor was polite and cooperative, she was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.  </NarrativeText>
