         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>All events were captured on my Body- Worn Camera (BWC)  Scene Processing:Due to the nature of the incident, no scene processing was conducted.   Narrative: On May 24th, 2023, at approximately 0939 hours, I, Tpr. Richards #7514 was dispatched to assist the St. Marys County Sheriffs Office with a disturbance related to a homicide/ shooting that occurred earlier this morning. I was dispatched to the Charlott Hall Farmers Market located, 29890 Three Notch Rd, Charlotte Hall, MD 20622. Upon arrival, I observed a large crowd along with deputies speaking with the suspect. Upon exiting my vehicle, I observed several St. Marys County Sheriffs Office Deputies attempting to apprehend a combative suspect who was possibly involved with the earlier homicide/ shooting investigation. I proceeded to run towards their location to provide assistance. Upon arriving to their location, the suspect later identified as, David Harold Johnson III (DOB: 09/16/1990) was actively resisting St. Marys County Deputies while yelling in an aggressive and irate manner. I assisted the deputies by gaining control of Johnsons left arm with my left hand and his left wrist with my right hand. The SMCSO Deputies were giving clear and lawful orders for Johnson to stop resisting and place his hands behind his back. Johnson continued his resistance by failing to comply and by yelling aggressively stating Bitch ass niggas, both of yall, yall cant do nothing with me, Id fuck every single one of yall up. Johnson was subsequently secured and arrested, myself and Deputy Teague assisted Johnson to his feet, so he could stand and walk under his own power. Once on his own feet, Johnson continued to yell in law enforcement personnel faces in an aggressive and threatening manner. While escorting Johnson towards a marked St. Marys County Deputys vehicle, Johnson looked at me and began yelling aggressively You upholding this shit, you with this shit right? Fucking pussy ass nigga. While Deputy Teague was attempting to conduct a search of Johnson, he continued to yell in an aggressive and irate manner and was actively resisting by moving around preventing Deputy Teague from conducting a proper search. Deputy Teague maintained a control technique of Johnsons wrist while conducting his search, to prevent Johnson from continuing to resist by pushing back and yelling obscenities. Deputy Teague then placed Johnson in the rear caged compartment of his patrol vehicle. While being secured in the patrol vehicle, Johnson made statements regarding Deputy Teagues Body-Worn camera. Johnson stated I dont give a fuck. Im supposed to be audio and visually recorded with that motherfucking body cam you got on. Johnson was secured in the SMCSO vehicle, and no further force was used at this time. Additionally, at this time Johnson did not complain of or report any injuries nor were any visible signs of injuries observed.  Deputy Teague transported Johnson to Chronic Ink for further investigation being conducted by the St. Marys County Sheriffs Office.TFC Posch #6749 and I, responded to Chronic Ink in an attempt to take photographs of Johnson. No injuries were observed or reported. Photographs of Johnson were not taken as he was acting belligerent an uncooperative. TFC Posch attempted to speak with Johnson while seated in the SMCSO vehicle. Johnson advised he did not want any photographs taken of him and did not want to cooperate with the use of force investigation. Johnson remained in the custody of the SMCSO for further investigation.  Refer to TFC Poschs supplement regarding his part in this incident. . All of the above events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on body-worn camera/in-car camera (T-30).  Narrative:  On 05/24/2023 at approximately 0939 hours, Deputies with the St. Marys County Sheriffs officer requested additional officers respond to 29890 Three Notch Road, St. Marys County, Maryland, 20622. The deputies advised they had two related ongoing incidents involving a homicide. They advised the suspect and victims family were beginning to fight outside of Chronic Ink located at 29025 Three Notch Road, Mechanicsville, St. Marys County, Maryland, 20659. They also advised a deputy was out with a suspect at 29890 Three Notch Road, St. Marys County, Maryland, 20622, and initially was not answering the radio. Upon my arrival on scene, I observed Tpr. Richards # 7514 and Deputy Teague #249 over top of the combative suspect, David Harold Johnson 3rd (B/M DOB: 09/16/1990) placing him in handcuffs. Upon exiting my vehicle, Mr. Johnson was extremely verbally combative against officers, and became physically combative pulling away from and pushing into officers while in handcuffs. Verbal commands were constantly being given by Deputy Teague to stop resisting. Tpr. Richards and Deputy Teague escorted Mr. Johnson to the front of a patrol vehicle while Mr. Johnson was actively resisting and pulling away. Mr. Johnson was placed against the hood of a vehicle for a search incident to arrest to be completed. I secured Mr. Johnsons right side by holding his bicep, so Deputy Teague could complete the search. Mr. Johnson was continually being verbally aggressive and pulling away while being searched. Mr. Johnson was secured in a Sheriffs Office vehicle. While inside of the vehicle, Mr. Johnson began striking the door with his body.   Mr. Johnson was returned to the homicide scene at Chronic Ink. I then responded to Chronic Ink, where due to manpower constraints, I attempted to photograph Mr. Johnson and ascertain if he had any injuries. When advised of my reason for speaking to him, Mr. Johnson advised he would not allow any photos to be taken of him by me or my supervisor and he was invoking my fifth amendment right. Mr. Johnson Turned and faced away from me. I did not observe any injuries to Mr. Johnson, he did not complain of any injuries, and he did not request any medical treatment. All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
