         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack N Marked MSP vehicle N-17 In-Car and BWC Operational   Defendant: Delmi Zucely Sanchez Juarez  Date of Birth: 12/14/1997  Date of Arrest: 03/12/2023  Time of Arrest: 0029 hours  DUI #: 23-069 (Rockville Barrack)   CERTIFICATION  TRAINING * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement through the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 03/12/2023 at approximately 0012 hours, I TFC Satterfield #7216,was patrolling westbound I-495 in the area of Connecticut Ave. I noticed a Gray Nissan Sentra bearing Maryland registration 7ER7426 traveling at a high rate of speed and unable to maintain proper lane discipline. I activated my emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the driver identified as Delmi Zucely Sanchez Juarez (H/F DOB 12/14/1997) by her Maryland Drivers license. I approached the vehicle to speak with the driver and immediately smelled a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from Sanchez Juarezs breath and vehicle.I asked Sanchez Juarez where she was coming from, if she had anything to drink, and where she was headed. Sanchez Juarez advised that she had 4-5 mixed drinks at her boyfriends house in Glenmont with her last drink being approximately forty minutes before driving home. As I continued to speak with Sanchez Juarez, I smelled the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and noticed her eyes were bloodshot and glossy. A bottle of Hennessy that was approximately 3/4 empty was also located on the front passengers side floor of Sanchez Juarezs car. I asked Sanchez Juarez if she would consent to perform standardized field sobriety tests to determine if she was okay to drive to which she agreed to.  PRE- ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of the Outer Loop of I-495 at Connecticut Ave. The surface was dry and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, and my flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Sanchez Juarez did not display any visible injuries. All the SFST were demonstrated to Sanchez Juarez before herattempts. Sanchez Juarez stated she had no injuries or physical impairment that would prevent herfrom completing the tests.  I asked the following questions: Medical Conditions  No Injuries  No Medication  None  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 CLUES) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. My fingertip was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Sanchez Juarezs eyes. Sanchez Juarez was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping herhead still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with hereyes until told to stop. Sanchez Juarezs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. I asked Sanchez Juarez if she understood the directions, and she stated that she did.Sanchez Juarez was positioned away from passing traffic to ensure the results of the HGN test were not compromised.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) Prior to Sanchez Juarez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Sanchez Juarez was instructed to place herright foot directly in front of herleft foot and touch heel to toe. Sanchez Juarez was instructed to place herhands flat at herside and to remain in the position until told to begin. Sanchez Juarez was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Sanchez Juarez was to keep herhands flat at herside, keep hereyes focused on herfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Sanchez Juarez was demonstrated and explained to keep herlead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with herrear foot to turn completely around. Sanchez Juarez was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Sanchez Juarez was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep herhands down by herside, look down at herfeet, and count each step out loud. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Sanchez Juarez if she completely understood the instructions to which sheadvised she did.  Instructional Stage: Sanchez Juarez could not keep balance in the instructional stage and broke heel to toe contact.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on every step 2.) Stopped walking after step 9  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): 1.) Missed heel to toe on every step  Turn: Sanchez Juarez completed the turn improperly. She did not take a series of small steps to turn around but instead just spread her arms and spun around.  ONE LEG STAND (1/4 CLUES) Prior to Sanchez Juarez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Sanchez Juarez was instructed to stand with herheels together and hands down by hersides while the instructions were given and during the test. Sanchez Juarez was instructed not to begin the test until she was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of herchoice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While herleg was raised she was to keep herleg straight, watch herraised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Sanchez was asked if she understood the test and the instructions to which she advised she did.  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Put foot down multiple times (Foot never off ground for more than one second)  Seconds 11-20: 1.) Put foot down multiple times.(Foot never off ground for more than one second)  Seconds 21-30 1.) Put foot down multiple times(Foot never off ground for more than one second)  Sanchez Juarez refused to submit to apreliminarybreath test.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believe Sanchez Juarez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from breath. * Glassy and bloodshot eyes * Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages. * Unable to drive in a single lane * My observed signs of impairment as she performed field sobriety tests  I arrested Sanchez Juarez for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0029 hours and she was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack for processing. At the barrack, I gave Sanchez Juarez a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to follow along as she listened to the audio form being read to herin its entirety. At the conclusion of the form, Sanchez Juarez agreed to submit to the intoximeter test and signed the DR-15 indicating the same (0054 hours).The test was performed by SGT Saucerman #4873 of the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack.  INTOXIMETER RESULT .18 BAC  Sanchez Juarezwas issued the appropriate paperwork and I transported her to her home address. All events occurred in MontgomeryCounty, State of Maryland.
