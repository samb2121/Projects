         <NarrativeText>This incident was recorded on an in-car and body-worn camera system (H-13).  Driver: Ginwright, Stephon Andre (DOB: 06/22/1995).  Traffic Violations: TA 21-201 (a1)  Driver failure to obey properly placed traffic control device (2SY0T54). TA 21-902(a1i)  Driving under the influence of alcohol (2SZ0T54). TA 21-902(B1i)-Driving while impaired by alcohol (2T00T54). TA 21-901.1 (b)  Negligent driving (2T10T54).  NARRATIVE:    On Saturday, April 15, 2023, at approximately 0025 hours, I, TFC Foster #6937 while operating unmarked patrol vehicle H-13, was working patrol in the area of northbound Route 301 (Crain Highway) north of Acton Lane, Waldorf, Charles County, MD 20601. While patrolling, a simulcast was dispatched for a vehicle lookout. The lookout was for a silver Ford Mustang driving erratically, almost striking other vehicles. Immediately after the lookout was dispatched, I observed a silver Ford Mustang bearing MD 9ER5147 ahead of my patrol vehicle in lane two, in the area of northbound Route 301 south of Substation Road. I confirmed it was the same vehicle from the lookout that was provided. The Ford stopped at the steady red circular signal at the intersection of Route 301 and Substation Road in lane two. The traffic light turned green and, as the Ford proceeded through the intersection it began to veer into lane three almost striking a tractor-trailer. The Ford continued traveling with its two passengers side tires in lane three, approximately one foot from the trailer of the tractor trailer, for approximately 75 feet. I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle just south of Mattawoman Drive. The Ford then changed lanes into lane one and continued through the intersection of Mattawoman Drive and proceeded toward the intersection of Mattawoman Beantown Road. At the traffic light at Mattawoman Beantown Road, where the only method of travel is to continue northbound while the southbound side of Route 301 has only a traffic signal for turning off of Route 301, and proceeded to perform a u-turn against oncoming traffic, and parked on the right shoulder of southbound Route 301.    I made contact with the driver, the sole occupant of the vehicle, and stated the reason for the traffic stop. I instructed the driver to retrieve his license and registration, which he complied with. I was able to identify the driver by his MD drivers license as Ginwright, Stephon Andre (DOB: 06/22/1995). I asked Ginwright where he was coming from and he pointed to his license and said, Thats all you need. While speaking with Ginwright, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. Ginwright was wearing a camouflage bucket hat, he was slouched down in his seat, and avoiding any eye contact with me. I instructed Ginwright to exit his vehicle and walk towards the front of it. Ginwright replied for what reason? I advised Ginwright again to exit his vehicle, to which he replied, No. For what reason? I, again, advised Ginwright to exit his vehicle and he replied, No. I continued to advise Ginwright that I was giving him a lawful order to exit his vehicle and he interrupted me, saying, You work for me, so Im asking for what reason? Ginwright continued, I pay your taxes. I explained to Ginwright, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, and that I intended to conduct standardized field sobriety tests. Throughout our conversation, I was forced to have Ginwright repeat himself multiple times because he was mumbling and his speech was low and slow. Ginwright then complied and exited his vehicle. While exiting his vehicle, Ginwright did so, slowly, and used the vehicle door for balance.     While outside his vehicle, Ginwright stood next to the rear drivers side tire. I instructed him to move to the front of his vehicle, as it would be a safer location. Ginwright responded, saying, You already have me for what you pulled me over for. I, again, asked Ginwright to move toward the front of his vehicle and, again, Ginwright replied, You already have me for what you pulled me over for. I explained to Ginwright again, why I was instructing him to move to the front of the vehicle. Ginwright refused and stated, Im not taking no field tests. I attempted to clarify with Ginwright and he advised, again, Im not taking no field tests. While speaking with Ginwright outside of his vehicle, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath.    Ginwright ultimately refused all standardized field sobriety tests. Ginwright was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0032 hours. Ginwright then asked Am I being pulled over because of the bar I was coming from? Ginwright was transported to the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack for further processing. While at the Barrack, he was advised of his DR-15, Advice of Rights, at 0111 hours. Ginwright refused to submit to an intoximeter testat that time.  Ginwright was transported to the Charles County Detention Center for further processing. While at the detention center, Ginwright was issued several citations related to the traffic stop.  Ginwright was very argumentative and uncooperative prior to his arrest; however, while in custody, he became far more cooperative, talkative, and respectful.  The Ford was towed from the scene by Riverside Towing and taken to their tow lot.  All events occurred in Charles County, MD.  Case Closed. </NarrativeText>
