         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> On April 20, 2023, I, TFC Mingos, from the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region (CEDER) were assigned a NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) cybertip number 160686135 for investigation. The cybertip was submitted by the online social media provider Dropbox, Inc.   Dropbox, Inc. reported between April 18, 2023 at 17:54:44 UTC and April 20, 2023 at 22:32:15 UTC, a user of their platform uploaded a video of suspected child pornography to their network. I reviewed the video and confirmed it to be child pornography.  Video Description: I observed the video to be 1 minute and 21 seconds in run time. The video depicts a prepubescent unidentified male around the approximate age of 10 years old with a black mask on covering his face except for his mouth. The video depicts the prepubescent males hands bound behind his back. In the video is an adult male with an erect penis. The male is shown with his left hand behind the prepubescent head forcing the child to perform oral sex. The next scene of the video shows the prepubescent child laying on his stomach with his knees spread outwardly with his arms and hands pinned underneath his body. The prepubescent child is then penetrated by the adult males erect penis from behind in the anus. At the end of the video, the adult male ejaculates in the prepubescent childs anus and shows the ejaculate pouring out of the childs anus.   Video File Name: C40217C3-D49B-4AB4-AAF1-BE37E296318C  Suspect account information reported by Dropbox, Inc. is documented below:  Email Address: jonathan01joseph@gmail.com (Verified 06-01-2022 16:22:39 UTC) Screen/User Name: Jonathan Joseph ESP User ID: 1269188785   The IP address, 174.251.64.120, last used to log in to Dropbox, Inc. was found to be through Verizon on April 18, 2023 at 17:54:44 UTC. Several other log ins to Dropbox were used and they came back to Comcast. The last login referencing Comcast IP address, 2601:142:c100:1ad0:5486:aa77:b4e0:b231,was on February 28, 2023 at 06:54:29 UTC. A subpoena was served on Comcast and Verizon to obtain subscriber information. Preliminarily, the IP address geolocates to Dorchester County, Maryland.   I will be executing a search warrant on Dropbox, Inc. to obtain additional information for the target account and better identify the suspect.   Case remains open pending records. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Jonathan Joseph (suspect) Interview</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  On June 7, 2023, at 0926 hours, I, TFC Mingos, arrived at the Royal Farms located at 331 Bloomingdale Ave, Federalsburg, MD 21632, and made contact with Jonathan Joseph (DOB: 07/07/2000), [hereinafter referred to as Joseph] in reference to an interview. The following interview took place in my unmarked covert vehicle with Sgt. Antal present. The interview was audibly recorded and is documented below:  Interview: Jonathan Joseph:   I began to explain the cybertip(s) to Joseph and how they generate.  I asked Joseph about the email address,  text-decoration:underline"&gt;jonathan01joseph@gmail.com, in which Joseph responded, thats my personal email.  I asked Joseph if Dropbox username, Jonathan Joseph, was his account. Joseph stated he does not use Dropbox anymore.  Joseph advised someone else used his Dropbox account but does not know who. Joseph stated he has been getting hacked lately.  Joseph stated he changed his password and has been banned by and from Dropbox multiple times.  Joseph stated he has not had Dropbox for weeks.  I advised Joseph I conducted a search warrant for his Dropbox account and could see all of his content. I advised Joseph I went into his content folder labeled Household Fucker and observed the child pornography video Dropbox flagged and sent to NCMEC.  I explained the video flagged by Dropbox and asked Joseph if he remembered that video.  Joseph stated, I dont remember.  I asked Joseph about the other approximate 40 videos and images of child pornography that were contained in his Dropbox content.  Joseph stated, someone was sending them to me.  Joseph stated he does not remember and that his brother, Godson, caught him on his phone looking at child pornography.Godson was going to take his phone away and told him to be careful what is kept on his phone.  Joseph stated he lied to his brother about the images and videos because he was nervous and someone was sending them to him.  I asked Joseph how he retrieved the images and put them on his Dropbox account.  Joseph stated, I saved them.  Joseph stated he went on different websites to get the images to save to Dropbox.  Joseph stated he has received images and videos off of Discord.  Joseph stated he only sends streaks on his Snapchat account.  Joseph stated he has never sent images on Snapchat of child pornography to other people.  I began to explain the Discord Cybetip received from NCMEC and asked Joseph to verify his account information. Joseph advised the username, Joe2022#6241, and email address,  text-decoration:underline"&gt;Jonathan01joseph@gmail.com, was his account.  Joseph advised his Discord account got banned.  I advised Joseph when child pornography is uploaded utilizing these platforms, the platform used to upload the child pornography will band the account.  Joseph stated he created a new account and wants to be safe so the account does not get banned anymore.  I proceeded to show a snapshot of the child victims face of the Cybertip image from Discord to Joseph.  Joseph stated he remembers the image and that somebody sent that image to him.  Joseph stated he believes he was on an app called Minga. Joseph stated, People be sending me links and I click it, and I didnt expect to see all the images. Then after I told the person to stop sending it to me, and I got called a cocksucker.  Joseph stated he then cussed the person out and that person may have reported him.  I clarified the cybertip again to Joseph and how it works.  I advised Joseph the images and videos I observed were between the ages of 4 to 12-year-old boys who were in a sexual arousal state. I asked Joseph, Is that what you are attracted to?  Joseph stated, No, because my brother warned me to be careful and Im going to listen to him. And whatever is on my phone, Im going to see what I have, and remove.  I asked Joseph, Can I could see your phone?  Joseph proceeded to provide his cell phone in which he identified as an iPhone XR. Joseph stated his brother recently gave that phone to him in May, 2023.  I advised Joseph that I have probable cause to believe there is child pornography on his phone and I am going to seize it pending a search warrant.  I asked Joseph, Is there any child pornography on your phone?  Joseph stated, I dont want to get into trouble.  I advised Joseph he does not have to tell me anything and this is a voluntary interview.  I asked Joseph, Have you ever been hands on with a child? Sexually?  Joseph stated, No.  Joseph stated he has another app he uses called Signal.  I asked Joseph, What is on there?  Joseph stated, Can I whisper it to you? Joseph leaned in next to my ear and stated, bad stuff.  Joseph stated the Signal app is a little slow and it freezes and he uses it on his phone. Joseph stated somebody sent him a link on Discord App and he clicked on it.  I asked Joseph, What did you see when you clicked on the link.  Joseph stated, The same things you told me.  I stated, So the same things on your Dropbox?  Joseph stated, yeah.  Joseph stated he clicked on the link because he thought it was a group thing that had the same interest as him.  I advised Joseph that based on the images and videos reviewed on his Dropbox, I could tell his sexual attraction was off boys between the ages of 5 and 11. I asked Joseph. That is what you are sexually attracted too, right?  Joseph stated, Not no more.  I asked Joseph, But you were?  Joseph stated, I were, yeah.   I asked Joseph, When did this sexual attraction start?  Joseph stated, On my old phone. It is messed up and does not charge.  I asked Joseph, What age were you when you became sexually attracted to children in that age range?  Joseph stated, I believe it was age 20.  Joseph stated he stopped being sexually attracted to children this year because his brother told him to stop.  Joseph stated he has a friend on Snapchat he met and he is a 15-year-old boy. Joseph stated they are friends and not sexual partners.  I asked Joseph, Is your friend into this stuff to?  Joseph stated, No, he has a girlfriend.  I asked Joseph, Do you get sexual gratification to those images and videos on Dropbox? Do you masturbate to those?  Joseph stated, Not anymore.  I asked Joseph, But you used to?  Joseph stated, yeah.  I asked Joseph if he needs help with his addiction.  Joseph stated people would pick on him and if he became angry he would look at child pornography to relax him but now he does not do that anymore and just watches YouTube.  I asked Joseph if he believes he has a problem and needs counseling reference child pornography.  Joseph stated he was seeing a counselorin Baltimore where he went to college but he did not talk about child pornography with the counselor.  Joseph stated he needs someone to help him make sure he does not have any bad apps.  Joseph said when he gets his phone back he is going to delete those apps.  Joseph stated he does not want to go to court and was worried about when he was getting his phone back.  Joseph stated, A person named Sha Sha has been sending me pictures of his stuff, and he does heroin.  I asked Joseph, Have you met him before? Does he live in Maryland?  Joseph stated, No, he lives out of state.  I asked joseph, Do you talk to any other kids or meet up with any other kids?  Joseph stated, No. I only talk to one person named Jerry Thompson. We send streaks and I send him streaks and photos of me being fresh.  Joseph stated he does not send child pornography to Jerry nor does Jerry send anything to him.  Joseph stated he uses the app Signal, Twitter, and Snapchat.  I asked Joseph, Is there child porn on twitter?  Joseph stated, No.  Joseph stated his old phone was an iPhone 6 Plus and got it on 2020 at Christmas Eve.  Joseph stated he wanted to clear his mind and was going to tell me the truth. Joseph stated he had somebody on Snapchat with middle name of Michael who was texting him [Joseph] to send him [Michael] Child pornography videos. Joseph stated, I did, and Im sorry about that.

         <NarrativeTitle>CELL PHONE DATA</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> JOSEPH CELL PHONE DATA   On June 8, 2023, I, TFC Mingos, obtained a search warrant for Josephs cell phone identified as a Yellow iPhone Xr serial # F4GY70T6KXKR w/ IMEI: 35 305310 286332 3. The cell phone was transported to the Talbot County Sheriffs Office Criminal Investigations Division on June 8, 2023. The cell phones data was forensically extracted by CPL Faggert #0155 on June 19, 2023.   On June 20, 2023, I retrieved the cell phone and the extracted data from CPL Faggert #0155 from the Talbot County Sheriffs Office and transported it back to the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack for review of the data.   Upon review of the data, I observed thirty-three (33) videos and thirty-five (35) pictures portraying Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). Most of the videos and pictures were of pre-pubescent male children, most in a sexual aroused state, masturbating and/or being penetrated by another males penis. The location of these files were located in Media, pictures and videos. The pre-pubescent childrens age range depicted in the images and videos was from approximately 3 to 12.   Upon review of the communication section of the cell phone, child pornography was being exchanged and viewed in chat rooms utilizing social media platform WhatsApp and Viber Messages.   The extracted phone data will be kept with the main investigator and original case file. </NarrativeText>
