         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 2/9/23 at approximately 1416 hours I was dispatched to 13300 Ours Lane NE, Cumberland, MD for a report of an unattended death. Upon my arrival, I made contact with Colby Santmiyer, Paramedic with Bedford Road VFD, who advised that they were called for an unconscious unresponsive individual. When they arrived at the residence, they found James Pugh, deceased on the kitchen floor, with clear signs of lividity and full rigor mortis. Based on these observations, they did not perform life-saving measures and the time of death was listed at 1416 hours. Santmiyer contacted the 911 center and requested law enforcement to respond for an unattended death investigation.  Santmiyer was able to provide a few details about Pugh that assisted in the investigation. He advised that Pugh has a pacemaker, hypertension, a thyroid removed and went to wound care at UPMC for issues with his legs leaking fluid. He advised that Pugh was on medication, but they were unable to locate any in the kitchen area where his body was located. On the table was a list of medications and doses Pugh was supposed to be taking daily. On that list were the following medications: Levothyroxine 88, Carvedilol 12, Elquis 2.5, and Vitamen D3 all to be taken 1 daily, Torsemide 20 and Potassium CL 10 were to be taken 2 times daily. A search of the house revealed no medication in the house under any of those names listed on the card. Janet Morgan, witness and neighbor, advised that she just found out that his primary care physician, Dr. Kandara, would not refill his prescriptions until Pugh had the proper blood work completed. Morgan advised that this could be the reason Pugh did not have those medications in the residence, and she took him on 2/8/23 to have that blood work completed.  After speaking with Santmiyer, I continued to speak with Morgan, who advised that last week Pugh was out in the driveway and attempted to walk up the grass and slipped and fell in the driveway and was laying on the asphalt yelling for help. When she walked out she heard him yelling and went over and got help to get him up. She advised that when he fell, he hit his face and busted his nose, and it was bleeding pretty badly and had a pool of blood around Pughs head while he laid there. Morgan was unable to provide a time frame for how long Pugh had laid in the driveway before getting him up. She did state that Pugh stated that he felt find and went inside his house and was able to take care of himself, after he was helped up off the ground. She stated that he did have blood spots on the kitchen floor from where he was walking to get a paper towel to help catch the blood. I located the spots of blood on the kitchen floor that were a dark brown from being old blood stains on the floor. A check of the area around Pugh revealed no new blood stains from his fall leading to his death.  The internal temperature of the house was 75 degrees and Pugh was wearing a long sleeve orange shirt with blue pants, a black belt and wraps around both his feet to help with swelling from his skin issues on his lower legs. Inside his pockets were a set of car keys, and several white napkins. He was wearing a wristwatch on his left wrist and hand several band-aids on the left hand from cuts he sustained in the fall. Pugh had two black eyes, which Morgan advised were from the fall that he took outside, due to hitting his nose on the asphalt. Everything in the residence was neat and tidy and no foul play was detected. The front and rear doors were secured and only unlocked by Morgan, due to having a key to access the house for the paramedics when they arrived on the scene. Pughs cell phone was located in the living room on the end table next to the recliner, and was fully charged. I was able to access the phone to get the name of his primary care doctor, because that is where Morgan stated that he maintained all his doctors information.  Pamela Burkett, Medical Examiner, was contacted and provided all the above listed information. She then contacted the Chief Medical Examiners Office in Baltimore, Maryland, where it was determined that and autopsy would be completed on Pugh, due to him having a fall the week prior. Burkett provided the OCME case number, 23-01894, and responded to the scene to process the body for OCME. Heart Felt was contacted from Washington County, Maryland to respond to the scene and transport the body to Baltimore to have the autopsy completed.  Trooper Rishell, Maryland State Police Hagerstown Barrack responded to 13621 Dixie Drive, Hagerstown, MD, to make contact with Teresa Pugh, daughter or Glenda Pugh, ex wife, due to them being the only next of kin known. Contact was made with Glenda and Trp. Rishell provided all the necessary information to her about Pughs death. An MSP 89B was completed and emailed to the OCMEs office and to MSP homicide unit per the Maryland State Police policy. The 89B was also attached to the report and pictures were uploaded to the report and Digital Evidence Veripic site.  I request that this case remain open, pending the OCME report from the autopsy.</NarrativeText>
