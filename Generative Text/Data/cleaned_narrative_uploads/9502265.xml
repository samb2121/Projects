Narrative:  On October 6, 2023, at approximately 2118 hours, the Calvert County Emergency Control Center broadcasted a call for a report of a domestic dispute involving a firearm at, 610 Quiver Ct, Lusby, MD 20657. The Emergency Control Center (ECC) advised a text message was sent to 911 advising the father of the complainants kids was intoxicated and pulled out a firearm. The complainant also advised the father of her kids was yelling at her. The complainant later advised the firearm was sitting next to male subject.    I, Trooper Hernandez #7266, responded to the residence immediately after the call was broadcasted. Prior to Quiver Ct, I parked my vehicle and waited for back-up. While I was waiting, the complainant advised the ECC that the male subject was locked outside the residence, and she was inside the residence. The complainant advised the firearm was inside the residence as well.    A few moments later, my back-up arrived, and we responded to the scene at the residence. Upon arrival, I immediately observed a black male outside the residence. The male subject was not wearing a shirt, and he was knocking and banging on the door. The male subject was yelling towards the residence asking to let him inside the residence. The male subject appeared to be angry.The male subject was later identified as, Dwight Nathaniel White III (B/M DOB: 10/04/1985). White was extremely argumentative, and was extremely upset that I responded to his residence. White advised he was in an argument with his wife, but did not need the police to get involved. I asked White if he could elaborate on what had occurred, but he advised he was not going to talk. I told White I needed to speak to the female subject, so I asked White to move away from the residence. White did not listen to my instructions. I walked towards the residence, next to White, and detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. Whites eyes were bloodshot red, and he appeared to be intoxicated. I walked inside the residence with Trooper Sivic, while S/T Rucker and TFC Bauer remained outside with White.  I walked inside the residence and made contact with the involved female, who was later identified as, Katina Annette Harkins (B/F DOB: 01/12/1987). Harkins was carrying her daughter, Nyrobe White (05/14/2023) when I made contact with her. I tried talking to her near the front door of the residence, but there were several dogs at the residence who were all barking. I asked Harkins if we could talk somewhere that was quiet. Harkins escorted me to her room, which is where the incident occurred. Upon entering the room, Harkins pointed towards a gun, and advised that was the gun that was pulled out by White. The gun was laying on a black table in plain view. I unloaded the gun for safety reasons. The gun was later found to be a Beretta Px4 Storm (S/N: PZ69172). The Beretta had a magazine inside the magazine well, but there were no rounds in the chamber. The magazine was loaded with 10 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition.  While I was unloading the Beretta, Harkins advised the handgun was not registered. I asked Harkins who the Beretta belonged to, and she advised it was Whites gun. Harkins stated there was an additional handgun somewhere inside the residence that was unregistered. I asked Harkins if she knew where it was, and she advised that the second handgun was usually in a blue case inside the closet of the room where she was staying.  After dealing with the Beretta, I proceeded to speak to Harkins regarding the incident.Harkins advised she was involved in a verbal argument with White. Harkins advised she has been involved in ongoing domestic issues and arguments with White. Harkins stated the argument started when White came home drunk, and found out that Harkins called the mother of one of Whites daughters. Harkins advised there were three daughters at the residence, but one of the daughters was her step-daughter. The step-daughter was identified as, Jasyah Renae Nayef Durham (B/F DOB 01/22/2010). Harkins advised she called Durhams mother, so she could pick her up from the residence. Harkins advised she was tired of having all the children listen to the arguments they were having, and thought it would be best if Durham went with her biological mother. Harkins also stated that Durham was struggling in school and was getting bad grades. White became upset and furious when Harkins told him that Durhams mother was on the way to pick her up. Harkins advised that White later pulled out his firearm from the bedroom closet, but told Harkins to not worry about him doing anything with the firearm. Harkins advised she was scared for her life, so she called 911. Harkins advised she was scared because White was drunk, and she did not know if he was going to harm anyone with the gun. I asked Harkins if the gun was ever pointed at her direction, and she stated No. I asked Harkins if she was ever physically hit, and she stated No. I did not observe any signs of injury on Harkins, or anyone else on scene.    I asked Harkins if she knew why the gun was left on the table, and she advised that is where White left it. Harkins advised White walked outside to his car, so she took the opportunity to lock the door on him, so he would no longer be a threat to her, or any of the children at the residence. After speaking to Harkins regarding the dispute between her and White, I asked Harkins if she had any other information regarding the possible second handgun. Harkins walked up to the closet, and advised the gun was not there. For safety reasons, I asked Harkins if she would consensually look for the gun inside the residence, and she stated Yes.    It should be noted that Harkins advised she was never directly threatened with the gun, and there were no physical altercations. The domestic dispute was verbal, but Harkins was scared after White pulled out his firearm.  After speaking to Harkins, I spoke to the two daughters who were at the residence. I initially spoke to Durham who advised she heard her step-mother (Harkins) arguing with White. Durham advised she came home from school, and noticed Whites belongings outside the residence inside a trash bag. Durham stated White arrived home later that evening, and found out that Durhams mother was on the way to pick her up. Durham advised that made White mad, so he pulled out his gun, but never shot it, or pointed it at anyone. Durham advised she did not see any physical altercations occur. I asked Durham if White started the argument, and she stated yes. I told Durham that her biological mother was on the way to pick her up, so I asked her to gather any belongings that she might need. It should be noted that Durham became upset and started to tear up. Durham advised she does not have a great relationship with her mother, and prefers to stay with her dad (White).  While speaking to Durham, I was advised by the on-duty Maryland State Police Emergency Dispatcher that the Beretta was confirmed to be stolen from the Beretta USA Corporation located at,17601 Beretta Dr, Accokeek, MD 20607. Maryland Gun Center Investigator William L. Szimanski #3147 ran the gun.  After speaking to Durham, I spoke to the other daughter who heard the altercation. The other daughter was identified as, Delila Haile Mayet White (B/F DOB: 12/23/2011). Delila advised she was on her phone when she heard her parents arguing. Delila advised her parents were outside on the back porch when White began arguing. Delila advised White found out that Harkins was on a dating app, so that made him mad because White provides for the entire family while Harkins cheats on him. Delila stated White told Harkins to call her parents, so they could pick Harkins up and take her away from the residence. Delila stated she went to get her little sister from Harkins arms. While doing so, Delila stated she saw a gun on the table, and she heard Harkins ask why there was a gun on the table. Delila advised that White stated Harkins did not need to worry why there was a gun on the table. Delila left immediately after because she did not want to get involved.  After speaking to the two daughters, Harkins advised she found the second firearm. Harkins stated the gun was in a room downstairs where White usually sleeps. Harkins stated the gun was underneath his pillow. The gun was revealed to be a Hi-Point CF-380, .380 ACP. The serial number was obliterated, and were scratched off and removed, so the gun was not able to be identified. Harkins advised the Hi-Point was also unregistered.  After speaking to Harkins, I walked outside and made contact with White. White was placed under arrest for possessing a stolen firearm at approximately 2207 hours. White was escorted to my marked patrol vehicle, U-19, and was read his Miranda Rights at approximately 2210. White waived his rights, and advised he would answer any questions I had for him. I explained to White everything that Harkins told me. White appeared to be more cooperative, and was no longer argumentative. I advised White that Harkins stated he pulled a gun out during the argument regarding Durhams mother picking her up from the residence. White advised he pulled his gun out, but he never pointed it at her, towards her, or near her. White stated Harkins pointed his gun towards him at one point, but he advised it was in the past. White advised he never reported Harkins because he did not want her to get in trouble. White stated he moved his gun away from Harkins reach because he did not want her to point his gun towards him once again. I asked White if the gun that was mentioned belonged to him, and he stated Yes. I told White the firearm was stolen, so I asked him where he purchased it. White advised he purchased the gun off of someone he did not know. White stated a friend of a friend referred him to the seller, and he bought the gun off of the guy because of convenience purposes. White advised his brother was murdered, and the murderer is known to break into multiple houses. White advised he needed a firearm to protect his family, and it was easier to purchase the Beretta from the seller than to buy a gun from a licensed dealer/store. I asked White how much he purchased the gun for, and he advised $600 cash. I asked White if he knew the name of the person he bought the gun from, and he advised he bought the firearm from Nat. White does not know any other information regarding Nat. I asked White what year he bought the gun, and he stated years ago. White was unable to provide the exact date of purchase, but he did advise it was purchased in Fort Washington, MD.    S/T Ditoto arrived on scene at approximately 2214 hours. S/T Ditoto spoke to White regarding the stolen Beretta. S/T Ditoto later asked White if there were any other firearms that he should not have that are inside the house. White stated No. S/T Ditoto asked White if he was the only male that lived at the residence, and White stated Yes. White advised the only people that lived at the residence were, his wife, his children, and himself.    After S/T Ditoto spoke to White, I spoke to White once again. White was asked if there were any other firearms inside the residence, and he stated, No. I told White that an additional firearm was found under a pillow of his bed. White shook his head, and later admitted to having the second firearm (Hi-Point). I asked White if he knew why the serial number was scratched off, and he stated No. White stated he was given the gun, and he was not a gun fanatic, so he did not know about the serial number being scratched off. White stated he won the Hi-Point when he was gambling with people he did not know. White stated he was rolling dice with someone who did not have any money. The opponent offered/bet the handgun. White advised they rolled their dice, and White won, so he won the Hi-Point. White stated the Hi-Point came as is, and he did not scratch the serial number off. I asked White if he knew the person he beat rolling dice, and he stated he knew his name. Whites opponent was identified as Chris Marshall. Marshall is approximately five foot nine inches tall (59), and approximately the same age is White.    I asked White to repeat all the information he had just told me regarding the second gun to S/T Ditoto. White later advised he won the gun approximately two (2) years ago in Accokeek, MD.  In the end, White admitted to owning both of the firearms located inside the residence. White was asked if there were any other firearms inside the residence, but he advised there were no other guns. White stated we could search his house from top to bottom if we wanted to. Both firearms were seized and later transported to the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack for processing.    It was later revealed that White had made threatening comments to S/T Rucker and TFC Bauer while on-scene. White stated, If my crew rolled up to my house strapped like yall, yall would be hurtin, yall are lucky I dont have my phone.  White was later transported to the Calvert County Detention Center. It should be noted that while I was en-route to the detention center, White stated I will remember you Hernandez. Once at the detention center, White took a breath test at approximately 1136 hours. The PBT revealed a BrAC (Breath Alcohol Concentration) of 0.128.    White was charged with PS 5-138 Regulated Firearm: Stolen/Sell Etc, PS 5-144(a)(2) Knowingly altering firearm ID number, CR 6-306(a) Manufacturer Serial # Remove Obliterate, and CR 3-204(a)(1) Reckless Endangerment.    Photographs were taken of the seized property and uploaded to VeriPic.    I have requested both firearms to be test fired, and I have also requested the Hi-Point to undergo a serial number recovery.    Corporal Davis sent two handle with care notifications for Jasyah Durham and Delila White.    Case open pending serial number recovery.  All events occurred in Calvert County, MD. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on MSP issued body worn camera.      On October 6, 2023 at approximately 2119 hours, TPR Hernandez #7266 as well as other Troopers from MSP Prince Frederick Barrack responded to 610 Quiver Court, Lusby, Calvert County, Maryland for the report of a domestic dispute with a firearm involved. Upon arrival Troopers contacted the complainant, Katina Harkins (B/F, DOB 01/12/1987), as well as Dwight Nathaniel White (B/M, DOB: 10/04/1985). Tpr Hernandez observed a firearm in plain view The firearm was secured and identified as a Beretta PX4 Storm SN: PZ69172. A check through NCIC revealed the firearm was reported stolen from Beretta in Accokeek, Maryland three years prior. The investigation determined the domestic dispute was verbal only and the firearm was not brandished or used in threats by White. White only allegedly moved it to different locations throughout the house including the bedroom and bathroom during the dispute and while walking in and out of the residence to retrieve alcohol. There was no indication of any assault occurring.   Due to the domestic and the stolen firearm present in the residence, the Duty Officer, CPL T. Davis, contacted me, ST S. DiToto #5416 at approximately 2151 hours. I was briefed on the above incident and due to the investigation continuing on scene with the suspect still on site, I responded directly to the scene. While enroute, I was contacted by TFC Bauer who advised Harkins had provided Troopers with a second firearm she alleged to belong to White. Troopers identified that firearm as HiPoint CS .380 with an obliterated serial number. He further advised White had been detained, had calmed down, and had waived his Miranda Rights while still on scene. Prior to arriving, I conducted a brief review of Secure Case Search and no obvious disqualifying circumstances were located. A full check via the Maryland Gun Center was pending at that time.   I arrived on scene at approximately 2213 hours, and observed Tpr Hernandez completing his on scene interview of White. I then contacted White and interviewed him regarding the firearms. White advised he purchased the Beretta from and unidentified male at a non-specific location in Fort Washington, Maryland for $600 approximately three years ago. He stated he did not know it was stolen. When asked why he did not utilize an FLL if he was not prohibited, White stated because it was convenient. White explained the HiPoint was obtained from a subject known as Chris with a description of average build while gambling in Accokeek, Maryland approximately a year ago. White stated he is not a firearms expert and paid no attention to if the serial number was obliterated. He also advised he was not aware the Beretta was stolen. White began to explain the domestic situation and asked me to look in his cellular phone for corroborating information. I obtained consent to check for that information as well as anything firearms related. Aside from apparent messages related to a non-physical domestic, no information of value was observed. White stated he obtained the Beretta for home/personal defense reasons. White advised he had no information regarding other criminal activity for debrief. While speaking with White, he described the locations the firearms were stored in the residence and encouraged Troopers to search the house to confirm such. It was noted that although corporative, White was apparently under the influence of alcohol and his responses reflected such. The interview was concluded and White was transported by Tpr Hernandez to Calvert County Detention Center for the firearms violations.   I then conducted an interview of Katina Harkins. During the interview Harkins statements matched timeline information regarding the firearms, as well as other details from Whites statements. Harkins made statements indicating White only possessed the two firearms. She stated she did not know how he specifically obtained the firearms or from who. She advised they had previously attempted to legally purchase firearms, but White was turned away by employees as he had been drinking. Harkins stated she had little to do with the firearms as she was uncomfortable with them. Harkin signed a consent to search (MSP 78) and directed Troopers to the locations in the residence where firearms were previously located. The search only revealed an empty shoulder holster in the bedroom closet and no other evidence of value to this case. A photograph of that item is attached to this report. The interview was concluded.   The Maryland Gun Center report was later received and reviewed. It was observed White is not prohibited from possessing firearms. No additional leads to pursue. Case remains closed by arrest.  Above events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
