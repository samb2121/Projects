         <NarrativeText>Unmarked S-12 MSP Form 246 Domestic Violence Supplemental Report    On 02/09/2023 at approximately 2245 hours, I, Trooper First Class Maranto #7116 of the Maryland State Police Centreville barrack was on duty operating unmarked MSP vehicle S-12. I was dispatched to 440 Main Street, Apartment 202, Stevensville, Maryland 21666 for the report of a domestic assault. Dispatch advised the female caller had locked herself in the bedroom and had been assaulted by a male. Upon my arrival, I made contact with the female caller inside of the residence. I asked for her information. A Maryland Drivers License positively identified her as Karolina Dorota Reitz (W/F DOB: 07/01/1987) of 440 Main Street, Apartment 202, Stevensville, Maryland 21666.  I asked Karolina what happened this evening. I could tell she had been crying and was upset. Karolina advised that her and her boyfriend Christopher, had been in a physical confrontation. I asked her if she needed EMS for any of her injuries, and she declined and stated she did not need EMS. Karolina advised that her boyfriend had been drinking alcohol, and they had sat down to eat dinner, when he became upset. She advised that he was getting angry because she wasnt eating the food that he had gotten. She also stated he was upset that she was on the phone with her mother. Karolina advised she only had a glass of wine. Karolina advised that they began verbally arguing, and then they took the argument to the bedroom. At that time, her boyfriend Christopher shoved her over the bed, pushed her down, and possibly punched her on the left leg. Karolina fell over the bed and struck her right elbow as well. Karolina had fresh bruising on her right elbow and an open abrasion, as well as bruising beginning to form on her left leg. She also had fresh scratch mark and abrasion across her chest. I asked her if she knew where the scratch mark came from, and she advised it was from her boyfriend. Karolina advised that when he drinks alcohol, he becomes violent and has a short temper, and will get upset about small things. She advised he had numerous alcoholic drinks including six (6) shots of Fireball Whiskey. I asked her how long they had been together, and she advised about 4 years going on 5 years. Karolina advised they had been living at the apartment for about 3 years. Karolina told me that her and her boyfriend have had about 15 prior incidents of domestic violence, and the police have been to the residence numerous times. Karolina told me that he had been previously arrested for assaulting her as well. Karolina told me that Christopher then kicked her dog multiple times during the argument, because the dog was protecting her. She advised she did not assault Christopher at all, and just put her arms up and told him to stop.  I went outside the apartment and made contact with the male half. A name and date of birth positively identified him as Christopher Lee Aisquith (W/M DOB: 07/18/1986) of 440 Main Street, Apartment 202, Stevensville, Maryland 21666. I asked Christopher what happened. Christopher said that in the beginning everything was fine. He advised that she then got upset with him. Christopher was upset and yelling that she was calling him A piece of shit. He advised she told him to get out of the house. Christopher advised that they continued arguing and that he shoved her over the bed. Christopher told me that she then bit his hand. Christopher did have a sign of abrasion on his hand, but then he said Im not sure if it was her or the dog. I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I asked him if he needed EMS to respond for his injuries, and he declined. Christopher advised that he was tired of her calling the cops, and that every time shes called the police before hes had to leave the residence.    I returned inside the home and went over the Domestic Violence Supplement form with Karolina. She did screen in and complete the form, but did not screen in at high risk. Karolina declined to speak to a domestic violencecounselor. I gave Karolina a pamphlet on how to obtain a protective order. I also issued her a case number and information. Karolina advised it was an alcohol problem that causes the fighting.  Due to physical signs of injury, the fact that theyve lived together for 3 years, and the assault just occurred, I placed Christopher under arrest at 2320 hours for domestic assault. Christopher refused to speak to me after being placed under arrest. I then transported Christopher to the barrack for further processing. Christopher was not cooperative during the investigation. I then transported Christopher to the Queen Annes County Commissioners Office, where he was held without bond. I then transported Christopher to the Queen Annes County Detention Center.  I request this case be closed, by arrest.  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
