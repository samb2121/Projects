         <NarrativeText>On Saturday, October 1, 2023 at approximately 0352 hours I, TFC. T. Bertrand #6858 was dispatched to the area of Northbound Route 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) south of Route 304 (Ruthsburg Road) for a subject who stated he was in an accident. I arrived on scene and observed a gray Toyota Tacoma parked splitting lane two and lane three (exit lane). I made contact with the driver, later identified as Austin Lee Watts Jr. (DOB: 11/06/1951, 2/M) through his Tennessee drivers license. As Watts was handing me his license he asked if I wanted the licenses of the other individuals in the vehicle. I looked inside the vehicle and observed no passengers. I escorted Watts to the shoulder area of the roadway to speak with him further. I asked Watts what happened to which he stated he was in an accident. He stated there was machinery around and that there was about 40 people at the time. I observed the front right of the vehicle to have damage.Watts stated there were people standing by some traffic barrels and traffic sign. I observed no people to be standing by the barrels. He also stated it was the first time he was on one of those machines and was struck in the face. I observed that his airbag was not deployed and did not observe any signs of physical injury. EMS was then dispatched precautionary. I asked Watts how he arrived to our location to which he stated he had training for his job. I asked what town his training was in to which he pointed to the ground and said right here. Watts was asked what town we were in to which he could not answer, I also asked him what state he was in to which he replied Tennessee. Watts informed me that he sold his house on Friday and that he was moving to California, then corrected himself to New York. Watts then asked me about his vehicle, I believed his vehicle to be drivable . He then once again stated we needed to remove the people in his vehicle. I informed Watts that there were no people in his vehicle. Watts agree and give me permission to move his vehicle to the shoulder. Once I made contact with his again he stated he saw those people again up by the traffic barrels. After telling Watts again that there were no people there, he requested I hold his hand and walk over there to look. I walked with him to the barrels and once again showed him there were no people there. Watts then stated he thought maybe they had moved underneath the barrels. EMS arrived on scene and Watts voluntarily wanted to be evaluated at the hospital for the complaint of his face injury. Watts was transported to Easton Memorial Hospital for further treatment. ELB Towing towed the vehicle to their lot.  Contact was made with his son Austin Watts III, phone number 347-404-2195. He was notified of the incident, provided tow information, hospital contact information, and barrack information for further questions.  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
