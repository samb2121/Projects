         <NarrativeText>TYPE OF REPORT: -Emergency Petition- MSP CASE #: 23-MSP-039476  DATE: 11/07/2023 TIME: 1605 hrs.  NARRATIVE:    On Tuesday, November 7th 2023 at approximately 1605 hrs. I (TFC. B. Davis #7043) made contact with Lorraine Derrickson in the lobby of the Berlin Barrack. Derrickson drove to the barrack in a nightgown and barefoot and was unable to tell me why she was there. When I asked Derrickson if she needed anything she stated that she didnt and that she thinks she came to the barrack to get help with her mental health. I contacted CRT who came out to speak with Derrickson. I was also able to make contact with local family of Derrickson, and they too responded to the barrack. CRT was comfortable with safety planning with Derricksons family, and they advised that they would follow up about different treatment options over the coming days.    On Wednesday, November 8th 2023 at approximately 1530 hrs. I responded out to 12615 Collins Road in Bishopville to once again make contact with Derrickson and her family. According to her son Derrickson had destroyed her house and was outside throwing items in the yard. Her son stated that he knew we would have to take her to the hospital for an emergency petition however he did not believe that she would go with him. Upon my arrival I noticed several items all in the yard to include clothing and what appeared to be frozen foods. The back deck to the residence also had plastic tubing that had been broken and thrown on the ground. I was able to speak with Derrickson who was visibly more distraught than the day prior and seemed to be extremely out of it. When I questioned Derrickson on what had happened today she stated that she wasnt really sure. She stated that she wanted to feed the birds, so she threw some food out of the house for them. She stated that she wasnt really sure why she threw her clothes outside but that she did remember doing it.  Based on CRT already having responded the day prior and being very close to completing an emergency petition the day prior. Based on Derricksons mood swing and behavior, her lack of appetite and sleep. Based on the statements made by Derrickson on not taking her medication recently or only taking it when she saw fit an emergency petition was completed and Derrickson was transported to Tidal Health where she was released into their custody without any further incident.    Meghan from CRT who was contacted on Tuesday made contact with me on Thursday morning and advised me that Derrickson had been committed at Tidal Health.  All above events occurred in Worcester County Maryland.</NarrativeText>
