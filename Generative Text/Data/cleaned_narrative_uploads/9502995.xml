         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-003728  Incident: CR 10-114: Possession of an alcoholic beverage by person under 21  Date/ Time: 01/29/2023, 2349 hours  Location of Offense: W/B MD at Dede Rd, Finksburg, Carroll County, MD.  Incident recorded on AXON digital recording system assigned to G-39 and AXON body camera assigned to me.  Attachments:  -copy of MVA records -copy of traffic citation -copy of Civil Citation  Training  Qualifications:  -MSP Academy, June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007  -I am trained to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through NHTSA and the Maryland State Police (MSP Academy, June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007).  -I am trained and certified to operate a Kustom ProLaser III, set # 6. All records are kept on file at the MSP Electronic Services Division and Westminster Barrack, the unit was found to be in working order prior to and following the stop, and was used in accordance to MSP policy, my training, and the manufacturers guidelines. My training, certification, and the Certificate of Accuracy for the LIDAR unit are non-expiring.  -I have attended and graduated from the University of Maryland University College Advanced DUI College (UMUC January 7-11, 2013).  -I have attended and completed training Enhanced DUI Enforcement: The Complete Arrest (MPCTC, 05/11/2016).  -A.R.I.D.E.: Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (MPCTC, 03/29-03/30/2017)  Driver:  MD DL MD10272563461 COLIN SAMUEL REED 726 EDEN FARM CIR WESTMINSTER, MD 21157 2/M, DOB 05/17/2005  Defendant:  MD DL H-400-585-564-780 MARISSA LYNN HALL 440 NORTH GORSUCH RD WESTMINSTER, MD 21157 2/F, DOB 10/10/2004 443-608-7508  Neighborhood Check:  None completed due to the nature of the incident.  Scene Processing:  I conducted a search of the vehicle based on the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the passenger compartment and the fact that none of the occupants were 21 years of age or older. On the rear passenger side floor, I located an open bottle of SVEDKA Blue Raspberry vodka, still containing 1/3 of its contents. I poured out the container at the scene, disposing of its contents (captured on BWC).  Narrative:  Reason for stop:  On 01/29/2022 at approximately 2349 hours, I was in uniform, on duty, operating a marked MSP patrol vehicle: G-39. I was stationary on the right shoulder of W/B MD 140, W/O the Baltimore/ Carroll County line, inside Carroll County, MD. I was also utilizing a Kustom ProLaser III, set # 5 (see above listed training and qualifications). I observed a vehicle traveling W/B MD 140 in lane 1 (left lane of travel) approaching my location at a speed that appeared to be above the posted speed limit of 50 mph. The vehicle is described as gray 2011 Chevy Equinox, displaying Maryland tag of 6DS4295. I activated the LIDAR unit, obtained a solid visual lock, which was accompanied by an audible tone. The LIDAR unit displayed a speed reading of 66 mph in the posted 50 mph at a distance of 1,517.4 feet. I was able to enter the roadway, get behind the vehicle, activated my emergency equipment (specifically the overhead red and blue lights) and initiated a traffic stop. I observed the vehicle had four occupants: male driver, female front passenger, male rear driver side passenger, and female rear passenger side passenger.  Contact:  I made contact with the driver on the drivers side, identified myself, advised the stop was being recorded, and stated the reason for the stop. The driver provided his license and the vehicle registration card upon request. The driver was identified to be COLIN SAMUEL REED by his MD DL. I detected the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. I had the driver exit the vehicle to separate him from the odors emanating from the passenger compartment. I did not detect any odors of alcoholic beverages emanating from the driver. The driver advised the none of the occupants of the vehicle were 21 years of age or older. I had the occupants exit the vehicle. The rear passenger side passenger was identified to be MARISSA LYNN HALL by her Maryland Drivers license. I detected the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from HALLs breath and person. I conducted a search of the vehicle based on the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the passenger compartment and the fact that none of the occupants were 21 years of age or older. On the rear passenger side floor, I located an open bottle of SVEDKA Blue Raspberry vodka, still containing 1/3 of its contents. I poured out the container at the scene, disposing of its contents (captured on BWC). I asked the vehicle occupants to whom did the vodka belong. HALL stated the vodka was hers.  The driver was issued a traffic citation for the speed violation, and HALL was issued a Civil Citation for the Under 21 Possession of Alcoholic Beverage violation. HALL was also provided the Notice to Appear and Notice to Right of Counsel. All parties were released from the scene.  All events did occur in Carroll County, MD.  Case closed. </NarrativeText>
