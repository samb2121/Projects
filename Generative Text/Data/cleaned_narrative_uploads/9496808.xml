         <NarrativeText>The following incident was recorded via my MSP Issued Body Worn Axon Camera and MSP Marked Vehicle G-9s interior mounted Axon Camera.  Incident: Assist Other Agency, Naloxone Administration  Location: Northbound Maryland Route 32 at Pine Knob Road Sykesville, Carroll County, Maryland 21784  Date/Time Occurred: March 25th, 2023 at approximately 0330 hours  Attachments: MVA Printout of Person Involved  Narrative:   On March 25th, 2023 at approximately 0235 hours, I, TFC Hollinger #6938 of the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack, responded to the area of Northbound Maryland Route 32 at Sandosky Road in Sykesville, Carroll County, Maryland, to assist Sykesville Police Departments Officer Pichardo #SY1896. My involvement in that incident is captured via my MSP Issued Axon Body Worn Camera under Incident 2023-00124379. During this incident, Officer Pichardo arrested Eric Thomas Gosnell, DOB: 11/13/1994 for possession of a controlled, dangerous substance. Officer Pichardo had made a second arrest, and requested my assistance to transport Gosnell to Carroll County Central Booking. Gosnell was placed in the front of MSP Marked Vehicle G-9 with my interior mounted Axon recording device activated simultaneously with my body worn camera. While in route to Central Booking, I observed Gosnell was exhibiting multiple symptoms of an opiod overdose to include: labored breathing, delirium, nodding off, and inability to maintain a seated posture. I pulled my vehicle over to the right shoulder of Northbound Maryland Route 32 at Pine Knob Road and administered my MSP issued naloxone into Gosnell. Shortly thereafter, Gosnell became noticeably more alert and conscious, indicating the administration of the naloxone was successful. I then requested EMS respond to the scene to transport Gosnell to Carroll Hospital Center for treatment. Medic Unit #139 of Gamber Fire Department, run #23005370, transported Gosnell to Carroll Hospital Center for treatment. M/T Fair #5334 followed the Medic Unit to the hospital and assumed the care of Gosnell.  I request this case be closed.  All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Supplement Report 23MSP010669, related to Sykesville PD report # 9704  Date/Time of Incident: 03/25/2023, 0238 hours  My involvement with this incident was captured on Body Worn Camera and uploaded to Axon Evidence.  Training Qualifications:  -Maryland State Police Academy (June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007) -Street Narcotics Investigation for Road Patrol (MPCTC, 05/22/2015)  Narrative:  On 03/25/2023 at approximately 0337 hours, TFC Hollinger was transporting ERIC THOMAS GOSNELL to Carroll County Central Booking for Officer Pichardo (Sykesville PD, ID # 1896). While in route, TFC Hollinger observed the subject to appear to be suffering an opioid overdose. TFC Hollinger stopped his vehicle on the side of the roadway on MD 32, N/O Pine Knob Rd, Sykesville, Carroll County, MD. TFC Hollinger called for EMS and administered his issued dose of NARCAN to GOSNELL in accordance with the training he had received from MSP. Medic 139 (run # 23005370) and I arrived on scene at approximately 0401 hours. Medic 139 transported GOSNELL to Carroll Hospital Center Emergency Room (located at 200 Memorial Ave, Westminster, Carroll County, MD) and I followed. At the request of Officer Pichardo, I issued GOSNELL a criminal citation charging him with CR 5-601(A)(1) CDS: Possession Not Marijuana (CJIS *1_1111*). While I was filling out the criminal citation, GOSNELL was becoming increasingly agitated while in the ER. GOSNELL stood up, and I observed a glass vial containing off-white powdery substance fall from his front right pants pocket to the floor directly in front of him. I immediately seized this evidence, and conducted a search of GOSNELL. Nothing else of evidentiary value was located. I recognized the powdery substance through knowledge, training, and experience with the Maryland State Police to be anopioid (heroin), a Controlled Dangerous Substance of Schedule 1.  GOSNELL was issued and signed the criminal citation for the CDS violation and was issued the Notice to Appear and Notice of Right to Counsel. GOSNELL was released from police custody at approximately 0505 hours on 03/25/2023. GOSNELL was also released from CHC Against Medical Advice at that time.  I immediately responded to the MSP Westminster Barrack, captured the seized CDS on MSP Form 67 and stored it in the MSP Westminster Barrack Temporary Evidence locker, to await retrieval by Officer Pichardo.  All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.</NarrativeText>
