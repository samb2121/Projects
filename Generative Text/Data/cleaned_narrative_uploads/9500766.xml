         <NarrativeText>Reporting: TFC J. Ingram #6663// B-60 In-Car Camera- Not Activated// Body Worn Camera-Activated  Attachments: -MVA Printouts  Suspect: Jesse Robert Lawton; DOB 10/15/2002  Neighborhood check: Body camera was activated and captured the entire incident.  Narrative:  On May 8, 2023, I TFC J. Ingram responded to assist the Walkersville Fire and Rescue and the Frederick County Sheriffs Office with a subject passed out on a park bench. EMS and I arrived to the area of 8740 Stauffer Road, Walkersville, Maryland 21793 observed a black male laying on the picnic table. The male woke up as soon as we pulled our emergency vehicles onto the basketball courts. I identified the male by his name and date of birth to be Jessie Robert Layton, 10/15/2002, through the state of Florida. While Jessie was having his vitals checked by EMS; I walked over to my police vehicle and ran his name through METERS, and it advised Jessie was possibly wanted through the state of Florida. Dispatch confirmed that Jessie was wanted through Florida for Violation of Probation. EMS began to walk to my location and advised he refused any medical treatment and refused going to the hospital. Dispatch advised the name that was provided was spelled incorrectly. They advised his name is Jesse Robert Lawton, DOB: 10/15/2002; 1/M. I observed Jesse walking away towards the Discovery Crossing shopping center. I drove my marked patrol vehicle over to the shopping center, in attempt to locate Jesse. Initially, I was unable to locate Jesse. I parked my patrol vehicle, facing the Goodwill, and updated DFC Virtz of Jesses description. While speaking to DFC Virtz, I observed Jesse walking out of the Dollar General with a black female. DFC Virtz and I approached Jesse and made initial contact. DFC Virtz advised Jesse that he had a warrant through the state of Florida. Jesse stated oh no not a warrant, turned to the left and began to run towards 8740 Stauffer Road, towards the park. I advised the barrack that I was in a foot pursuit. DFC Virtz and I observed Jesse drop his book bag and continued to run towards Eureka Lane. DFC Virtz, DFC Thomas and I checked the area and were unable to locate Jesse. I advised the dispatcher to start Aviation. DFC Thomas and I began to back track to where we last observed Jesse. DFC Thomas advised he was last seen turning left behind the fence line of Eureka Lane. I observed one gate to be open. DFC Thomas and I walked towards the fence and I observed Jesse hiding behind a trash can, curled into the fetal position. I was unable to see Jesses hands. He had his has tucked tightly under his chest. DFC Thomas and I drew our weapons from the holster and pointed it at Jesses center mass, with my trigger finger indexed on the frame, along with giving Jesse verbal commands. DFC Thomas and I gave multiple orders for Jesse to lay flat on the ground and show us his hands. Jesse complied with all orders. I placed my weapon into my holster, walked to the rear of Jesse and successfully placed my agency issued handcuffs onto Jesse without any further incident. Jesse was searched incident to arrest by Deputies. EMS was requested to evaluate Jesse. Jesse was transported to Frederick Health Hospital for evaluation.  All events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  Case: Closed</NarrativeText>
