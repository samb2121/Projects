         <NarrativeText>23MSP011855   Incident: Accidental Overdose  Date/ Time: 04/03/2023, 0923 hours  Location:  Shoemaker Center 6951 4th Street Sykesville, MD 21784  Incident not recorded. My contact with the victim was captured AXON BWC, uploaded to evidence.com under this case number.  Attachments:  -copy of MD ID -copy of C.I.T. Referral  Training  Qualifications:  -Maryland State Police Academy (June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007)  -C.I.T.: Crisis Intervention Team (Carroll County), (Carroll County Public Safety Training Center, 11/05-11/09/2018)  -C.I.T.: Crisis Intervention Team (Carroll County) refresher training: Suicide Intervention  Prevention (Carroll County Public Safety Training Center, 05/09/2022)  De-Escalation: N/A  Victim:  MD ID B-620-603-585-886 MICHELLE MARIE BURROUGHS 6732 KILLDEER CT FREDERICK,MD 21703 2/F, DOB 11/19/1976  BURROUGHS stated she went to the Shoemaker Center to check herself in for rehab. BURROUGHS stated she took her daily prescriptions of methadone (unknown amount), Xanax, and Adderall. BURROUGHS stated she is prescribed three pills of Xanax (unknown dosage) but took five in an effort to medicate herself because she was going into rehab. BURROUGHS stated she took the extra medications to self-medicate, not in an effort to kill or harm herself. BURROUGHS admitted to having had thought of harming herself and suicide in the past, but not within the last couple years. BURROUGHS denied consumed any additional medications or any Controlled Dangerous Substances at this time.  Scene Processing:  None completed due to the nature of the incident.  Neighborhood Check:  None completed due to the nature of the incident.  Narrative:  On 04/03/2023 at 0923hrs I was on duty, in uniform, operating a marked MSP patrol vehicle: G-39. I responded to the Shoemaker Center at the Hitchman building, located at 6951 4th Street, Sykesville, Carroll County, MD, for a report of a possible overdose. Upon my arrival, the victim (MICHELLE MARIE BURROUGHS) had already be transported by EMS Medic 128 to Carroll Hospital Center. I made contact with the Shoemaker staff, and was advised the subject arrived that morning and was in the intake/ checking in process when she appeared to become out of it, and unaware of her location. The staff were able to provide the victims name and date of birth, but no further details at this time.  I responded to Carroll Hospital Center Emergency Room (located at 200 Memorial Ave, Westminster, Carroll County, MD). Upon my arrival, contact was made with Medic 128. I was advised by EMS that upon their arrival to Shoemaker, the subject was reclined on a couch, unaware of her location, and unable to provide any details about her address, or dosage of medications consumed. While in transport to CHC, the victim became further incoherent and unable to respond, until given a 2 mg dose of NARCAN. The victim had a positive reaction with the NARCAN and became alert and responsive, but continued to deny any CDS usage.  I then made contact with the victim, and obtained the above listed statement. While speaking with the victim, I observed her pupils to be dilated and non-reactive. I know from my knowledge, training, and experience with the Maryland State Police that extreme pupil dilation can be a reaction of exposure to benzodiazepines (such as Xanax).  Based on my investigation and contact with the victim, I determined that this was an accidental overdose. I decided to complete a C.I.T. Referral for the victim.  All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.  Case closed.</NarrativeText>
