         <NarrativeText>Crime:       Malicious Destruction of Property -$1000  Location:         19414 McMullen Hwy SW, Rawlings MD 21557 / Driveway of residence.  Scene Processing:                Due to the nature of the crime, no scene processing was done.  Narrative:         On 03/31/2023 at approximately 2016 hrs, Cpl Brinkman and I were dispatched by the Cumberland Barrack to respond to 19414 McMullen Hwy, Rawlings, for a report of an MDOP to a vehicle. The barrack advised the complainant advised someone had shot the window out of his vehicle. Upon our arrival we made contact with the complainant, Mr. Justin David Guthrie, W/M, DOB 02/02/1988. Mr Guthrie advised someone had shot the window out of his vehicle with a .22 caliber gun.   After the above I had Mr. Guthrie take me to the vehicle in question. Mr. Guthrie led me to what looked like an old vehicle that was sitting in his front yard. The vehicle was a 1997 F250, displaying no registration. The vehicle also did not have wheels/tires mounted, it was sitting on blocks. Mr Guthrie advised the truck belonged to him and has been off the road for quite some time, therefore it was not currently registered or insured. He advised he was thinking of selling the vehicle, and his dad decided he wanted it, so he was planning on giving it to his father. Mr Guthrie advised he had just parked the truck in that location, and it has only been sitting there for a couple of days, that it did have big wheels/tires on it, and he took them off after he parked it there. Mr Guthrie showed me the damage which was to the extended cab portion of the truck window. I looked at the window and observed the glass to be cracked/spidered all over. I observed the top left corner of the window had a small hole that looked consistent with a BB, not a .22 caliber gun. I advised Mr. Guthrie that it appeared to be a BB, and he advised he still thought it was a .22 caliber weapon. Cpl Brinkman also observed the hole in the glass and agreed it was caused by a BB.  The damage to the vehicle was isolated to just the window with an approximate value of $100.   Mr. Guthire advised, and I knew from passed experience that he has an ongoing issue with his neighbor across the street, located at 19417 Fort Hill Ridge Rd. Mr Guthrie advised he thinks maybe his neighbor may have something to do with the damage, however he did not see him actually do it. While looking at the hole in the window, it did appear it may have come from the direction of that neighbor, however there was no evidence to support that the neighbor was responsible.   I provided Mr. Guthrie with the case number and time for his records and explained to him the option of a peace order if he is still not getting along with his neighbor.   After the above Cpl Brinkman and I responded across the street to the neighbors residence. We were able to speak with Mr. Corey Douglas Ogden, W/M, DOB 09/09/1981. I advised Mr. Ogden about the crime, and asked of I could speak with him as a neighborhood contact and he agreed to speak with me. Mr. Ogden advised he has no idea when the damage occurred that he did not even know it was damaged, and he did not see anyone commit the crime. Mr. Ogden advised there are cars up and down the road between their two homes all the time, and he has no idea who they are. He advised at the end of his road, is an old county road that people seem to go up to often. Mr Ogden advised he would keep his eye out and would contact the barrack if he sees or hears anything suspicious in the future.   The location of the vehicle is in plain sight of both Rt 220 and the road between their home (Fort Hill Ridge Rd) where Mr. Ogden advised he sees vehicles up and down the road. At this point it is unknown who shot the BB and exactly where the BB was shot from.   Due to the above facts, I am requesting this case be suspended.</NarrativeText>
