         <NarrativeText>On March 8, 2023 at approximately 1348 hours, members of SOG-W were in the area of Sheetz located at 2045 Bedford Road, Cumberland, Allegany County, MD conducting proactive criminal enforcement. During this time, I, S/Tpr Whorton was operating my unmarked MSP vehicle CE-144 and S/Tpr Peterson was riding in the front passenger seat. At this time, a blue Jeep bearing MD registration (CFR0026) was observed traveling from the Sheetz store on Bedford Road toward Frederick Street. As the Jeep was observed, there was no front registration plate attached to the front bumper.  Based on the traffic violation, I activated my emergency equipment and stopped the Jeep on the right shoulder prior to Wellington Lane. As the vehicle was stopping the front passenger was making furtive movements around the passenger seat area. I made contact with the driver through the drivers side window, who was identified as Brandon Shook (01/03/1984) and front passenger identified as Sommers Mckinley (07/26/1988). While speaking with Shook, he appeared overly nervous as he was nervously trying to locate his information and admitted to having the front registration plate near the center console. Shooks carotid artery was also beating rapidly in his neck. It should be noted, Shook and Mckinley was traveling from an area known for CDS activity.  Based on observations made, S/Tpr Deaner conducted a free air K9 scan of the vehicle, while utilizing his K9 partner (Captian), which yielded in a positive alert for the presence of narcotics.  A probable cause search of the Jeep was conducted, which revealed the below listed CDS:  1-Bag containing two suspected fentanyl capsules (1 gram) 2-Two black magnetic boxes(One box was attached to bottom of drivers seat and contained the two suspected fentanyl capsules. The second box was empty and located attached to the bottom of the passengers seat) 3-Unknown amount of US Currency (Turned over to ACNTF)  The CDS was seized and turned over to the ACNTF for processing. Shook agreed to speak with ACNTF investigators and charges are pending cooperation. Mckinley was released from the scene.  All the above events occurred in Allegany County, MD.  Case closed.</NarrativeText>
