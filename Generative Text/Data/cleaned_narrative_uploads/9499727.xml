Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack, Road Patrol.   Brief description of incident: On Sunday, August 6th, 2023, at approximately 1407 hours (2:07 PM) S/Tpr. J. Woo #5911 responded to parking lot by The Shrimp Boat Restaurant in reference to a vehicle theft. A 2020 Forest River Wildwood FSX Travel Trailer was stolen from the property. The owner paid for a permit to park his Camper in this lot, and had dropped it off on Monday, July 31st. When he returned on Friday, the trailer was no longer on scene.  Through the investigation, I obtained security footage and witness statements which identified the suspects as three white females. One female was identified as driving a silver Chrysler Pacifica with Eye Lashes on the headlights. The other two suspects drove a teal green pick up truck with a bed cap on it. I was familiar with a silver Chrysler Pacifica, which had eye lashes on the headlights. I was able to obtain a vehicle tag of 6CC1591. A check of this tag showed the registered owner to be a Donna Marie Beers 01/23/1952, and for her to have an address of 11915 Campbelltown Rd.  A check of this address showed a camper trailer which appeared to be the same trailer. The witness was driven by the residence and was able to positively identify the camper as his. I then made contact with the home owner, identified as Beers. Beers stated she believed the trailer belonged to a Lindsay Marie Corrasco Mendez 10/07/1977, and a Kimberly Rey(NFD.)  A check of the trailer tag and VIN confirmed that it was the stolen camper. The camper was recovered and returned to the owner.  All events occurred in Worceter County, MD.

NARRATIVE:  On Sunday, August 6th, 2023 at approximately 2:07PM (1497HRS) I, S/Tpr. J. Woo #5911, was dispatched to respond to the Shrimp Boat parking lot in reference to a stolen vehicle.  Upon my arrival, I contacted the complainant, identified by his MD license as Banna, Bahaa 02/10/1993. Banna stated that he has a permit to park his trailer in the parking lot. He advised that he is trying to contact the owner, Mike to see if he moved the trailer. Banna explained that he used the trailer over the weekend, and parked it back there Monday. He stated that he was coming back today, Sunday, to clean out the Camper.  Banna stated that originally his wife came to get the camper, but she could not find it. He stated that he then came to the lot to look for it and was not able to locate the camper. Banna contacted the owner of the property known as Mike who stated he did not move any trailers and was not away of anything being moved. Mike also advised that there were no cameras available of the parking lot.  After speaking with Mike, Banna showed me where the camper was parked. He explained that he pulled through the parking space from south to north. The trailer tongue was facing north. Banna explained that he had all four stabilizer jacks down on logs of wood, which were also taken.  Banna stated he was upset because he was told by Mike that the parking lot was safe and secure. Banna stated he was under the impression that the lot had security cameras. I asked Banna if he had a hitch lock or any means of securing it. Banna stated that he locked the doors to the camper but he was unaware of hitch locks.  Banna then provided me with the camper information. The Camper trailer was identified as a 2020 Forest River, Wildwood FSX Travel Trailer with a MD registration of 397604X and a VIN of 4X4TWD13LY094141. A check of the registration showed that the vehicle was registered to Banna.  After gathering all the appropriate information from Banna, I conducted neighborhood checks of the area. I first spoke to residence at Trailer #8 at the same address. The occupants advised that they have not observed anything suspicious. They did note that there area always people walking around this parking lot, but nothing stuck out as unusual or suspicious to them.  I then contacted the occupant of trailer 10. She stated she did not see anything. I observed a sign on her door that stated the property was under video surveillance. She stated to check with her next door neighbor because he is the one who has control of the cameras. She explained that where the cameras were hung was closer to the neighbors trailer, so he keeps the hard drive in his trailer.  I then made contact with the owner of Trailer #12, identified as Brendan James Veale 10/20/1991. Veale pulled up an application on his phone and allowed me to review the security cameras. I was able to tell that one of the cameras pointed in the direction of where the trailer was parked. I was able to scroll back through the video footage and narrow down the time of when the trailer went missing.  As I looked at the footage, I was able to see that the trailer went missing around 7:03 PM on Wednesday, August 2nd. As I continued to review the footage, I was able to see the trailer get pulled out of the parking spot at 7:03 PM. I then observed that immediately following the trailer, a silver van pulled out behind the trailer.  As I re-watched the footage, I was able to see what looked like at least 1 male and multiple females walking around the trailer. Due to the camera quality and distance from the trailer, I was not able to determine any unique identifying details. I attempted to make a hard copy of the video footage but was unable to. I then recorded the events off of Veales phone.  I then made several other neighborhood checks of the other trailers in the area. The rest of these checks relieved no further information. Either no one was home, or no one saw anything.  I then drove to the fiberglass shop located in the back corner of the parking lot. Here, I located several individuals outside. Two of people were identified as Joshua A. Neukam 3/14/86 and Emily Suzanne Kershner 01/22/1988. Emily stated she was not here Wednesday. She knew she was at work at 5Guys in Rehoboth, DE, so she knew she did not see anything.  As I spoke with some of the other people on scene, I explained that the trailer was parked between an empty boat trailer and a boat trailer with a boat on it. As I explained this, Emily then stated that she might be mis-remembering things. I told her that Wednesday was August 2nd. She then stated that she took off work on the 1st and 2nd because it was her sons birthday. She then stated that she would have been here Wednesday night.  As I continued to speak with Emily, she stated that she and her boyfriend helped someone hook up a trailer to their truck. She and Joshua explained that there were three woman in a teal colored GMC pick up truck with a bed cover on it. They explained that these three woman were struggling to connect the trailer to the truck, and that the truck kept stalling out as she tried to back it up.  Joshua explained that he actually backed the truck up and connected the trailer to the truck for them. Emily explained that they first came over and asked for a 4-way tire iron to raise up the stabilizer jack stands. After they were done with the 4-way tire iron, they came back and asked for more help.  They explained that an older woman, maybe in her 70s was in a silver van with eyelashes on her headlights and that she stayed in the car for most of it. I am familiar with a silver mini van with eyelashes on the headlights, driven by an older woman in the Ocean City and West Ocean City area. I am familiar with her because I have conducted traffic stops on her in the past, and know her to be an Uber driver for the area.  Emily and Joshua described the other two woman as middle aged, white woman with brown hair. One of the woman was heavy set, and the other had a thinner build. Joshua and Emily stated that the suspects stated their names were Kimmie and Rosie. Emily explained that Kimmie told her she was originally from New York.  Emily and Joshua gave written statements which area attached to the report.  I then drove around and briefly checked the area for any of the vehicles described above but was unable to locate any of them. I then responded to the MSP Berlin Barrack to complete the face sheet of the report and have the vehicle entered into NCIC as stolen.  During further investigation, I contacted a man identified as Theo. Theo advised he was in charge of security cameras at 9741 Stephen Decatur Highway. Theo is attempting to save the security footage to a shareable file, but was able to take a photo and video from his phone and forward it to. These photos and video clearly showed an older model GMC or Chevy style pickup truck towing the Wildwood FSX camper and being followed by a silver Chrysler Mini Van, which appeared to be the Uper driver I was familiar with.   Based on this information, I was able to locate and obtain the tag of the Uber drivers van. The tag was 6CC1591, which was registered to Donna Marie Beers 01/23/1952 at 11915 Campbelltown Rd, Bishopville, MD 21813.  On Friday, August 10th, 2023, I drove by 11915 Campbelltown Rd and could clearly see a Wildwood FSX parked at the house. The trailer was behind the house but visible from the roadway through the side yard. I then parked at Curtis United Methodist Church, just down the street from the home.  I then contacted the barrack and consulted with MSP Criminal Enforcement Division(CED.)  I then contacted, Banna, the owner of the trailer and had him meet me at the church. Banna then rode with my in my patrol car by the trailer. Banna confirmed that from what he can tell, it is his trailer. Banna advised it was the same make and model and appeared to be his trailer. I then took Banna back to his truck and had him wait there while I contacted the homeowner.  The homeowner was identified as Donna Marie Beers 01/23/1952. I introduced myself to Donna and advised her that everything was being recorded. I asked Donna about the camper. Donna explained that she was helping two homeless girls out. Donna explained that the two girls first stayed in her gazebo in the back yard for two nights. Donna stated that after two nights, one of the girls, identified as Lindsay, stated she had a camper, and asked if she could park it on her property and live in it.  Investigation showed that the two females were Kimberly Karla Rey 11/16/1966, and Lindsay Marie Carrasco-Mendez 10/07/1977. A check of the camper showed that it still had the same license plate on the vehicle, and the VIN number matched. A check through NCIC confirmed this was the stolen trailer.  A check of the camper showed a large amount of female belongings inside the trailer including clothing, shoes, personal care products, food, and other personal items.  I then contacted Banna and had him respond to the address to recover his trailer. Upon arrival, Banna pointed out some marks on the trailer which he used to identify the trailer as his.  After going inside the trailer, Banna stated that most everything inside was not his. Banna removed all of the property that was not his from the trailer. While removing items, Banna noted that some things in the trailer had now been broken or ruined and other items were missing.  Banna noted that the queen sized mattress to the right as you walk into the trailer was brand new, fresh and clean. The mattress now had several stains on it. The TV was mounted on the wall, but appeared to be ripped off the wall and was now standing up on the counter. There were holes in the wall from where the TV mount was screwed in.  Banna stated that he had two brand new 12 volt car batteries which were now missing. He also had a blue fresh water hose, an extension cord, a dog-bone adapter for his 30 amp power cord, a sewer hose, and a second propane tank which were all missing. Banna stated that he had one partially used propane tank and one full tank. There was only one tank on the camper. There was also a third 12 volt car battery which was removed from the front of the trailer and not on scene.  Banna stated that the value of each of these items is as follows: 1) $200.00 - Zinns 8 Mattress 2) $190.00(Each) 12 Volt Car batteries (X3) 3) $140.0075 foot 30amp Extension Cord 4) $50.00 CamCo Taste PURE 50 foot 5/8ths drinking safe water hose 5) $57.00 CamCo RhinoFlex 20FT Sewer Hose. 6) $25.00 Dog bone adapter.  Banna later reported that the toilet also now has a leak, which it did not before.  While at Donnas house, Donna state that Lindsay is the one who stated it was her camper, and she believed it was. Donna provided a written statement and advised she would come to court to testify. Donna became more and more upset and visibly angry after finding out that the trialer was stolen. Donna stated she was just trying to help them out by giving them a place to stay.  Donna stated that she no longer wanted either Kimberly or Lindsay on her property, and that they were not allowed to return. Donna stated that Kimberly had a phone that belonged to her and her husband and that she wished to have it back as soon as possible.  I explained that I would attempt to conduct interviews of the two suspects within then next few days and attempt to retrieve her phone at that time. I explained that if she fails to return the phone, she could file charges.  While removing property from the trailer, I observed a small vape product box which contained coins and jewelry which did not belong to the victim. Since neither suspect was on scene and able to claim or prove ownership, the items were seized for safe keeping.  The Jewelry was then transported to the MSP Berlin barrack and placed in temp storage until the proper owner can be located.  TFC. C. Shubert attempted to contact Lindsay and Kimberly and conduct interviews.  On Monday, August 14th, 2023, Kimberly K. Rey responded to the MSP Berlin Barrack with Donna Beers. Kimberliy came to the barrack voluntarily and offered to give her statement as to what happened. This interview was recorded with the use of my Bodyworn camera.  Kimberlys statements corroborated the statements and events which have been previously stated above. Kimberly stated that Lindsay told Kimberly it was her camper. Kimberly stated that Lindsay referred to the camper as My camper. multiple times and that she believed Lindsay owned it.  Kimberly stated that she had no idea it was stolen and would not have is willing to cooperate with the investigation. She stated she believes Lindsay may be staying with her boyfriend Andy, somewhere in Snow Hill, MD.   Based on the information obtained from this interview, Lindsay appears to be the primary suspect. Kimberly was advised that I would be consulting with the States Attorneys office and that there is still a possibility she could be charged in the incident. Kimberly stated she understood, and would cooperate.  Kimberly was released without charges at this time.  I request this case remain open pending further investigation and charges.  All events occurred in Worcester County, MD. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On August 11, 2023, at approximately 0006 hours, I responded to the 7-Eleven where Lindsay was working. I made contact with Lindsay and asked if I could speak to her, which she complied. At approximately 0010 hours, Lindsay was read her Miranda rights, she knowingly waived her rights and was willing to answer the questions I had for her. I asked Lindsay if she knew about a stolen camper, and she advised;No, what in the world. I then advised her there was surveillance footage showing Lindsay was near the camper while it was being stolen, and she advised; What are you talking about.Lindsay then advised she was visiting a friend near the shrimp boat in a camper last week. Lindsay advised that was the only time she was around a camper was when she was visiting her friend. She advised she had a camper and was living near the shrimp boat but has moved since last November.  I then asked who Kimberly was to her, and she advised; I know her through other people.Lindsay then advised she did not take a camper, and she does not drive. Lindsay then advised she remembered Kimberly mentioning a camper she recently got, but she didnt want to share any more details. Lindsay then advised Kimberly mentioned staying in a camper somewhere. Lindsay advised any items that were located within the camper would not be hers. While I was at the stolen RV I noticed inside multiple 7-Eleven cups and a pizza box from 7-Eleven.  I then asked Lindsay if she knew Donna, and she advised; I know who she is, but I just know her through Kim.While myself and Senior Trooper Woo were investigating the located RV we had a chance to speak with Donna, she called Lindsay and asked her where she was, and Lindsay being on speakerphone told Donna she was in Snow Hill, and she just woke up from a nap with Andy. Donna also advised she would go see Lindsay at work later that night. I asked Lindsay if Donna called her earlier already knowing the answer, Lindsay advised; No. I then advised Lindsay I was with Donna when she called, and she still denied talking to Donna. I advised her she told Donna that she was in Snow Hill when she spoke to her, and she said; Yeah.Once I confronted Lindsay again she changed her story advising; I got a fucked up message from Donna, if you talk to Donna please tell her im in Snow Hill.I asked Lindsay if Kimberly told her she bought the camper, and she did not say. Lindsay advised she knows what the camper looks like being Donnas house. I asked Lindsay how she knew what it looked like, and she stated;Id rather not. Lindsay did not give any additional information about the case.  All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #2 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On October 22, 2023, I, S/Tpr. J. Woo #5911 was on duty, riding as a passenger in marked MSP patrol unit V-13. I was in the parking lot of the Snow Hill Fire Department on RT 12 when I observed a vehicle, which I recognized as the same truck that Lindsay Carrasco-Mendez had been driving, and which she had used to take the camper. As the vehicle drove in front of me, I observed there to be a male subject driving and a female in the passenger seat. I was unable to positively identify them, but the female resembled Lindsay Carrasco-Mendez.  I instructed Tpr. ODonald, who was driving V-13, to follow the vehicle. A check of the tag showed it was registered to a different individual. I then instructed Tpr. ODonald to pull up next to the vehicle so that I could see the passenger. After getting a good look at the passenger, and comparing it to a previous arrest photo of Carrasco-Mendez, I believed it was her sitting in the passenger seat. I was also able to confirm that the warrant was still active at this time. I then instructed Tpr. ODonald to stop the vehicle.  The vehicle had continued south on US RT 113 and was now in the area of Woodside lane when Tpr. ODonald stopped it. I then made contact with Carrasco-Mendez on the passenger side of the vehicle. I confirmed that she was Lindsay Carrasco-Mendez and placed her under arrest. She was then placed in the front seat of my patrol car where she was read her Miranda Rights.  I read Carrasco-Mendez the Miranda rights from my MSP issued Pocket card. Carrasco-Mendez stated she did understand her rights.  I then explained that this was related to the camper situation and asked Carrasco-Mendez what she knew about the camper. Carrasco-Mendez stated that she knew who has the camper, or who had the camper. She stated that Kim had the camper, that she could not get it registered in her name because of SSI or Social Security Income. Carrasco-Mendez went on to explain that Kim had a friend that she use to babysit for. A lady named Juanita. Carrasco-Mendez advised that Juanita paid for the camper, so that Kim could be a live in babysitter, but then Juanita moved, so Kim had to move the camper.  Carrasco-Mendez stated that this is when Kim moved the camper to Donas house. Carrasco-Mendez stated that this is the first time she met Dona. She explained that she met Kim through other people.  I then asked Carrasco-Mendez how she ended up living with Kim in this camper. She stated that Kim was in a bad relationship and so Carrasco-Mendez was helping Kim out. This did not make sense to me because Carrasco-Mendez was making it sound like she was the one getting help.  Carrasco-Mendez then stated that Kim was living with her boyfriend, which contradicted her earlier statement about living in a camper on Juanitas property. She stated that Kims boyfriend was supposed to go to rehab, and she was going to move in after he left, but the boyfriend never left. Carrasco-Mendez then stated that she had a vehicle, and offered for Kim to live in the vehicle with her, which is when Kim mentioned owning a camper.  Carrasco-Mendez stated that the camper was still located at the place where Juanita lived, which contradicted earlier statements about having to move the camper due to Juanita moving. She then stated that after Kim told her about the camper, Thats what we did.  I asked her to explain what she meant by thats what we did. She then stated that she and Kim stayed at the camper at Donas house. I asked if the camper was at Donas house or Juanitas house. Carrasco-Mendez stated it was at Juanitas house, and that she moved the camper to Donas House. I then asked for clarification, that Kim is the one who moved the camper. Carrasco-Mendez confirmed that Kim moved it.  I then asked how she moved the camper to Donas house. Carrasco-Mendez stated that she had some help from some friend named Josh. Carrasco-Mendez stated that Josh picked it up and towed the camper to Donas house. I asked if he used his own truck to tow the camper. Carrasco-Mendez first stated yes, it was his. She then paused and stated she did not think she should answer any more questions.  I then spoke to the driver, identified by his MD ID card as Andrew Joshua Posiowaych 09/25/1981. I asked Andrew if he knew what Carrasco-Mendezs arrest was about. Andrew stated he was sure it was about the theft of the camper. Andrew stated his understanding was that Kim and Tim were always fighting and that Kim always makes up a bunch of things.  Andrew stated that Kim inherited a camper from a family member, and that she needed someone to haul the camper. Andrew stated that Carrasco-Mendez was staying with Kim and Tim at Tims apartment, and that Kim wanted to leave Tim, and that Kim stated she had a camper and asked Lindsay to haul the camper for her. Andrew explained that as far as he knows, there were some men that moved the camper off the lot and that is all he knows.  Andrew explained that he was kind of weary on saying all of these things because he did not want to incriminate Carrasco-Mendez. He stated that from what he knew, it was a fabricated story. Andrew stated that he knew Kim from them both being homeless at Diakonia about two years ago. Andrew stated he met Lindsay from working at 7-11 together. He stated that Lindsay and Kim knew each other before he knew Lindsay, but he did not know how they met.  Andrew made a comment stating he hoped he did not do anything to hurt Lindsays case. I explained that he had not told me anything I did not already know. Andrew then confirmed that Lindsay used her truck to tow the camper.  I then took additional photos of the truck prior to leaving the scene. Carrasco-Mendez was then transported to the MSP Berlin Barrack for processing.  During this time, Carrasco-Mendez read the statement of probable cause. She stated that she has her old phone at her house which has all the proof I need and proves that Kim is the one who stole the trailer.  On November 1st, I attempted to contact Carrasco-Mendez in reference to getting the information from her phone. It is November 5th, and I have yet to hear back from Lindsay at this time.  I have continued to make multiple attempts to contact Carrasco-Mendez, through e-mail, by phone, and in person. Carrasco-Mendez has failed to respond to or return any communications.  I request this case be closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Worcester County, MD.   </NarrativeText>
