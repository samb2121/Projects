         <NarrativeText> On Friday, September 22,2023, at approximately 1053 hours the Maryland State Police Cumberland Barrack was contacted by John Hare in reference to an incident that occurred on September 20,2023, between staff members at Green Ridge Youth Center (10700 Fifteen Mile Creek Road South East Flintstone, MD 21530). It was summarized that two of the staff members had verbal remarks with one another during their shift and possibly physical contact. This led to an altercation outside the facility after their work shifts. During that altercation one of the individuals was alleged to be in possession of a firearm. It should be noted that staff of the facility park their vehicles on Fifteen Mile Creek Road and walk to the facility down a flight of stairs. Due to the location where staff are required to park their vehicles, the firearm was not on the state facility property. There are no surveillance cameras in the area where the off premise incident occurred. None of the witnesses captured the events with personal video recording devices (i.e.: cell phone camera footage).   Hare advised that he had collected written statements from several employees that witnessed the incident as well as the two primary employees involved. Several additional witnesses were remaining to complete written statements. An internal investigation is being conducted by the facility. It was determined Group Life Manager Donovan Vinson and RA Thomas Pittman were the involved parties. It is claimed that Pittman waited outside at his vehicle, grabbed something (allegedly a firearm) from the trunk, and stood at driver side of his vehicle. Upon Vinson leaving the facility an additional verbal altercation occurred. It was claimed that then Pittman chambered a round into the firearm. This was described as being heard audibly and not seen. There was no allegation that Pittman pointed a firearm in the direction of anyone.    On September 22, 2023, at approximately 1300 hours I consulted with Deputy States Attorney Linda Thomas, in person, with the limited details associated to this incident. It was determined the additional witness statements were needed to make a conclusion and continue the investigation. The involved state employees, Donovan Vinson and Thomas Pittman, are administratively suspended pending the investigation.    This case remains OPEN for further investigation.  All the above events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  At this time further in person interviews are pending scheduling if applicable. As noted in the initial narrative, a concurrent internal investigation is being conducted under the authority of the administrative structure that oversees the juvenile detention state facility. At the time of the incident being reported, other witnesses, which may be critical to the event, had not been interviewed or had provided written statements to the administration. The incident was not reported at the time of occurrence. In addition to not having the supplementary information, all the witnesses were not present at the facility due to it not being their work hours. If completed, the information has not been received by the Maryland State Police. The statements are required to thoroughly conduct interviews and determine who may have involvement.    This case remains OPEN.    All the above events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On Friday, December 15, 2023, at approximately 1930 hours, I, Senior Trooper E. Wilson #6100, interviewed Rashaan Jordan Haines (DOB: 2/3/2000). Haines claimed that he saw Pittman display a handgun on the night of the incident, but could not describe the firearm. It should be noted that Haines is a suspect in a non-related incident that occurred two days after this incident. Due to conflicting information for this case, as well as the other, Haines is not believed to be a credible source for statements.      On the same date at approximately 1930 hours, I conducted an in person interview of the suspect of this incident, Thomas Pittman. Pittman was advised his Advise of Miranda Rights utilizing a MSP Form 180. Pittman signed the document and stated that he was willing to speak about the incident without counsel. Pittman described his recollection of the events that occurred during the incident. Pittman made no statements that were inconsistent with the written document he provided Green Ridge Youth Center. Pittman stated that at no time did he produce or brandish a firearm and did not deny any of the verbal altercations that occurred. Pittman admitted that he should not have reacted the way that transpired to a supervisor, but added it should have been handled differently by Vinson.     I carefully reviewed each of the written statements that were provided of the staff members that worked during the incident. Of the fifteen individuals information supplied to me as witnesses or involved, ten were received. Due to no video footage to provide unbiased view of the incident, I contacted the Allegany County District Court States Attorney Office for additional consultation. Upon presentation of the known facts, it was recommended by Senior States Attorney Kelty, there is no sufficient evidence to complete an application of charges from the states position. I contacted the victim Donavin Vinson to advise the status of the case and inform him that he may pursue charges from his perspective. Vinson stated that he will not be completing a charging document at this time and is currently awaiting his administrative investigation results.    It should be noted Pittman has been terminated from the facility due to being on probation at the time of the incident. He is awaiting the final disposition documents for termination. Vinson has been demoted and moved to Backbone Mountain Youth Center.    As noted above the victim is aware of the case status.    Case CLOSED. UNFOUNDED.   All the above events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
