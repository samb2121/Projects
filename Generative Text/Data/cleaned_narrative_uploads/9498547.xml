We were parked in the center median at MD RT 5 at Charlotte Hall Road, Charlotte Hall, St. Marys County, MD 20622. I observed a gray Nissan Altima, bearing Maryland registration 4EA9457, with an inoperable, driver side, registration tag lamp. I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a lawful traffic stop of the vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2): I made contact with the operator/sole occupant of the vehicle via the passenger side window, who I later identified by his Maryland drivers license as Calan Antonio White (B/M, DOB: 05/01/1998). While speaking with White, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from inside the vehicle. I observed Whites speech was slurred, his movements were slow and lethargic, and his eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I also observed an empty Coors Light, bottled beer box in the vehicle. I asked White if he had been drinking and how much he had to drink. White stated, No, none. At this time, I requested White exit his vehicle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, to which he complied. While outside his vehicle, I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Whites breath and person. I requested White perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST), to which he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3): The SFSTs were performed on a level, dry surface that was free of any debris. My patrol vehicles front facing emergency equipment was off. Lighting consisted of my patrol vehicles head lamps and my flashlight. Prior to administering the tests, I asked White the following questions:     margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Glasses or Contacts - No.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Injuries - No.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Medical Conditions - No.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Medications - No.    margin-left:16px"&gt;I asked White if there was any reason he could not walk in a straight line, and he replied, No.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 Clues Observed): The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus, and I held it approximately 12 inches away from Whites face, slightly above his eye level. He was instructed to look straight ahead at the stimulus and follow the stimulus with his eyes and his eyes only. I asked White if he understood the instructions, and he replied Yes. Whites pupils were of equal size and displayed equal tracking. I observed no resting nystagmus in either eye.     margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in Both Eyes.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in Both Eyes.   margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in Both Eyes.  *Vertical Nystagmus was not observed during the administration of this test.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 Clues Observed) Prior to performing the test, I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. White was instructed to place his left foot on a straight, imaginary line. White was then instructed to place his right foot on the line, directly in front of his left foot, touching heel to toe. White was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. White stated he understood. White was advised to take nine steps in a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. White was advised to keep his hands flat at his sides, keeping his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step, White was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small choppy steps with his right foot, pivoting 180 degrees on his left foot, to complete his turn. White was instructed that, once he began the test, he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping his hands down by his sides, looking down at his lead foot, and counting each step out loud. I asked White if he understood the test, and he stated he did. White performed the walk and turn test in black socks. White was not wearing shoes at the time of the traffic stop. White preferred to remain wearing his socks only, after being offered to put shoes on.  Instructional Position:    Leaves Instructional Position  Starts Too soon  Walking Stage (First Nine):    "&gt;Raising Arms More than Six (6) Inches  Step 1 (Left Foot)  Improper Turn:    White did not conduct theturn satisfactorily. White stopped walking, and began walking backwards.  Walking Stage (Second Nine):    Steps Off Line  Steps 3 (Left), 6 (Right), 7 (Left)  Misses Heel to Toe by More Than Half an Inch  Steps 8 (Right), 9 (Left)  ONE LEG STAND (3/4 Clues Observed): I explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted before White was instructed to start. White was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides, while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, White was instructed he was to raise the foot of his choice approximately 6 inches off the ground, keeping the raised foot parallel to the ground. While his leg was raised, he was to keep both legs straight, watch his foot, keep his hands at his sides, count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two), and to continue the test until told to stop. I confirmed that White understood the test before he was instructed to begin. White balanced on his left leg to begin the test. White switched to balancing on his right leg after putting his right foot down on second :05.    Puts Foot Down: Seconds - :03, :04, :25, :27  Uses Arms for Balance- :02, :08, :26  Sways  Swaying for the whole duration of the test.  *White was offered a Preliminary Breath Test at 0052 hours, to which White submitted, resulting in a BA/C of 0.01.
