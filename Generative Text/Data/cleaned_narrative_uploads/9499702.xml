         <NarrativeText>DUI ARREST Incident was audibly and visually captured on Q-41s equipped MVR, as well as body worn camera.  Defendant: Rafael Ernesto Dominguez 1st Date of Birth: 11/03/2006 Date of Arrest: 08/05/2023 Time of Arrest: 1011 hours MD License #: MD10273428787 DUI #: 23-169  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES  -Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Baltimore County Police Department, Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, December 2022. -Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.) Trained, November 2017. -Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) Training, July 2018. -University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Law Enforcement Studies DUI Institute, Distinct Graduate, June 2019.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On August 5, 2023 at approximately 0904 hours, I, Tpr. Ryan Stewart #7590, currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack Q was operating unmarked patrol vehicle Q-41 on W/B John Hanson Hwy (US 50) E/O Crain Hwy (Rt 301) when I observed a vehicle stopped on the left shoulder. At that time, I placed my patrol vehicle behind the possible disabled vehicle on the left shoulder and activated my rear emergency lights.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the vehicle on the drivers side and observed the vehicle to be occupied by four individuals and there to be open beer boxes of Corona Extra in the cargo area of the vehicle. I made contact with the male operator, later identified as Rafael Ernesto Dominguez 1st (H/M 11/3/06 16 years of age) by his MD learners permit with J restriction (Alcohol restriction). Rafael advised he did not speak English. While attempting to ascertain information from Rafael I detected the moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle and his breath and person and his eyes to be glassy. Rafael contacted his brother on his cell phone and I briefly spoke with him in regards to picking up the vehicle.  I returned to my vehicle and requested a Spanish speaking officer to respond to my location to better communicate with Rafael. Due to no Spanish speaking officers being available I made contact with Rafael and utilized Google Translate on my cell phone to attempt to more effectively communicate with him outside of the vehicle.   Rafael advised he was traveling from Ocean City to his listed residence when he ran out of gas causing him to become disabled. Rafael stated he left Ocean City at 0400 hours after being there for the day. Rafael advised his girlfriend, her brother and a friend were in the car with him.  As I was communicating with Rafael outside of the vehicle I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I asked Rafael how much he had to drink and he stated 3 or 4 and that his last drink was around 2300 hours the night before (8/4/23). I asked if the stains on his shirt were from spilling beer on him and Rafael advised it was from coffee not beer.  I asked Rafael if he was willing to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Testing (SFSTs), and he advised he was willing to take the test.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on left shoulder of the interstate. The surface was dry, fairly level, and free from any obvious debris and it was day light. Rafael appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Fluentes the following questions: Problems with eyes  None Medical Conditions  None Injuries  None Medications  None   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (4/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. Fuesntes was instructed to look straight ahead, keep his head still, and follow the tip of the stimulus with his/her eyes only. Rafael was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Rafael pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Not Present in both eyes Vertical Gaze Nystagmus  Not Present in both eyes   WALK AND TURN (3/8 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Rafael was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Rafael was then instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and remain in that position until told to begin, he advised he understood. After providing the instructions and demonstration, I asked Rafael if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.Rafael advised he was nervous during the instructions.  Rafael performed this test barefoot as he elected to remove his slide style flipflops.  Instructional Stage: -Stepped from starting position  Walking Stage (1st Nine) -Stepped off line  Turn: Stopped an pivoted, failed to make a series of small steps to turn around.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine) -No clues observed   ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed)  The test was explained and demonstrated. Rafael was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. I asked Rafael if he understood the test and he confirmed that he did.Rafael stated he had no questions.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: No clues observed  Seconds 11-20: No clues observed  Seconds 21-30: No clues observed  Rafael counted to one thousand 26.  While on scene, I informed Rafael of his Preliminary Breath Test Rights. Rafael was offered a PBT, to which he elected not to do.    ARREST  Based on the totality of circumstances, I had reason to believe Rafael was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:    Moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Rafael vehicle/breath/person. Glassy eyes Clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Testing: HGN (4/6), WAT (3/8), OLS (0/4). Driver admitting to consuming three or four drinks Open Corona Extra beer cases in back of vehicle   Due to the number of observations, I concluded Rafael was driving under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a vehicle safely.  At approximately 1011 hours, I placed Rafael under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. I immediately notified the barrack, and searched his person for weapons and contraband, both with negative results.  Rafaels brother Oscar Armando Dominguez Majano (H/M 1/15/97) arrived on scene and I explained the situation to him. Oscar agreed to respond to the College Park Barrack to take custody of Rafael upon his release due to both parents being out of the country.  Rafael was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy. I transported Rafael to the College Park Barrack and while enroute to the College Park Barrack I continued to detect an odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person in my patrol vehicle.  Upon arrival at the College Park Barrack I asked Rafael if he could read and write the Spanish language, he stated he could. Rafael was advised of his Advice of Rights using the Spanish audio recording from the MVAs website. The recording was stopped after the first paragraph and I asked Rafael if he could hear and understand the recording, he confirmed that he could.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD  I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Rafael beginning with his arrest at 1012 hours and nothing was observed in his mouth. The test was conducted by Cpl. M. McGee of the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack on a certified instrument. Rafael had a result of 0.09 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 1130 hours.  I processed Rafael and released him to Oscar in the lobby of the College Park Barrack where he signed and received a copy of the juvenile release form.  The defendant was issued copies of the following documents: -Citations -DR-15 Advice of Rights. -DR-15a Order of Suspension. -MSP 33 Chemical Test Results -Maryland Department of State Police Juvenile Release Form  All documents were forwarded to the Prince Georges County, States Attorney Office and Department of Juvenile Services.  The vehicle driven from the scene by Oscar.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
