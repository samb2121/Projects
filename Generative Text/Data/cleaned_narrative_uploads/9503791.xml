         <NarrativeText>On January 14, 2023, at approximately 0816 hours, I (TFC C. Strong #6699) responded to the Centreville Barrack for a subject in the lobby advising she has a body in the trunk of her vehicle that is parked on US-301. When I walked into the lobby to make contact with her, I observed her bent over with her elbows on her knees, her head was hanging, and she looked to be crying. I was able to identify her by her Delaware drivers license as Jennifer Ann Foley (DOB:03/29/1981 W/F). She was carrying her license, social security number card, and homemade cards from her children, in a Ziploc, in her bra. Foley stated she was homeless and did not have much with her. Foley stated she had traveled from a Motel 8 in New Castle, Delaware because the man that she has been dating for a little over a month, was participating in sex trafficking women at this motel. Foley stated she overheard her boyfriend (Nicholas Wanamaker) talking to someone else about the sex trafficking, and she could hear women crying in the rooms next to her. Foley stated that in order to get away from Wanamaker, she told him she needed chap stick out of his vehicle. Foley took his keys and drove his vehicle into Maryland. Foley stated she was driving southbound US-301 and listening to the radio when she heard through a transmission on the radio that there was a person in the trunk of Wanamakers vehicle. Foley got out of the vehicle and opened the hatch to look for the body the radio was telling her about. Foley stated she saw a tube that led to the bottom of the vehicle that looked like someone would use to breath out of. Foley advised Wanamaker has not been physically abusive to her, but he has been acting weird in the week prior to this incident. Foley and Wanamaker are homeless and go from motel to motel when they find the money. Foley was sporadic and jumpy while speaking with me. I asked her if she was on any medication, she advised she takes depression medication, and she had not taken it that morning because she had been driving through the night. Foley also stated she is not on any drugs.  The vehicle was found on the shoulder of northbound US-301 in front of the Centreville Barrack. The vehicle was searched, no bodies were found in the trunk. No tube was found connected to the trunk either. Vehicle was brought back to the barrack parking lot.  Delaware State Police was contacted, they advised Wanamaker had already reported his vehicle stolen and provided Foleys name. Delaware was also given the information that Foley provided about the Motel 8. After a METERS/NCIC search of Foley, an active warrant was found in Worcester County, Maryland. Warrant was a hold without bond. Delaware was told Foley would be held at the Queen Annes County Detention Center, and they can find her there when they go further with the vehicle theft charges. Foley was also served two separate protective orders while being at the Queen Annes County Commissioners Office.  Wanamaker retrieved his vehicle from the barrack later that day.  Case closed.  All events stated in this report occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
