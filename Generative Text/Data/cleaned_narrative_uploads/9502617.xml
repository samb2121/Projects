         <NarrativeText>January 10, 2023 Case Number: 23-MSP-001183 Victim: Julian Pagan Body Camera: partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"&gt;https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=89b95744e9f24bc19c42a5871c26dd4dpartner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  Narrative:  On January 10, 2023, at approximately 1703 hours, I, Trooper Romeo, was at the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack where I made contact with the complainant, Julian Pagan (DOB: 04/19/2002). Pagan advised that on Friday he downloaded an application on his phone called Wizz. Through this app he met an account who he thought was a female. Pagan stated he gave the account his snapchat username, and continued talking with the person on there. Pagan stated the person he was talking with kept persisting asking for him to send them a picture. Then they started asking him to send them an explicit picture. Pagan did end up sending a picture of himself, as well as a picture of his genitals. After sending the pictures, the account immediately accosted him and blackmailed him to send them money. Pagan stated a random Instagram profile also started following him. Pagan advised they demanded $300.00, or they would leak the photographs he sent. Pagan stated he replied that he did not have the money, but would send $200.00. Pagan advised the snapchat handle was @kalarbooker and the wanted the money through cash app. Pagan stated the first handle for cash app was $ishmaelthagreat and when that one didnt work they stated to send the money to $Ricoking38. That attempt also did not work, so Pagan sent $190.00 via Apple Pay to 1 707-313-2421. He sent the money on January 6th. Pagan advised that they continued to harass him via text message, so he informed his mother of the situation. His mother canceled his debit card, through SecU bank in Salisbury, so that they could not use his information. Pagan is receiving text messages from  text-decoration:underline"&gt;john.karla1@icloud.com  His mother filled out an IC3 form on the FBIs website, and also has been in contact with a Kevin with Cyber Investigations. I emailed Kevin in regards to the case, and I am waiting on a reply. I advised Pagan and his mother to also contact the bank and inform them of the situation, even though they canceled his debit card, so they can be cautious of fraudulent activity. I provided Pagan with his case number.  After a response from Kevin in Cyber Investigations, he stated that they are conducting an investigation. With that I request this case be closed. </NarrativeText>
