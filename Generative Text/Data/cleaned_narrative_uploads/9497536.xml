         <NarrativeText>NARRATIVE:  On January 19, 2023 at approximately 1000 hours, I responded to23340 Red Oak Court California, MD 20619 and met with complainant, Lisa J. Walter, in reference to her daughter, Addisyn Pope Fedor (W/F DOB: 9/14/08). Walter advised Fedor had been involved in an online relationship with a subject whom she believed was an adult.   Walter stated she because aware of this relationship on January 14, 2023, because she received a random phone call from a subject in California. That subject informed Walter he was afraid of Fedors well-being because the suspect in the case has been carrying out the same type of enticement/exploitation to at least two other people. Walter advised the online relationship with the suspect began approximately 2-2.5 years prior. The name the suspect provided to Fedor was Yousef Mahmood. Fedor told the suspect she was 19 years of age, at the time they started talking. During this 2-2.5 year relationship, the suspect did learn Fedor was actually 12 years of age. One of Fedors friends was in contact with the suspect and informed him Fedor was actually 12 years old, at which point they continued to talk. Fedor and the suspect would chat via Discord and video chat calls. Discord is believed to be the application they first began talking on. The following name was associated with the Discord account: @Joker-sama. That name was located on the Discord server approximately two years prior. It was learned that Fedor gave the suspect access to all aspects of her life, including passwords and active locations off all family members. While searching Fedors email and Discord, an IP address was located, which appeared to be associated with a log-on attempt made by the suspect. The captured IP was 46.19.85.57. Also, while searching Fedors phone, videos which were sexual in nature were observed. Those videos had been sent to the suspect, as well. A review of the chat conversations between Fedor and the suspect were located. The suspect told Fedor he loved her, and they would be together in the afterlife. The suspect also indicated to Fedor they were going to have a baby and name it Lucifer.   Additional identifiers on the suspect were discovered on Fedors phone as well. They included Instagram user names: punpun12321 and mahmood12321. The following name and phone number were also located: Rami Levi (+97255-666-4029).   An open source search of the IP address,46.19.85.57, revealed it geo-located to Tel Aviv and the service provider is Pelephone.   A review of the Discord account did reveal multiple images which did meet the statutory requirement for child pornography. Two images are described below: - 1/8/2023 at 2121 hours: One color image of an exposed vagina. The female in the image is utilizing her fingers to spread her vagain. The image is reasonably believed to be of Fedor. -1/10/2023 at 0535 hours: One color image of a nude caucassian female which displays breasts and vagina, reasonably believed to be Fedor   Due to the aforementioned facts in this case, the suspect is believed to be living in a different country, which there is no jurisdiction. I request this case be closed.</NarrativeText>
