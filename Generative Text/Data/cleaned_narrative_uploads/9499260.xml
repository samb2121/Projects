         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-437 R MULLINS ID: 23-MSP-029262 Defendant: Ciara Gabrielle Mullins *****SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER***** TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On August 19, 2023 at approximately 0110 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of White Marsh Boulevard, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a tan Chrysler PT Cruiser failing to drive within a single lane and traveling below the posted speed limit. The Chrysler was bearing Maryland registration 6FD0816.    Left over dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Left over dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Left over dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Left over dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  Drove on dotted white lane line with the driver side tires.  43-MPH in a posted 50-MPH speed zone.  Left over dotted white lane line with approximately one-third of the Chryslers width.  Right over solid white lane line with approximately half the width of the Chryslers width.  Right over solid white fog line with the passenger side tires.  Emergency Lights activated.  Left over dotted white lane line with approximately half the width of the Chryslers width.  The Chrysler appeared to be traveling below the posted 50 MPH speed limit. I activated the front antenna of my Golden Eagle II Radar, which is a directional radar, in the moving mode (same). I heard a Doppler tone indicative of the estimated speed and obtained a speeding reading of 43 MPH in a posted 50 MPH zone (my radar unit was checked before and after my shift and was functioning properly). Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on Maryland 700 at Beacon Road.  The above referenced RADAR was calibrated before and after my shift and was functioning properly. I am a certified RADAR operator. This RADAR is specifically assigned to my vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Chrysler on the driver side and made contact with the female operator of the vehicle. There was a female passenger. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested her drivers license and vehicle registration. She failed to provide the vehicles registration. She was identified by her Maryland Identification Card as Ciara Gabrielle Mullins. While speaking with Mullins, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Additionally, I observed her speech to be slurred. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Chrysler and requested Mullins to exit her vehicle. She complied and exited her vehicle. Mullins dropped her lighter and stumbled while exiting her vehicle. While speaking to Mullins outside of her vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. When asked about her consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Mullins stated she had a shot of Titos (Vodka). I informed Mullins that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which she agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on a parking lot entrance off of Maryland 700. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. She appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. She was wearing a black top, shorts, and sandals.  I asked Mullins the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None. Physical Injuries  Mullins stated she had a bad leg due to a car accident. She stated she is not currently seeing a doctor and is able to walk. Medication  None. Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual.     Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.     Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Mullins stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Mullins removed her sandals.  Instructional Stage:    Broke the instructional position to the right on three occasions.  Walking Stage (1stNine):    Stepped completely offline on steps 2, 4, and 5.  Missed touching heel to toe by more than a  inch on steps 6 and 7.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Completed 8 steps instead of the instructed nine.  Turn:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Did not complete turn as instructed.  Walking Stage (2ndNine):    Stepped completely offline on steps 4 and 9.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Missed touching heel to toe by more than a  inch on steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Mullins stated that she understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. Mullins kept her sandals removed.  -Right foot raised.  Balance and Count Stage:  Second 0-10:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Swayed body to the left and right.  Seconds 11-20:    Swayed body to the left and right.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Placed raised right foot on the ground.  Seconds 21-30:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Swayed body to the left and right.  PBT #70005012: Refused.   ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Mullins was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0135 hours, I placed Mullins under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. She was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy and was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for further processing.  Upon arrival at the barrack, I provided Mullins with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Mullins was advised of her DR-15 Advice of Rights. At 0200 hours, Mullins refused to take a breath test.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****REFUSAL*****  Mullins was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
