Ref case 2LD0MDN  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On December 30th 2023 at approximately 0027 hours I, TFC Pinkney #6139 was dispatched to assist with a single vehicle collision on Baltimore Ave at Lincoln Ave in Beltsville, Prince Georges County Maryland. Upon arrival, I observed a Black Nissan Rouge bearing Maryland 8EJ0029 disabled in lane one on the southbound side of Baltimore Ave. The driver was seated in the passenger seat upon contact.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) Trooper Ngoushema made initial contact with the driver of the vehicle and spoke with her and a male subject that was with her regarding the collision. The male subject was later identified as Abimael Navarro (DOB: 05/08/1981). The female subject was identified as Laura C Quinteros Zuniga (DOB: 03/05/2000) by her Maryland Drivers License. Trooper Ngoushema gathered information regarding how the accident occurred and gathered the needed information to complete an information exchange form. Both Quinteros and Navarro were relocated to a parking lot directly across from where the collision occurred at. I then made contact with Quinteros Zuniga and obtained her insurance information for Trooper Ngoushema. While speaking with Quinteros Zuniga, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and or person. To assist with translation, I requested the assistance of Officer Paredes #4516 of the Laurel Police Dept for translation. Upon the arrival of Officer Paredes, Quinteros Zuniga was asked how much she had to drink. Quinteros Zuniga admitted to having one drink.  The test was performed in the Complete Auto parking lot. The lighting conditions consisted of the street light, my vehicles headlights, and my flashlight. My forward facing emergency equipment was deactivated during all test. The following questions were asked of Quinteros Zuniga prior to beginning the test.  Glasses or Contacts  None Medical Conditions - Allergies Injuries  None Medication  OTC medication  Quinteros Zuniga stated that reason she was involved in the collision was because of her eye allergies.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS 6/6 Clues The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Quinteros Zunigas eyes. Quinteros Zuniga was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes until told to stop. Quinteros Zunigas pupils were equal in size.  1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes 2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes 3) Onset prior to 45 degrees - Present in both eyes.  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus - Not observed  WALK AND TURN (6/8 clues observed) Quinteros Zuniga was instructed and demonstrated to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe in a straight line with her hands down by her side and to remain in that position until told to begin. Quinteros Zuniga was instructed to take nine (9) steps on the line, touching heel to toe on every step. She was then instructed to keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step out loud while keeping her hands down by her sides. On the ninth step, Quinteros Zuniga was then explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her right foot, to the left, to turn completely around. Quinteros Zuniga was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. She was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed; keeping her hands down by her sides, looking down at her feet, and to count each step out loud. Quinteros Zuniga was asked if she understood the test. Quinteros Zuniga stated, yes.  Instructional Stage: Separated her feet more than once.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): No clues  Turn: Did not complete the turn as instructed.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine): Raised her arms more than 6 inches away from her body. Missed heel to toe. Stepped off-line on the fourth step (she then backed up and started to count over again). She took 10 steps instead of the instructed 9.  ONE LEG STAND (1/4 clues observed) Prior to performing the test, it was properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Quinteros Zuniga was instructed to stand with her heels and feet together, place and leave her hands down by her sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised, he was to keep the leg that was raised, pointed straight, watch her raised foot, and to count out loud (one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand) and to continue counting until told to stop. Quinteros Zuniga was asked if she understood all the instructions of the test which she stated he did. Quinteros Zuniga raised her right foot.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: Raised her arms more than 6 inches away from her body Seconds 10-20: Raised her arms more than 6 inches away from her body Seconds 20-30: Raised her arms more than 6 inches away from her body  PBT: I offered Quinteros Zuniga a Preliminary Breathalyzer Test (PBT) on scene, which she agreed to take. The results of the test were .13.  ARREST: Based on the above listed clues, observations, and detections from Quinteros Zuniga, she was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. A search incident to arrest was conducted, no contraband was located. Quinteros Zuniga was then transported to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack. Upon arrival at the barrack, a secondary search was conducted, and no contraband was located during the search. Quinteros Zuniga was provided and read a copy of the DR-15 advice of rights via the Maryland MVA website. At 0140 hours, Quinteros Zuniga agreed to the intoximeter test.  Intoximeter Test: I conducted the 20-min observation period beginning with her arrest. The test was conducted by Cpl Williams of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. The test revealed that Quinteros Zuniga had a result of .13 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  Release: Quinteros Zuniga was released to Eli Obed Ramirez Salvador from the Barrack.

         <NarrativeText>LAURA CAROLINA QUINTEROS ZUNIGA 23MSP046037 Defendants Name: QUINTEROS ZUNIGA, LAURA CAROLINA Incident Number: 23MSP046037 Date of Offense: 12/30/2023 Officers Name  IBM: Tpr. Ngoushema#7453 Officers Training/ Experience Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Standardized Field Sobriety Test course June 2023. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On Sunday, December 30, 2023 at approximately 0019 hours, I, Trooper Ngoushema #7453 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack Q was dispatched to a call for service involving a single motor vehicle collision on Baltimore Avenue at Lincoln Avenue. Upon my arrival at the scene, I observed a black Nissan displaying a Maryland registration plate: 8EJ0029 in the middle of the roadway (suicide lane). I made contact with the female driver sitting in the front passenger seat and a male witness standing next to her. The female driver and the male witness were identified through their Maryland Drivers Licenses as Laura Carolina Quinteros Zuniga and Abimael Banegas Navarro. Since Quinteros Zuniga could not speak nor understand English clearly, I enlisted the help of Navarro to assist with translating from English to Spanish as well as Spanish to English. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) Through Navarro as the translator, I asked Quinteros Zuniga the following questions:   If she was okay and if she needed medical attention? She stated no.  What happened? She said lost control and hit the curb.  Where she was coming from and she was heading? She said work and was headed home.  Where she works and what shift did she work? She said a Los Amigo restaurant in Baltimore and worked from 1600 hours until closing.   margin-left:8px"&gt;How much alcoholic beverage did she drink prior to driving and what kind? She said none.  After the aforementioned questions and responses, Quinteros Zuniga asked me if she should could go sit in Navarros car across the street in the parking lot and I said yes. At this point, Trooper First Class Pinkney intervened and took over the investigation of the motor vehicle collision and subsequently placed Quinteros Zuniga under Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs). </NarrativeText>
