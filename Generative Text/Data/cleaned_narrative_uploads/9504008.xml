         <NarrativeText>Incident was recorded. Q-23 is MVR equipped. Body-worn camera is equipped.  Defendant: Pinkney, Arbreyon Latricia Nicole Date of Birth: 05/25/1992 Date of Arrest: 02/26/2023 Time of Arrest: 0306 hours FL License #: P525-012-92-685-0 DUI #: 23-046 TRAINING/CERTIFICATES Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 2/26/2023 at approximately 0212 hours, I, Trooper Gonzales #7442 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack was operating marked Maryland State Police vehicle Q-23 in the area of westbound US-50 and MD-295. I was responding to a call for service for a single vehicle collision in that approximate area. I observed fireboard on scene with two females and a black Nissan on the median of westbound US-50 and MD-295. The vehicle was subsequently located 600 feet east of their location, off the roadway from the westbound US-50 ramp to northbound MD-295. The vehicle was a silver Nissan Altima with front end and top damage as well due to being overturned as a result of the collision. The Nissan was bearing Florida registration Y67CZV.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I arrived on scene and observed two females and a black Nissan on the median of westbound US-50 and MD-295. I spoke to the females and one of them confirmed they were the driver and sole occupant of the Nissan; the other female was a friend and arrived after the collision occurred. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the first females breath/person. I requested the first females drivers license, which she presented. The driver was identified by her Florida license as Arbreyon Latricia Nicole Pinkney (B/F 05/25/1992). I also observed Pinkney to have glassy bloodshot eyes. A check through MVA revealed that Pinkneys driver license was valid. Trooper Harris #7179 and Officer Gogarty #277 of the United States Park Police arrived on scene to assist in locating Pinkneys Nissan as the area was canvassed by us three in an effort to locate it. As I interviewed Pinkney to better understand the specifics of the collision and where her Nissan was I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. Pinkney advised her Nissan was 600 feet east of our current location as she walked to our current location where she was spotted by fireboard. Pinkney then suggested walking me to her Nissan to better understand what occurred and where it is. As we were walking towards my vehicle approximately 30 feet east of where I was interviewing her; Pinkney briefly lost her balance and bumped into my right shoulder. Pinkney advised she was visiting and coming from her Godmothers who recently passed and going to her brothers house in Virginia. I asked Pinkney to come to the front of the US Park Police cruiser currently blocking lane 1 and left shoulder of westbound US-50 and MD-295. I asked Pinkney if she had anything to drink tonight to which she answered she did hours ago. She estimated her last drink was approximately 2130 hours and that it was one margarita. She also advised that it was at the Twisted Crab in Bowie, Maryland.  At that time, I asked Pinkney to perform standardized field sobriety tests to determine if she was safe to drive to which she agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the left shoulder of westbound US-50 at MD-295. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Pinkney appeared to be in good physical health and did not display any visible injuries. I instructed Pinkney to continue standing in front of the US Park Police cruiser.  I asked Pinkney the following questions: Glasses or contacts  yes  glasses for driving. Pinkney was not wearing glasses at that time. Medical conditions  yes  migraines. Injuries  none. If she considers herself a healthy person  yes.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus. It was held approximately 12-15 inches from Pinkneys eyes, slightly above her eye level. Pinkney was instructed to look forward, keep her head still, and follow the tip of the stimulus with her eyes and her eyes only. Pinkney was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Pinkneys pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes. Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes. Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes. Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was observed.  Walk and Turn (5/8 clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated. Pinkney was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe on a straight line. Pinkney was then instructed to remain in that position until told to begin. Pinkney was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. On the ninth step, she was instructed to keep her lead foot planted and take a series of short, choppy steps with her rear foot to turn completely around. After the turn, Pinkney was instructed to complete the second series of nine (9) steps in the same heel to toe fashion. Pinkney was instructed to keep her hands flat at her sides, keep her eyes focused on her feet, count every step aloud, and once she began the test she was not to stop walking until the test was completed. Instructional Stage:  Pinkney was observed wearing brown boots.    margin-left:8px"&gt;Cannot keep balance (two occasions)  Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Misses heel-to-toe (four occasions)  Uses arms for balance   margin-left:8px"&gt;More than nine steps (took 12 steps)  Turn     margin-left:8px"&gt;Incorrectly performed. (Did not keep lead foot planted, both feet came off the ground).  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):    Misses heel-to-toe (four occasions)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Uses arms for balance  One Leg Stand (3/4 clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised, she was to keep her leg straight, watch the raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand, one thousand one, one thousand two, etc) and to keep her hands down by her side. I asked Pinkney if she understood the instructions to which she states she did.  Instructional Stage:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing to report.  Seconds 0  10:    Puts foot down (one occasion)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Uses arms for balance (one occasion)  Seconds 11  20:    Puts foot down (two occasions)  Uses arms for balance (one occasion)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Sways (one occasion)  Seconds 21  30:    Puts foot down (one occasion)  Uses arms for balance (one occasion)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Sways (one occasion)  It is also to be noted that Pinkney did not count as instructed and demonstrated. Pinkney counted as one one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, etc. Pinkney also wasnt consistent with her counting as she counted 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 without thousand following those numbers while she was counting. While on scene, I informed Pinkney of her Preliminary Breath Test Rights. Pinkney was offered a PBT to which she refused.  ARREST Based on the totality of the circumstances, I had reason to believe Pinkney was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.    Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from person/breath.  Glassy bloodshot eyes.  Initial appearance of the scene to indicate alcohol was involved in a single vehicle collision.  Driver admitting to consuming a margarita hours prior.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Testing: HGN (6/6), WAT (5/8), OLS (3/4).  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Pinkney was driving under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a vehicle safely.  At approximately 0306 hours, I placed Pinkney under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. I immediately notified the College Park Barrack and searched her person for weapons and contraband, both with negative results. Pinkney was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and was transported to the College Park Barrack per department policy. Pinkney was read her DR-15 Advice of Rights in English from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration website and was also given a copy of the DR-15 in English to read along to. At approximately 0350 hours Pinkney refused to take an alcohol concentration test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Pinkney beginning on scene. Pinkney was observed from 0306 hours until the time she refused to take the test. The test was not conducted. Pinkney was processed and released to a sober driver with a valid license. Pinkney was issued copies of the following documents:    Citations  DR-15 Advice of Rights   margin-left:8px"&gt;DR-15A Order of Suspension.  Alldocuments were forwarded to the Prince Georges County, Maryland States Attorneys Office.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
