Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:  On October 1, 2023 at approximately 2358 hours, I, TFC Ramsay, was on patrol in the area of northbound US Route 13 and Maryland Avenue Salisbury, Wicomico County, Maryland.  At the above date and time, I observed a silver Toyota Camry bearing Maryland registration 4EF6327 appearing to be traveling above the posted 35 mph speed limit. Utilizing my radar, which was tested before and after my tour of duty and found to be working properly, I obtained a speed reading of 48 mph in that 35 mph zone. Shortly thereafter, I observed the vehicle cross over the solid double yellow line on the S turn by  the vehicles width before returning to its designated lane of travel. The Camry traveled another 5-7 seconds before negotiating another turn. This time the Camry crossed the dotted white line separating lane one from lane two by nearly  of the vehicles width. The vehicle attempted to correct itself, but instead crossed over the solid white line separating the left turn lane from lane one by half the vehicles width. As we traveled through the intersection of Carroll Street, the vehicle crossed the double yellow line before correcting itself. I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. As the vehicle turned right onto Main Street, it once again crossed double yellow line into the opposite lanes of travel. The vehicle took approximately 32 seconds to stop after I activated my emergency equipment.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact:  I immediately exited my patrol vehicle and contacted the operator of the vehicle Matthew Christopher Brown (W/M 12/30/2000), identified myself, advised the reason for the stop, and notified him that he was being audibly and visually recorded. While speaking with Brown, I observed his eyes to be bloodshot, watery, and glassy and his speech to be thick. There was a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from inside the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Additionally, I observed what appeared to be a beer in the drivers side door pocket.  Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening: I asked Brown if he wanted to perform standardized field sobriety tests. Brown agreed to perform standardized field sobriety tests. While speaking with Brown outside of the vehicle, the odor of an alcoholic beverage was again present, but this time it was coming from his breath and person. I again asked Brown how much alcohol he consumed and he advised he had a little bitlike two drinks. I asked him to elaborate on what kind of drinks and he stated mixed. He then quickly stated beersMillers, Natty Boh. Pre-Screening Questions:  I asked Brown a series of questions prior to performing Standardized Field Sobriety Tests: * Visual check of inside of Browns mouth: Clear * Glasses: Brown was wearing glasses. * Prescriptions: N/A *Injuries: N/A I then began Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and I started with the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus:   I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Brown. After explaining the test I asked him if he understood the test and if he had any questions. Brown stated he understood the test and began.  Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes *Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes   The test was concluded after lack of smooth pursuit due to the fact that Brown was not following my stimulus properly after being instructed several occasions on how to do so. Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues:2 of 6  Walk and Turn: Weather: Clear Surface: Asphalt surface free of debris   I instructed Brown into the instructional phase. I then explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn test to Brown. I asked Brown if he understood the test, and he stated that he understood. Brown began the test. Brown interrupted me on several occasions while I was attempting to give instructions Instructional Phase: Broke heel to toe instructional position Walking stage 1st9: Stepped off line: steps 2, 3, and 6  Turn: Incorrect; did not leave foot planted Walking stage 2nd9: Stepped off line: step 4 and 6   Total Walk and Turn Clues:3 of 8  One Leg Stand: I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Brown. I asked Brown if he understood the test and he stated he did.  Seconds 1-10: Put foot down Sway Seconds 11-20: Put foot down Sway  Seconds 21-30: Sway Put foot down Brown only counted to 24 on a 30 seconds test  Total One Leg Stand Clues:2 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test:    I explained to Brown the reasons for using a preliminary breath test, and asked if he wanted to submit a breath sample. Brown gave a breath sample of .16. Prior to giving the PBT, I asked Brown how many beers he had consumed and he stated, I dont know like 4 or 5. Arrest and Transport:   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Brown was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol  * Eyes watery, bloodshot and glassy * The odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle and his breath and person * Admittance to consuming alcoholic beverages * Observations during SFSTs   Brown was placed under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol at 0007 hours. On the way to the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack, the odor of an alcoholic beverage was present in my patrol car that was not there prior to the traffic stop.  20 Minute Observation Period:    Brown was read/listened the DR-15 Advice of Rights when we arrived at the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack. Brown agreed to submit to the intoximeter test at 0216 hours and signed the DR-15. Cpl. Weber of the Maryland State Police, who is a certified intoximeter operator, administered the test at 0042 hours. Browns breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .20 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Brown was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and was released.  I request this case closed. </NarrativeText>
