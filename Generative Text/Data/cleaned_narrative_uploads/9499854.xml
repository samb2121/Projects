         <NarrativeText>  On 07-07-2023 at approximately 0152 hours, I M/T. Gordy and Cpl. Meyers was dispatched to 12806 Ocean Gateway Unit #714 (Francis Scott Key Hotel), Ocean City, Worcester County, MD, 21842, regarding a disorderly subject.    Upon arrival, I made contact with Damien Demarco Harris. Damien Harris advised his brother Davaughn Jamaal Henderson, wanted to leave the Hotel they were staying at approximately 0130 hours, for unknown reason. Henderson wanted to leave the Hotel with his four-year-old son (Logan). Damien Harris and Hendersons mother, Alexis Harris was caring for the Logan. Damien Harris advised he had no idea why Henderson wanted to leave the Hotel. Damien Harris and Alexis Harris advised Henderson he was not leaving with Logan at 0130 hours. It was later learned that Henderson didnt possess a valid drivers license, nor did he have a vehicle. During my brief interaction with Henderson I smelled the odor of alcohol coming from his breath and person. Henderson later advised Cpl. Meyers and I, that he wanted Logan so he could leave his family and get away from the situation. Henderson stated, he just needed to leave the situation, however he wouldnt go into detail what the situation was. Alexis and Damien Harris advised that Henderson gets in these kinds of moods time to time, (worsens with alcohol). During my time with Henderson I asked him what his plans were, if Logan was in his custody, and Henderson was unable to give a valid answer. Henderson couldnt give me a clear answer or plans.    Contact was also made with Alexis Harris, and she advised that Logan was going to stay in her custody, due to Hendersons state of mind. Since Henderson is Logans biological father, contact was made with Brooke Bowers (Logans mother). Bowers and Henderson share joint custody of Logan. Bowers advised she wanted Logan to stay in the custody of Alexis Harris. Contact was also made with Department of Social Services and Mae Gunter responded to the scene. While waiting for Gunter to arrival, Hendersons mood changed several times. Henderson would cry for several minutes, then went on to ask if he could leave the scene, without Logan being in his custody. Henderson was advised that Social Services was responding to speak with him and other family members he became more agitated. Gunter implemented a safety plan, and it was agreed that Logan would stay in the custody of Alexis Harris by Gunter and Brooke Bowers. There is a Social worker assigned to Logan between Henderson and Brooke Bowers through the State of Virginia. Information was also obtained that Henderson suffers from mental illness and had attempted suicide on two different occasions. Henderson was not suicidal or a threat/danger to himself others while I was with him. Henderson refused to sign the safety plan.    Case closed. </NarrativeText>
