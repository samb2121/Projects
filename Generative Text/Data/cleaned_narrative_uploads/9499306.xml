         <NarrativeText>DUI Case Number: 23-176 / 23-MSP-034785 Maryland Drivers License: MD10272821409 Subsequent Offender: No Intoximeter Results: .17 BrAC This traffic stop was recorded on my body-worn camera and in-car-camera.  Certification and Training: - Certified RADAR/LIDAR Operator - Equipment calibrated and functioning properly (S/N: DE04161) - Certified in the administration of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests - NHTSA Certified Standardized Field Sobriety Test Instructor - Certified Intoximeter EC/IR II Operator - Completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driver Enforcement Training - Completed over 100 previous arrests for Impaired Driving Vehicle in Motion: On October 4, 2023, at approximately 0153 hours, I, Cpl. B. Meurrens #6372, was on patrol in marked patrol vehicle H-15, traveling south on Old Washington Road north of Pierce Road, Waldorf, Charles County, MD. While traveling south, I observed a vehicle traveling north with high beam headlights activated that were glaring in my eyes. The vehicle failed to deactivate the high beam lights projecting glaring and dazzling lights and continued traveling north on Old Washington Road past my vehicle. Once the vehicle passed, I was able to identify it as a blue Acura passenger vehicle through my side view mirror and observed it cross over the center double yellow lines into the opposite direction of travel by approximately one foot. I completed U-turn and conducted a traffic stop on the blue Acura TLX with Maryland registration 8EE2820. The Acura TLX came to a stop in the parking lot of 3261 Old Washington Road.  Initial Contact: I conducted a drivers side approach and identified the driver and sole occupant as Samuel Earl Linder (B/M 7/8/1983). I advised Linder of the reason for the stop, and he reached and deactivated the high beams. Linder responded by stating, I was going to my aunts house and going to my mothers house. Um, if you want to finish me you can right now because.... I have to be a better man, man... I was going home... and to be honest with you.... I dont want to do this. Linder further explained he was going to his aunts house to give her a bottle for her birthday. I noticed that Linder had glassy eyes and spoke with delayed and stammered speech. As Linder spoke, I began detecting the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. Linder continued speaking in a defeated manner and stated, You can go ahead and destroy my kingdom, and, Youre about to finish me... my life is over. Linder also advised that he was a CDL driver and asked to be let off today, which lead me to further believe he was aware of the circumstances and his level of impairment. I had Linder exit the vehicle and continued speaking with him. Linder advised he was going to his aunts house, and was at the liquor store prior to being stopped. Linder advised he had been drinking since 2200 hours on October 3rd. Linder again stated that I could, finish him, and he was about to be fired from his job. Linder got emotional and began crying, stating multiple times that I was going to book him while leaning on his car. I requested for Linder to completed Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) and he agreed.  Pre-Arrest Screening: After Linder agreed to complete SFSTs, I asked him how much alcohol he consumed, and he advised he had, two sips. Linder advised the sips were of Tequila, but was unable to elaborate further on how much he actually consumed. I asked Linder if he had any injuries or medical conditions that would impact his performance on SFSTs, and he advised he had a ball on his right foot, but that he was able to drive with his right foot and go to the weight room. The tests were conducted in the parking lot of 3261 Old Washington Road. The surface was paved, level and free from debris. At the time of testing, Linder was wearing a black tee shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes. The weather was clear and moderate temperature.  Test One - Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6 of 6 clues): Linder had difficulties following instructions and became visibly frustrated when I attempted to clarify that he understood the testing instructions. Linders head was tilted to the right, and he had to be asked to keep his head level. Linder was swaying in a circular motion throughout the duration of this test despite being told to stand with his feet together and arms by his side. 1. Linder displayed the lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. 2. Linder displayed a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. 3. Linder displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.  Test Two - Walk and Turn (Unable to complete): I attempted multiple times to place Linder in the instructional position. Linder lost his balance immediately each time before I was able to clarify to stay in the position. Linder got emotional again and stated that his mother was going to kill him and asked to call his grandmother. He was unable to focus on the instructions. After being given numerous attempts to follow instructions, Linder was not able to maintain any balance while I demonstrated the test and turned to his right and stated, man I fucked up, im fucked. I asked Linder if he was done, and he continued facing right without paying attention to the test. Linder was then placed in handcuffs and advised he was under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  Test Three - One Leg Stand: This test was not completed due to placing Linder under arrest during the Walk and Turn test.  Additional Processing: After placing Linder in handcuffs, he was transported to the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack. While being transported, Linder made the spontaneous utterance that he was a music artist and drank to defeat writers block. Linder advised that is why he was arrested. Once at the Barrack, Linder was read a DR-15 Advice of Rights and agreed to submit to the intoximeter test. Sgt. Esh was the intoximeter operator and the test was completed at 0316 hours. The results of the test were .17 BrAC. Linder was issued citations for projecting glaring and dazzling light, failure to drive right of center, suspended registration, uninsured vehicle, and DUI related offenses. Linder was released into the custody of a sober driver at the Barrack.  Case Closed by Arrest   </NarrativeText>
