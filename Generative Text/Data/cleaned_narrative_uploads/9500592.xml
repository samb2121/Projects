         <NarrativeText>DUI Case #: 23-96-092 MSP Case #: 23-MSP-014069 Suspect: Shirley Anne Bohn License #: MD-10273280493 DUI Citation #: 1Z00V1L Subsequent Offender: No Accident Involved:No Video: Maryland State Police patrol vehicle V-32 equipped with video recording equipment. Body worn camera also equipped. Involved Officers: TFC Brader, TFC Shubert, TFC Knopp  NARRATIVE  Phase #1  Vehicle in Motion: On April 20, 2023, at approximately 1750 hours, I, TFC Kreiling, was on patrol and operating marked patrol vehicle V-32 in the area of westbound Route 50 at the intersection of Route 346, Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland.  I was stationary in my patrol vehicle in the center median. I observed a silver sports utility vehicle, later identified a Saturn Vue bearing Maryland registration 5Z3609, traveling westbound on Route 50 as it approached my patrol vehicle from the rear. The Saturn then began to travel in the left turn lane and it slowed to a stop parallel to my patrol vehicle on the passenger side. I observed a female driver and a male passenger in the front right seat.  I began to roll my passenger side window down in an attempt to speak with the female driver. I then observed the female take her seatbelt off, exit the drivers door of her vehicle, and approach the passenger door of my patrol vehicle. The female driver was later identified as Shirley Anne Bohn by her Maryland drivers license. As she approached, she began to shout that she wanted the male in her car away from her as he was drunk and belligerent. Bohn spontaneously uttered that she had an alcoholic beverage and some of a second. She then stated I want this drunken idiot out of my car. I asked Bohn to move her car from the roadway as she was blocking the turn lane. She did as I asked and then I began to speak with her outside of her vehicle.  I asked Bohn what was going on and she explained that the male had taken them to have drinks. Bohn stated I had one drinks (plural) and about that much of a second drink as she held up her fingers to show a measurement. Bohn advised she was drinking whiskey and Coke. She went on to explain that the male, her boyfriend Robert Mack, had three drinks and that she didnt feel safe with him driving. She then stated Hes being a complete idiot and Im afraid of him. Bohn appeared to be very upset and irate about her boyfriends behavior. Bohn went on to rant about the living situation with Mack. While speaking with Bohn, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. I also observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I then briefly spoke with Mack and he was very calm.  I spoke with Bohn again and explained that I wanted to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Bohn was talking on the cell phone and stated It was a strong drink. The guy made them strong during her conversation. I asked Bohn what had led her to stop and contact me on the side of the roadway. Bohn mentioned that Mack was arrogant while they were at a restaurant earlier and Bohn kept mentioning past events or arguments with Mack. I asked Bohn if any argument turned physical today and she said no. I did not observe any signs of physical injury on Bohn or Mack. I asked Bohn how much she had to drink and she stated One and less than one third drink and stated it was blended whiskey. I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. Bohn voluntarily agreed to submit to the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and the first test I administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes  Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes  Bohn failed to follow the stimulus correctly and would move her head. Bohn also failed to follow the stimulus by looking straight towards me or looking in the opposite direction.  Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues:6 of 6  Walk and Turn Weather: Clear Surface: Paved surface free of any debris, slight incline  Instruction Phase - Bohn broke the heel to toe position and could not maintain balance  Walking Stage 1st9 - Bohn took 8 actual steps - Bohn raised both arms from her sides during all steps - Bohn missed heel to toe on step 2  Turn - Bohn did not pivot on her lead foot during the turn  Walking Stage 2nd9 - Bohn raised both arms from her sides during all steps - Bohn missed heel to toe on steps 3 and 4 - Bohn stumbled and stepped off line on step 7  Total Walk and Turn Clues:6 of 8  One Leg Stand Weather: Same as above Surface: Same as above  Seconds 0-10 - Bohn placed her right foot down - Bohn raised both arms from her sides - Bohn swayed in a side to side motion   Total One Leg Stand Clues:3 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test Bohn submitted a breath sample of .10 BrAC.  Arrest and Transport At 1812 hours, Bohn was placed under arrest and then placed in the front passenger seat of the patrol vehicle.While seated in the drivers seat of the patrol vehicle, I began to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present prior to Bohn being placed in the patrol vehicle. Bohn was transported to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack at 9758 Ocean Gateway, Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland. Upon arrival, I checked Bohns mouth and no foreign objects were located. A copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights was placed in front of Bohn. I then read the DR-15 form and asked her to follow along. Bohn advised at 1841 hours that she refused to submit to a breath test. I asked Bohn to sign the DR-15 and she did as I asked.  Bohn was charged with the following: 1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol 21-902(a1) 2) Driving Vehicle while Impaired by Alcohol 21-902(b1) 3) Negligent Driving 21-901.1(b)      </NarrativeText>
