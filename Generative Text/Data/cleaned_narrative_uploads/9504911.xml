         <NarrativeText>DUI stop 23-58-111 was recorded on body worn camera https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=1c192a60f5954f46b465fd1332f80a67partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1  No photographs were taken and uploaded to Veripic.  I have received the following training and certifications related to DUI/DWI detection: -Standardized Field Sobriety Test -Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement  I have been employed with the Maryland State Police since 2013 and have made over 100 DUI/DWI arrests    On 05/25/23 at approximately 1352 hours, I, TFC Lockhart (#6289) of the Maryland State Police was patrolling the area of Rt 50 and Dutchmans Ln in Easton, Talbot County Maryland. At that time I observed a black in color Ford truck with Maryland registration 7AL7538 pulling a dump trailer with a Maine registration of 267442C. The vehicle was observed W/B Rt 50 prior to the Easton Bypass (MD Rt 322) crossing in to lane #2 on multiple occasions. The vehicle would then make abrupt steering inputs, jerking both the truck and trailer back in to lane #1. I observed the vehicle cross in to the exit lane for Rt 322 then abruptly return to lane #1, still partially on the left shoulder at that time and running over the shoulder alerts (rumble strips). As the vehicle began to approach Dutchmans Lane, the speed limit lowers from 55 miles per hour to 45 miles per hour. As that vehicle entered in to the 45 mile per hour zone, it appeared to be traveling well above that posted speed limit. I then was able to get behind that truck and initiative a pace on that vehicle, where I followed it for approximately .2 miles where I maintained the same following distance, neither gaining nor losing distance on that vehicle. The vehicle was traveling 65 miles per hour in the posted 45 mile per hour zone. This was all consistent with my observations.  As we approached the red light at Dutchmans lane, I pulled up next to the truck, where I made verbal contact with the driver, advising him after the light cycled to pull on to the right shoulder when safe to do so. The driver indicated that he understood. The truck then went in to the right turn lane for Dutchmans lane, where it continued on to Dutchmans Ln and stopped in the travel portion of the roadway, rather than the available right shoulder past Dutchmans Lane as I instructed. I then made a drivers side approach, identifying myself and the reason or the stop. I identified the driver by his Maryland Drivers license as Thomas Patrick Whittingon (W/M, 09/01/1962). While speaking with Whittington, I detected a very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person. I also observed Whittington to have glassy, blood shot eyes. Whittington stated he was traveling from Ocean City back home to Sykesville, MD. Whittington stated his sister had passed, and he had her belongings loaded up on the truck and trailer that he loaded with the help of his other sisters. I did observe affects in the truck and trailer consistent with his story. When first asked how much he had to drink, Whittington stated Not much. Whittington also advised he was unaware he was unable to maintain a single lane while he was driving. Whittington when asked again about his alcohol consumption that day, stated he had one (1) Bloody Mary drink at approximately 1000 hours that morning. Based on my observations I had Whittington exit the vehicle for Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST).  NOTE: While awaiting the arrival of an additional unit, Whittington exited the truck and began walking around looking at the truck and trailer. Whittington had to be given the instruction again to remain in the vehicle.  Field sobriety tests were performed on Dutchmans Lane in front of Whittingtons vehicle where the pavement was flat, dry and free of any debris. Whittington was asked to remove his hat prior to attempting the tests. Prior to starting the tests Whittington stated that he does not wear prescription glasses or contacts (had non-prescribed reading glasses around his neck), was not taking any prescribed medications, and did not have any injuries. Whittington was asked to remove his during the tests. Field Sobriety was performed as follows:  TEST #1 Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)  1. Lack of smooth pursuit detected in both eyes 2. Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation detected in both eyes 3. Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees detected in both eyes  TOTAL CLUES (6/6)  TEST #2 9 Step Walk and Turn (WAT)  1. Started to soon (twice) 2. Unable to maintain balance during instructional phase 3. Stopped on steps 2, 4, and 8 of the first 9 steps and step 2 of the second 9 steps 4. Stepped offline on step 6 of the first 9 steps and step 6 of the second 9 steps 5. Missed heel to toe on step 9 of the second 9 steps 6. Wrong number of steps (took 8 steps for the first 9 rather than the instructed 9 steps.  TOTAL CLUES (6/8)  TEST #3 One Leg Stand (OLS)  1. Put foot down on count 2, and 20 2. Hopped on count 1 and 19 3. Swayed during entire test  TOTAL CLUES (3/4)  NOTE: Whittington counted 3 twice, and skipped from 12 to 15 (missed count 13,14).  Whittington was then offered and accepted to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). After retrieving the PBT, Whittington then elected to not take it. Whittington was then placed under arrest for DUI at approximately 1407 hours. When Whittington was placed under arrest, he stated no Im not. Whittington also when asked, refused to open his mouth to check for foreign objects and ensure he had nothing in his mouth. While Whittington was arguing about this, I was able to see in his mouth and was able to observed no gum, piercings, or other foreign objects in his mouth. Whittington was placed in a patrol vehicle where the DR-15 Advice of rights English audio was played from the Maryland MVA. Prior to placing Whittington in the patrol vehicle, I did detect that there was no odor of any alcoholic beverages in the marked unit. Upon arrival at the Barrack, as the DR-15 was being played with the drivers door open, I did detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle. Upon the DR-15 being played, Whittington advised he did not wish to submit to a breath test at 1415 hours. Whittingtons license was confiscated, a DR-15A was completed, and Whittington signed and retained all copies.  Whittington was released to a sober driver from the Easton Barrack on citations.  Whittington was found to be in violation of the following articles of the Maryland Transportation Code:  1. TA 21-801.1   Speeding (65/45) 2. TA 22.412.3(b) Operator not wearing seatbelt 3. TA 21-901.1(b) Negligent driving 4. TA 21-301(a)  Failure to drive right of center 5. TA 21-902(a1i) Driving under the influence of alcohol 6. TA 21-902(b1i) Driving while impaired by alcohol 7. TA 21-901.1(a) Reckless driving 8. TA 21-801(a)  Driving vehicle in excess of reasonable and prudent speed on highway 9. TA 21-301(a)  Following too closely 10. TA 21-201(a1) Driver failing to obey traffic control device  Due to the above facts I request the case be closed by arrest.  All events did occur in Talbot County Maryland.      </NarrativeText>
