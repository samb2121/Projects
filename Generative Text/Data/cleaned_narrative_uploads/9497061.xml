         <NarrativeText>THIS INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED ON L-18 IN-CAR CAMERA AND BWC #6931.   Scene Processing:  I surveyed the complainants vehicle which yielded negative results for any evidence of being shot at. No further scene processing was conducted.  Narrative:  On April 3, 2021, at approximately 0215 hours, I, Trooper First Class Brandon White #6931 responded to the Capital Beltway (I-495) South at Ritchie Marlboro Road, Prince Georges County, Maryland, in reference to an alleged vehicle being shot at.  The Maryland State Police College Park Barrack Communications received a call from Rasheed Hasan Mull, DOB: 04/20/1974, African American/male, who stated his tow truck was actively being shot at by another vehicle and the vehicle was still following behind him. Mull identified the suspects vehicle as a silver Honda Accord. Mull advised he was operating his tow truck in the area of the Capital Beltway South at Ritchie Marlboro Road, Prince Georges County, Maryland.  Upon my arrival to the area, I observed Mulls white ABC tow truck bearing Washington D.C. registration C77396 traveling south on the Capital Beltway at Ritchie Marlboro Road. Mull reported the alleged suspect vehicle to be a Honda Accord bearing Maryland registration 8CF3636. I observed the Honda Accord traveling south on the Capital Beltway in lane number two (2) in the area of Ritchie Marlboro Road. I began to follow the Honda as it traveled south on the Capital Beltway South, taking the ramp to Pennsylvania Avenue. Once on Pennsylvania Avenue, I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle upon the arrival of Trooper E. Lebga #7447.  I made contact with the driver of the Honda Accord, identified by his Virginia driver license as Malvin Howard, DOB: 12/10/1954, African American/male and detained him pending an investigation.  Upon Mulls arrival on scene, I did not observe any evidence of his tow truck being shot at. When asked, Mull initially advised the Honda Accord was being driven by the suspected alleged shooter. Mull then advised his vehicle was not shot at the time he contacted the police. He advised his vehicle was shot at weeks ago. Mull advised the Honda Accord and approximately ten (10) other vehicles were involved in the incident and were following him. Mull advised his tow truck was actively being shot at while traveling on the Capital Beltway, although there was no evidence to prove this to be true. He stated he only advised he was actively getting shot at because he believed he was about to be shot at.  After speaking with Mull, I made contact with Howard, who denied having any contact with Mull and advised he did not shoot at Mull or his vehicle. Howards vehicle and person was searched which yielded negative results for firearms.   Due to Mulls false statements, numerous police units responded for this call for service and an innocent citizen was stopped and searched. Mull was placed under arrest and charged with the appropriate charges for false report. Mull was transported and booked at the Upper Marlboro Department of Corrections Detention Center.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On 04/03/2023 @ approximately 0200 hours, I Sgt Jackson #4982 was serving in the role of the Duty Officer at the College Park Barrack for the Department of Maryland State Police located at 10100 Rhode Island Ave College Park Maryland 20740, I received a second phone call from a tow truck driver who was later identified by his Virginia drivers license as Rasheed Mull a 48 y/o male. During the phone call Mull, advised he was currently being chased and shot at by a group of vehicles on the outerloop of the beltway in the area of Pennsylvania Ave. Mull advised he was advised by the College Park Maryland State Police Emergency Dispatcher Sheila Fittzgerald # 4345,whom he had spoken with on his initial call to the barrack, to take the exit for Pennsylvania Ave to the Forestville Barrack, however he couldnt because the vehicles that were shooting at him were blocking the exit. Mull advised the drivers of unknown cars took these measures at exits 13 (Ritchie Marlboro Rd), 15 (Central Ave), and 16 (Arena Drive). While staying on the phone with Mull, I advised the Forestville barrack of his direction of travel, and advised Mull to take exit 17 (Landover Rd), and to get back on the beltway heading eastbound to the Forestville Barrack, which he did. As Mull exited off the beltway at exit 11 (Pennsylvania Ave) Mull then identified a silver/grey Honda Accord as one of the vehicles that he came in contact with.    Troopers from the Forestville barrack made contact with the driver of the Honda Accord, searched the vehicle with no weapons being discovered. It was then determined through continued investigation that Mull was not truthful in giving information relating to being shot at on this night. Mull was taken into custody and charged accordingly by Troopers from the Forestville barrack. All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.  .</NarrativeText>
