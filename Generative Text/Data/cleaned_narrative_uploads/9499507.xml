         <NarrativeText>B-23 // In-Car Camera Available / BWC Available  Assisting Troopers / Deputies: TFC. Devin #7046 and Deputy Alder #570 (BWC AVAILABLE)  ATTACHMENTS: - MVA Printouts - One (1) MSP Domestic Violence Supplemental Report (Form 246) - Digital photographs - MSP Form 63 (Property Record) - MSP Form 67 (Chain of Custody)  SCENE PROCESSING: I interviewed both parties separately, and determined who the primary aggressor was based on statements and witnesses. The suspect was arrested and transported to the detention center. A search incident to arrest revealed CDS paraphernalia. The below listed Physical Evidence was seized and stored at the MSP Frederick Barrack.  The victim completed a MSP Domestic Violence Supplemental Report (Form 246). The witnesses were contacted via telephone and provided statements recorded on my BWC. All forms are attached to this report. The victim was advised on protective orders, but refused.  VICTIM:Nikita Loraine Bible (W/F 08/17/1987)  DEFENDANT:Stephen Armand Fisher (B/M 07/12/1986)  NARRATIVE:  On 5/20/2023 at approximately 1151 hours, I responded to the area of westbound Interstate 70, and the 48 mile marker (MM) for a reported male strangling a female. Maryland State Police (MSP) dispatched advised they received several calls for two (2) subjects in a physical altercation on the shoulder of the interstate. MSP dispatch advised they were receiving reports that the two subjects were described as two males, and a male / female. MSP dispatch advised it was reported one subject involved was a black male, and the other was a white male (possibly a female).   I arrived on-scene at approximately 1157 hours, with Deputy Alder #570 of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office. I observed a female walking on the right shoulder, and a male walking on the left shoulder of the interstate, matching the description reported by MSP dispatch. I made initial contact with the female, identified as Nikita Loraine Bible (W/F 08/17/1987) by name, date of birth, and MVA photograph. Deputy Alder made contact with the male, later identified as Stephen Armand Fisher (B/M 07/12/1986) by name, date of birth, and MVA photograph.   I asked Nikita what happened. Nikita advised they were in an argument. I asked Nikita why they were arguing, and she advised it was a long story. Nikita advised they were waiting for their ride, and advised their ride previously left them at a gas station in Frederick, which was why they were walking west on the interstate towards Hagerstown. I informed Nikita it was reported that Stephen was strangling her and asked her if any assault occurred. Nikita initially advised no, and advised Stephen did not touch her. Nikita advised Stephen smashed her phone and threw it. I asked Nikita again if the argument ever turned physical, and she advised no. Nikita advised Stephen was just grabbing for her phone. I suspected Nikita was lying due to her demeanor, answers, and what was initially reported. Nikita advised Stephen would chase after her but continued to advise no assault occurred, and that she was not injured. I did not observe signs of physical injury on Nikitas person. Nikita advised she has been in an intimate relationship with Stephen, and that they have been sleeping in a friends vehicle. I captured digital photographs of Nikitas broken phone.   TFC. Devin #7046 then arrived on-scene to assist. Deputy Alder then informed me Stephen admitted that the argument was physical, and that he admitted to putting his hands around Nikitas throat amd squeezing 5 out of 10. Deputy Alder advised Stephen admitted he overreacted while speaking with him.   I then questioned Nikita again, and she then admitted Stephen did put his hands around her throat. Nikita advised she was not injured. I asked Nikita how long did Stephen have his hands around her throat and she advised not long. Nikita advised she did not have trouble breathing. I observed no signs of injury.   I then contacted Stephen, and asked him what happened. Stephen advised me about the argument, and that he grabbed Nikitas neck. Stephen advised he squeezed Nikita. Stephen informed me he takes medication to control his emotions, and that he has not been taking his medication. I asked Stephen what happened, he advised it was the phone thing man. While speaking with Stephen, I observed a white powdery residue on his face. I asked Stephen if he took anything, and he denied. Stephen then advised they were tussling and when he attempted to reach for the phone it fell out of her hand. Stephen advised during the argument was not trying to break her phone. Stephen advised I did grab her neck but advised he was not trying to hurt Nikita. Stephen was asked out of 1 - 10 how hard did he squeeze Nikita. Stephen advised about a 5.   I then placed Stephen under arrest at approximately 1220 hours. A search incident to arrest of Stephens person revealed a broken glass smoking device containing suspected Cocaine residue in his front pants pocket.   I identified the suspected controlled dangerous substance (CDS) paraphernalia through my training knowledge and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. Stephen was later advised of his Miranda Rights and waived them. Stephen advised the glass smoking device was used for smoking Cocaine. Stephen advised he last inhaled cocaine the night prior. Stephen advised again when he is not taking his medication, and it causes him to overact. Stephen advised he loves Nikita and that he did not try to hurt her.          I then transported Stephen to the Frederick County Detention Center for processing. While enroute, Stephen displayed drastic mood swings and began to yell at me.   I then contacted two (2) out of the three (3) complainants via telephone. It should be noted one complainant did not answer. Both complainants who were contacted requested to remain anonymous and will be referred to as WITNESS 1 and WITNESS 2. It should be noted the statements were captured through audio with my body worn camera (BWC).   WITNESS 1 advised he was traveling west on interstate 70, near the 48 mile marker when he observed a couple on the right shoulder in a physical altercation. WITNESS 1 advised he observed the male physically restraining the female. WITNESS 1 described the physical altercation as a bear hug and advised it looked like the male was attempting to get something from the female. WITNESS 1 advised the female looked in distress and the male looked angry.   WITNESS 2 advised he was also traveling west on I70, when he observed the male and female running across the interstate. WITNESS 2 advised the male was almost struck by a vehicle, and advised he had to swerve to avoid striking the male.  A voicemail was left for WITNESS 3. Further statements will be added as a supplemental incident report for (23-MSP-017978) if obtained.  It should be noted I asked Nikita where they have been sleeping during their travels, and she advised her friends vehicle. Nikita advised she lives in Cumberland, and she was trying to get Stephen to move back to Baltimore.          TFC Devin completed a MSP 246 (Domestic Violence Supplemental Report) with Nikita, and she did not assess as high danger. Nikita did not wish to speak with a Heartly House advocate, and became uncooperative after Stephen was placed under arrest. It should be noted Nikita did not want charges pursued.         I charged Stephen with 2ndDegree Assault, Malicious Destruction of Property, Disorderly Conduct, Disturbance of Peace / Hinder Passage, and possession of CDS Paraphernalia. Stephen was thenreleased to the custody of detention center staff for processing.  All events occurred in Frederick County MD.  CASE STATUS: Closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
