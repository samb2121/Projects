         <NarrativeText>MOBILE VIDEO RECORDING:   This incident was recorded on body-worn camera (BWC). Please contact Sgt. Twardowski #5675 for all video inquires.   VEHICLE IN MOTION:  This portion was not observed due to the nature of this incident.  PERSONAL CONTACT:  On 09/20/2023, I, Trooper Carpenter #7434 was responding to a separate accident when I observed a white Tesla Model 3 off the roadway and in the wood line on the ramp from Reisterstown Road to the Outer Loop of I-695.   Upon contact, I noticed the vehicles driver to be unconscious and still restrained by his seatbelt. I also noticed a large pool of vomit on the drivers right leg and on the center console of the vehicle. The vehicle was still in drive. I then asked the driver if he needed medical attention, to which he declined he did not. I immediately observed the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the drivers breath and person and his speech to be rambling, slow, and slurred. He declined medical treatment and I began my investigation into the crash.   The driver was later identified as Ryan Lee Taylor, (B, M, DOB: 06/21/2000). Taylor had told me that there was another person who was driving his vehicle, which I immediately debunked and stated how I had found him upon my arrival. Taylor had stated that he had gotten off of work at approximately 0100 hours after he was sent home. When asked the reason for getting sent home from work, he rambled a response that was incomprehensible and didnt make sense. I had asked him how much he had to drink prior to driving on two separate occasions. Both times Taylor did not answer. During the interview, I observed Taylors movements to be uncoordinated, slow and sluggish, and using the rear of the Tesla for balance as he spoke to me. I then asked Taylor if he would submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, to which he agreed.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING:  I began by asking Taylor if he was injured or had any prior injuries that would affect his balance, to which he replied he did not. He stated that he wears glasses but was not wearing them at the time of the incident.   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: INCONCLUSIVE//UNABLE TO BE COMPLETED  During this test, Taylor was instructed to stand with his feet together and his hands kept down by his side. He was then to observe the stimulus (my right hand index finger rested against the tip of a pen) with his eyes and his eyes only, and to not move his head. He stated he understood my instructions.  During this test, I observed Taylors eyes to be increasingly narrow as I continued the test. He stated that his eyes are narrow biologically, but they remained increasingly narrow as the test went on. I was unable to view his pupils or eyes fully during this test, and as a result attempted it a second time. During the second iteration, my flashlight was dimmed and the results were the same.  WALK AND TURN: 6 OF 8 CLUES  During this test, Taylor was instructed to stand with his right heel against the toe of his left foot and to stand with his hands down by his side. He was then instructed to remain in that position until I finished both my instructions and demonstration. He was instructed to take a series of nine heel-to-toe steps whilst looking down at his feet and counting the steps aloud. He was then instructed at the conclusion of the first nine, to take a series of small steps around his lead foot, and then go back the way he came in the same fashion as the first nine steps.   During this test, Taylor attempted the test but stopped after the turn and had asked me for clarification on the instructions. I demonstrated again, and he stated that he fully understood my instructions. He then began the test with the following results: Instructional Stage: -Lost Balance First Nine Steps -Stopped Walking       -Missed heel-to-toe -Stepped off line The Turn -Turned around without pivoting on his lead foot; lead foot did not remain planted.  Second Nine Steps -Stopped Walking -Missed heel-to-toe -Number of steps taken (10) ONE LEG STAND: 4 OF 4 CLUES  During this test, Taylor was instructed to stand with his legs together and hands down by his side. He was then instructed to raise a foot of his choosing approximately six inches off the ground and have it remain parallel to the ground all whilst looking down at his raised foot and counting aloud ( one thousand one, one thousand two, etc.) He stated that he understood my instructions and began the test.  0-10 seconds:       -Nothing to report 11-20 seconds: -Swayed, Hopped, Put foot down, and used arms for balance. Completely lost balance and used my vehicle to regain balance.  21-30 seconds:       -Put foot down  ARREST: Based on the following factors Taylor was placed under arrest for driving under the influence at approximately 0329 hours. -Single vehicle collision -Driver unconscious in the vehicle -Driver vomiting on himself and the vehicle -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person -Slow, slurred, and rambling speech -Uncoordinated, clumsy movements -Results of SFSTs.  Taylor was transported by me to the Golden Ring barrack. During the transport, Taylor was played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights form. He agreed to take an intoximeter test at approximately 0358 hours. Taylor then took the intoximeter test at the barrack conducted by Sgt. Fike #5926. The results of the test resulted in a BAC of .20 per 210 liters of breath. Taylor was issued all appropriate paperwork and released.   During the entire encounter, Taylor was cooperative and polite.   All appropriate paperwork will be attached to this report.   All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland  </NarrativeText>
