         <NarrativeText>THIS INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED BY MY BODYWORN CAMERA.  DWI 23-116 Suspects Information: Rodney Kenneth Pegues, B/M DOB 12/21/1965 Address: 3 Little Harbor Way Annapolis, MD 21401 Drivers License Number# PA Soundex 25108874  ATTACHMENT: 1. Accident Report  TRAINING CERTIFICATES: -Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police. -NHSTA certified to conduct field sobriety test (SFST) -Preliminary breath test operator certified - Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE).  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1): On 06/20/2023 at approximately 0002 hours, I was dispatched to the area of the ramp from W/B Rt. 50 to Rowe Blvd for a single vehicle collision. When I arrived on the scene, I observed a blue Saturn Vue bearing Pennsylvania registration LYB8268 with driver side front end damage facing the wrong way on the ramp.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2): As I exited my patrol vehicle, I observed a male sitting on the guardrail. He was later identified as Rodney Kenneth Pegues B/M DOB 12/21/1965 of Annapolis, MD. I made contact with the driver and asked how the accident occurred. Mr. Pegues stated that as he was traveling on the ramp the tire had blew on the vehicle causing him to lose control and crash. I observed Mr. Pegues eyes to be red, watery, and glassy. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his person. His speech was slurred and he displayed slow behaviors consistent with a driver who is under the influence of alcohol and or a controlled dangerous substance. Mr. Peguess vehicle had damage to the front driver side bumper and a flat tire. I asked Mr. Pegueswhere he was coming from and if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages prior to operating a motor vehicle. Mr. Pegues advised me that he had one Rum and Coke in a bar in Philadelphia about two hours ago. He further stated that he was coming from Philadelphia and heading home to Annapolis, MD.  Due to the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Mr. Peguess person, I asked Mr. Pegues to perform the Standard Field Sobriety Tests.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3): The test surface was dry and free of debris. The weather was clear and the testing area was illuminated by my flashlight and streetlights. Before administering the Standard Field Sobriety Test, I asked Mr. Pegues if he had any prior injuries that would prevent him from completing the tests correctly.  I asked Mr. Pegues the following questions: Glasses or contacts- Glasses (Advised he didnt need them for the test) Medical Conditions- Limited mobility in left leg Injuries- None Medication- Unknown pain pills for left leg.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed): The first test given was Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Mr. Peguess eyes. Mr. Pegues was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Mr. Peguess pupils were equal in size and had equal tracking.  1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes. 2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes. 3) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes. 4) Vertical Nystagmus- Present in both eyes   WALK AND TURN (Unable to complete):  I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Mr. Pegues was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and heel to toe touching. Mr. Pegues was instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin the test. Mr. Pegues was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Mr. Pegues was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Mr. Pegues was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Mr. Pegues was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Mr. Pegues was instructed once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count aloud each step. I asked Mr. Pegues if he understood the test and he stated, Yes. Mr. Pegues didnt perform this test.  ONE LEG STAND (1/4) clues observed: I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Mr. Pegues was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was instructed to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Mr. Pegues was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.  Mr. Pegues raised his left leg. 1. Swayed body at least 3 inches to the right during 21-30 Secs  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST: The Preliminary Breath Test was offered to Mr. Pegues on the scene. Mr. Pegues was advised that the test was not admissible in court. Mr. Pegues was also advised that the preliminary breath test was an additional test given from the Standard Field Sobriety Test. Mr. Pegues agreed to take a preliminary breath test with the result of .20 Brac.  ARREST: Based on my training, knowledge, experience with prior driving under the influence arrest, I placed Mr. Pegues under arrest for driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol at 0023 hours.I also observed four Olde English 800 beers in the backseat of Mr. Pegues vehicle. While enroute to the barrack I administered the 20-minute observation period. During the 20-minute observation period, I did not observe Mr. Pegues belching, regurgitating, or ingesting anything. At 0101 hours, the DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to Mr. Pegues via audio in English. Mr. Pegues agreed to submit to a chemical breathalyzer test with the result of .17 BRAC. The test was administered by Ofc. Ayers #6809 (Intoximeter ID 2962).  Mr. Pegues was given a DR-15, DR-15A, and Citations. Mr. Peguess license was not confiscated due to him having an out-of-state license. A copy of his DR-15, DR-15A and Intoximeter results were sent to the Motor Vehicle Administration.  DISCHARGE: Mr. Pegues was released to the custody of Thomas Smoot II.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
