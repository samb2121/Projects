         <NarrativeText>Narrative:    On 9/8/2023, I, TFC. Coss #6568, was dispatched to respond to the Victor Cullen Center located at 6000 Cullen Drive, Sabillasville MD for the report of threatening by a teacher to juvenile student. I made contact with the complainant Mario Monaldi who is the Assistant Superintendent with the Victor Cullen Center. I spoke with Monaldi by phone prior to arriving at the scene to get further details. Monadli advised that a student said they were threatened by a teacher earlier in the day, and he needed to report it to Maryland State Police.    I arrived at the scene and made contact with the Resident Advisor Supervisor Ayanna Morefield (Phone #: 240-675-4540) and the juvenile who made the complaint. The juvenile was identified as Shanna Nicole Duvall (DOB:3/3/2009). I introduce myself with Duvall and asked her to explain to me what happened earlier in the day. Duvall said approximately around 9:50 am on 9/8/2023, she was in history class. Duvalls teacher is Shelia Leatherbury. Duvall said she has never done anything to Leatherbury in the past and doesnt understand why Leatherbury always tries to cause issues with her. Duvall said during the class, she had already turned her day work in, for some reason out of nowhere, Leatherbury was arguing with her about not doing any work and said What do you want to fight? Duvall said she started to laugh and just talked to her friends and didnt speak to her teacher again. I then asked Duvall if anything physical happened. She advised nothing else happened and that she spoke to her chow supervisor at approximately 3:50 PM when the information was reported to Victor Cullen Staff.    Leatherbury was not at the center when I was on scene, so an interview was not completed with Leatherbury at this time. When talking to Monaldi regarding the situation, Monaldi said he did not have any footage due to the incident being only verbal, but he would provide further detailed paperwork for all involved in the incident.  Due to no crime being committed with this incident. I request this case be closed.  Case Status: Closed.  </NarrativeText>
