         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured by BWC. J-31 is not equipped with an in-car camera. Defendant: Muhammad, Rajaee Shakir Date of Birth: 03/12/1979 Date of Arrest: 5/18/2023 Time of Arrest: 0019 Hours DUI #: J-23-079 (Annapolis Barrack)  CERTIFICATION  TRAINING -NHSTA Trained/certified to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST)  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 05/17/23, at approximately 2319 hours I, Trooper Alvarado #7429, of the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack, was on-duty in uniform of the day operating Marked Unit J-31 when Iwas dispatched to the area of US-50 and Davidsonville Road in Anne Arundel County, MD for an impaired driver being followed by another driver with their hazard lights on. I observed a Gray Honda Odyssey bearing Virginia Registration TYH4165 traveling in lane 3 in the area of Westbound US-50 and Enterprise Road.I noticed that the vehicle was unable to maintain its lane, initially drifting into lane 2 before traveling along the right shoulder. I activated the emergency equipment on my patrol vehicle and initiated a lawful traffic stop.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2). I exited my patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver via the driver side window. The driver appeared disoriented and confused as he responded slowly and struggled to open the window. I deliberately looked into his eyes and observed that they were bloodshot red and glassy. I immediately smelled a strong odor of a suspected PCP (Phenecylidine) was emanating from his breath and person. Based on my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, I identified the distinct odor of the substance as a suspected prepense of PCP (Phencyclidine).I identified the driver by his Maryland ID as Muhammad, Rajaee Shakir DOB 03/12/1979 a black male. His wife and 6 month old child were in the front passenger seat with the child in the mothers lap. The child was not secured in a rear facing child safety seat. I asked Muhammad why he was unable to maintain his lane and he explained that he was driving that way due to the fact he could not find his way back home.  I then made contact with the witness, Kurt Nelson Brooks, who had been following Muhammads car, and identified him through his Maryland license with a date of birth of 07/25/1966. Brooks explained that he had been following Muhammads car since he left Washington D.C. due to his unsafe driving.While speaking with Brooks, Trooper Bowling #7419 of the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack arrived on scene.  I approached Muhammads vehicle and questioned him about his origin and destination. Muhammad informed me that he was coming from Washington D.C and trying to get back home. While speaking to Muhammad, I detected a faint odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and person, as well as a strong chemical odor emanating from his breath and person.His responses were slowed, slurred, and oftentimes incoherent when speaking.  Based on these observations, I requested Muhammad perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Test to which he agreed.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The test was performed on a flat surface and free of any debris along the right shoulder in front of Muhammads vehicle. I asked the driver the following questions: Any physical defects- No Sick or injured- No On any medication prescribed or recreational- No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The horizontal gaze nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST manual. I asked Muhammad if he understood the tests instructions and he replied that he did.  Muhammads pupils were equal in size and displayed equal tracking. I also observed Muhammad displaying a Lack of Smooth Pursuit, Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation and an Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. Muhammad displayed Vertical Nystagmus in both eyes.Muhammad displayed resting nystagmus, whereby his eyes displayed rapid and involuntary movement regardless of whether the pen was moving or stationary.Additionally, his pupils were extremely constricted.  WALK AND TURN (6/8 Clues observed) The test was explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST manual. I asked Muhammad if he understood the instructions and he replied that he did.  Instruction phase: *Cannot keep balance  he was unable to keep his balance on a few occasions and stepped out of the instructional position.  First 9 steps: Missed all heel-to- toe steps.  On step #4 he was explained to count aloud and then stopped for 10 seconds before continuing to not count for 3 more steps.  He then counted aloud 9 more steps, missing heel-to-toe on each and not walking in a straight line.  He was unable to complete the turn.  Second set of 9 steps was not completed.  He stated that he was done with the test after the first set of 9 steps.  ONE LEG STAND (3/4) Clues observed  The test was explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST manual. I asked Muhammad if he understood the instructions and he replied that he did. He raised his left foot.  Muhammad continuously repeated the phrase one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three in a repetitive manner, without progressing beyond those numbers or counting in a sequential manner.  He put his foot down 4 times before the 20 second mark.  During the test he was swaying to the left and right in order to control his balance.  His hands moved from the side of his body and ended up in front of his legs to maintain balance and stability.  He lost balance at the end of the test and fell to the ground. He was assisted back to his feet.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST PBT was not offered.  ARREST Based on the following, I had reasons to believe that Muhammad was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of either a controlled dangerous substance or alcohol.  *Strong odor of a controlled dangerous substance emanating from his breath and person. * Faint odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. *Slow, slurred, and oftentimes incoherent when speaking. *Bloodshot red and glassy eyes. * HGN 6/6 clues detected. * Walk and Turn 6/8 clues detected. *One Leg Stand 3/4 clues detected.  I arrested Muhammad for driving while impaired at 0019 hours. Muhammad was transported to College Park Barrack for processing. While he was inside my patrol vehicle, the entire vehicle smelled like the odor of a controlled dangerous substance.  At the College Park Barrack Muhammad was read the DR-15 Advice of Rights in its entirety. After the DR-15 Advice of Rights, Muhammad agreed to submit to the chemical breath test and signed the DR-15 at 0049 hours. The test was administered by Sgt. Jackson #4982 with a result of .00 BrAC at 0104 hours. A drug recognition expert, Sgt. Bishop #6032, was called to the College Park Barrack. Muhammad was read his Miranda rights and he refused to waive them. A blood draw was also refused by Muhammad.  After consultation with Sgt. Bishop, Muhammad was issued all appropriate citations and paperwork. Muhammad was then released to a sober driver at the College Park Barrack.  All events occurred in both Anne Arundel County, Maryland and Prince Georges County Maryland.  Cleared by arrest. </NarrativeText>
