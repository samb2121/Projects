         <NarrativeText>Narrative DWI Case Number: 23-132 / 23-MSP-026963  Maryland drivers License: P-625390041734  Subsequent Offender: No   Preliminary Breath Test: Refused   This incident was recorded on In-Car and assigned body worn camera.  Certificates and Training:  *Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police.  *Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement through Charles County Sheriffs Office.  Vehicle in Motion:  On 07/30/2023 at approximately 0157 hours, I, Tpr. Fuller #7440 of the Maryland State Police La Plata H Barrack, was on patrol north bound Route 301, in the area of VFW road, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland, in my MSP marked unit, H-30. I observed a Black Honda CR-V, with two inoperable taillights bearing Maryland registration, 3EA8827 traveling northbound Route 301, in the area of VFW road, Waldorf, Charles County, Maryland. The vehicle was traveling in lane three. I observed the driver who was later identified by his Maryland Drivers License as, Pearson, Jeffrey Albert (A.A/M DOB:09/22/1981) cross into lane two with the front and rear driver side tires one time before reentering lane three, Pearson then crosses into the right turn lane with both the front and rear passenger side tires. Pearson then crossed into the lane two again with both front and rear driver side tires. Without losing sight of the vehicle, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle north bound Route 301 just south of Substation road. The vehicle came to a complete stop north bound Route 301 in the area of Mattawoman Beantown road. At the time of the stop, it was not raining, and the roadway was dry.  Personal Contact:  I made contact with Pearson who was the driver of the Black Honda CR-V. I advised Pearson for the reasons of the stop. Pearson stated I dont know my taillights are out okay. Pearson was asked where he was coming from, Pearson stated he was coming from the Green Turtle (6 St Marys Ave ste 104, La Plata, MD 20646) for a party. As I spoke with Pearson, I observed hiseyes to be glassy and bloodshot, his speech was slurred and mumbled, and he had a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I asked Pearson if hehad anything to drink. Pearson stated, No. I requested for Pearson to hand me his license and registration, Pearson initially responded with handing me a visa credit card I requested Pearson to complete field sobriety tests and heagreed. prior to exiting the vehicle Pearson initially said that he did not want to get of the vehicle because he was in a lose lose situation. As Pearson stepped out of his vehicle he stumbled and fell into his driver side door with his right side.  Pre-Arrest Screening:  I asked Pearson if he had any injuries or medical conditions and he advised he did not and considered himself to be a healthy person.  I am trained in the administration of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. I have also completed Advance Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement training. I utilized my training in numerous prior DUI arrests involving impairment by alcohol.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Pearsons eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping hishead still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with hiseyes until told to stop. Hispupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. Hewas positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Pearson was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes. Pearson had to be reminded and corrected on keeping his head still through the entire test. Pearson was asked to remove his glasses for this portion of the test.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes  4.) Vertical Nystagmus  None   WALK AND TURN (8/8 clues observed)  Prior to Pearson performing the test, Iexplained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Pearson was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed and demonstrated to place hishands flat at hissides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Hewas advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Hewas instructed to keep hishands flat at hissides, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Pearson was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with hisrear foot to turn completely around. Pearson was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Hewas instructedonce he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hissides, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud. Pearson was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, Yes.  Instructional Stage:  Failed to remain in the instructional position. Pearson lost balance while in the instructional position one time while the test was being explained and demonstrated.  Started to soon. Pearson attempted to start the test before being instructed to do so two times.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):  Use arms for balance. Pearson raised both arms for more than six inches for all nines steps.  Missed heel to toe. Pearson failed to take heel to toe steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 by more than half an inch.  Incorrect number of steps. Pearson took 17 steps before turning after stating he understood the test.  Stepped off-line Pearson stepped off-line on steps 1 and 4.  Turn:  Improper turn. Pearson did not leave his lead foot planted and shuffle his feet while making the turn.  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  Stopped during the test. Pearson stopped after making his improper turn to ask multiple questions about the test for approximately 2mins and 25 seconds.  Use arms for balance. Pearson raised both arms for more than six inches for all nines steps.  Missed heel to toe. Pearson failed to take heel to toe steps 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 steps by more than half an inch.  Stepped off-line. Pearson stepped off-line on steps  Incorrect number of steps. Pearson took 18 steps on his 2nd sets of nine  ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed)  Prior to Pearson performing the test, Iexplained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Hewas instructed to stand with hisheels together and hands down by hissides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of hischoice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While hisleg was raised he was to keep hisleg straight, watch hisraised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop.  Instructional Stage:  Pearson refused to take this portion of the test.  Balance and Count Stage:  Pearson refused to take this portion of the test.   While on scene, Pearson was offered a preliminary breath test. Pearson Refused to take a preliminary breath test.      ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Pearson was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   -Strong odor of alcoholic beverage on breath.  - Dissociative behavior  -Glassy and bloodshot eyes.  -Mumbled and slurred speech.  -Clues during Field Sobriety Testing.  - Inability to drive in a single lane for any significant amount of time  Due to the number of observations, I concluded Pearson was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0227 hours, I placed Pearson under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Pearson was placed in the front passenger seat of my MSP assigned vehicle, H-30 per department policy. Pearson was transported to the Maryland State Police La PlataBarrack for processing. During transportation to the barrack. While processing Pearson I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath, and Pearson speech continued to be slurred and mumbled. I observed Pearson eyes continue to be glassy and bloodshot during processing. During processing Pearson fell asleep for the majority of processing. Pearson was then transported and released to the care of the Charlies County Detention Center.  The DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to Pearson at which time he refused to take at approximately 0250 hours.  Pearson was given copies of all pertinent paperwork.  All events occurred in CharlesCounty, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
