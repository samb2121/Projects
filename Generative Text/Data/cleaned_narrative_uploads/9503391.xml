         <NarrativeText>S-43 IS EQUIPPED WITH A CAMERA BODY CAMERA OPERATIONAL Case #: 23-MSP-009024 Defendant: Stephen Winder (B/M 12/25/1976) Vehicle: GA RMJ4614, Black Chevy Silverado DUI #: S-23-024  Training and Certification - Trained and certified to administer standardized field sobriety tests by the Maryland State Police in accordance with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). - Trained and certified in Advanced Roadside Impairment Detection Enforcement (ARIDE) in accordance with NHTSA. - Attended 2019 Maryland Impaired Driver Conference. - Attended training held by Maryland State Police SPIDRE Team  Vehicle in Motion (Phase One)  On 3/11/2023 at approximately 2204 hours I, TFC Barbiche #6649 with the Maryland State Police, was patrolling the area of N/B 301 and John Brown Rd in Queen Annes County, MD. I observed a black Chevy Silverado bearing GA RMJ4614 travelling in lane two. While behind the vehicle in lane one I observed the Chevy cross the right fog line and ride on the fog line for several seconds before correcting. I also observed the Chevy abruptly tap its brakes before accelerating behind the vehicle in front of it. I moved behind the Chevy and observed the Chevy drifting to the right within the travel lane before abruptly tapping its brakes again. The Chevy again drifted over the fog line before correcting then crossing the right fog line one more time. I subsequently activated my emergency equipment to effect a traffic stop on the Chevy. The Chevy pulled over on the right shoulder.  Personal Contact (Phase Two)  I made contact with the driver, Stephen Winder (B/M, 12/25/1976), who was identified by a Georgia license. I advised Winder why I stopped him. He advised he was tired. While speaking to Winder I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I also observed Winders eyes to be glassy. I asked Winder if he had anything to drink, and he said no. Winder was holding a lemon half as well. I did request for Winder to exit his vehicle which he agreed to, saying I would love to. Winder agreed to standardized field sobriety testing. Winder reiterated that he hadnt been drinking and doesnt drink. Winder was still holding a lemon he had been eating/sucking on which I requested he put in his pocket. Winder advised he had no eye problems. Winders pupils did appear constricted as well. While separated from the vehicle I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Winders person.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase Three)  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus - (0/6 clues)  No clues of nystagmus observed. Eyes were observed as glassy with constricted pupils.  Walk and Turn (3/8 clues observed)  I explained and demonstrated the test to Winder. Winder advised he cant walk with his feet straight. He advised he had no injuries or walking problems.  Instructional Stage - nothing observed  Walking Stage (First Nine) - raised arms away from body right away, had to be told to put arms down. - stopped at turn, had to be told to turn.  Turn - incorrect, did not keep lead foot planted and took a series of steps with both feet to turn.  Walking Stage (Second Nine) - raised arms more than six inches to correct balance  One Leg Stand (3/4 clues observed)  I explained and demonstrated the test. Winder stated Im old, I dont work out....  Balance and Count Stage 0-10 Seconds - put foot down quickly after raising it losing balance - Raised arms away from body more than six inches - swayed off center 11-20 Seconds - Raised arms away from body more than six inches 21-30 Seconds - Raised arms away from body more than six inches - swayed off center  It should be noted that Winder started off counting then stopped and did not start counting out loud again until I reminded him to.  After the test Winder immediately stated Like I said, I didnt get no sleep. Winder denied taking any medications or any other drugs. Winder reiterated that he doesnt drink. Winder also stated he had only been driving for 45 minutes since leaving Baltimore.  Based on all of my observations during the stop and SFSTs I placed Winder under arrest for driving under the influence/driving while impaired. Winder was transported to the Centreville Barrack where he was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights. Winder agreed to the breath test which yielded a .00 BrAC. The test was run by Sgt. Bolduc #4889. It should be noted that Winders breath samples were as follows, 1) .010 BrAC, 2) .009 BrAC which indicates that Winder had consumed alcohol at some point. I subsequently read Winder his Miranda Rights. Winder elected to continue speaking with me without a lawyer. I asked Winder if he would be willing to meet with a Drug Recognition Expert who would conduct additional tests. Winder refused the DRE. Based on my observations from this incident I determined Winder was impaired by a controlled dangerous substance.  Winder was issued citations for driving while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, reckless driving, negligent driving, amd failure to obey a traffic control device. He was also provided copies of all pertinent paperwork and released to a ride from the Barrack. Winder was polite and cooperative during his time in custody.  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, MD  Case closed by arrest.                </NarrativeText>
