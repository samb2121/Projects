         <NarrativeText>P-4 is not equipped with a mobile recording device  DUI-23-180  Defendant: Jones, Daryl Anthony  Date of Birth: 10/10/1974  Date of Arrest: 12/06/2023  Time of Arrest: 2151  Maryland Soundex: MD 10273147022  Stop was recorded on BWC  Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1)  On Wednesday, Decemeber 06th , 2023 at approximately 2115 hours, I was dispatched to a single vehicle motor vehicle collision in the area of South bound 295 just North of 695 Linthcum, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. When I arrived on scene I observed a vehicle in to a ditch. The vehicle was a 2013 white Lexus RS bearing Maryland registration 8EA9374 with heavy front end damage. I made contact with the paramedics on scene and they advised they were treasting the driver for diabetic reasons. While the driver was being treated I made contact with a witness on scene identified by her Maryland Soundex as Eryn Elizabeth Tolbert W/F D.O.B 3/31/1999. Tolbert advised they were behind the suspects vehicle. Tolbert advised the vehicle was in ln1 and made a sharp right turn crossing lanes 2 and 3 and striking the ditch. After speaking with the witness Cpl Swigert asked me to come back to where the ambulance area is. Paramedics advised Cpl Swigert that the drivers blood sugar was now fine and still showing obvious signs of impairment.  Personal Contact (Phase 2) I made contact with the driver and as he was about to come out of the ambulance and he showed poor display of balance. I was able to observe as the driver was about to exit the ambulance that he had urinated on his boots while trying to urinate in a container. The drivers eyes were bloodshot. While walking the driver towards my vehicle, I had to hold on him due to his poor balance and him possibly falling over. The driver was identified by his Maryland ID as Daryl Anthony Jones B/M D.O.B 10/10/1974. While explaining to Jones we would be conducted SFSTs I was able to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath.  Pre- Arrest Screening (Phase 3)The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder. The ground was dry at the time the skies were clear. The road was level and free from any debris. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests and I used my flashlight to assist with illumination. I asked Jones to perform three Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and the following was observed: Jones would briefly speak to me and showed slurred speech. Test #1 Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues)    Lack of Smooth Pursuit  present in both eyes  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes  Onset Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees  Present in both eyes   Test #2 (Walk and Turn) 5/8 clues present: Prior to Jones performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Jones was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. He was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. He was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Jones was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Jones was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. He was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud.   Instructional Stage:    Broke starting position three   Walking Stage (1st Nine):    Took 12 steps  Stopped briefly to tell me what step count he was on  Missed heel to toe all 1-10 and 12   margin-left:8px"&gt;Stepped off line 1,2,5 and 7  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):     margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Took 10 steps   margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Missed heel to toe step 10  Turn:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Nothing to report  Test#3 (One Leg Stand) (0/4 clues observed): Prior to Jones performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. He was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Jones was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated Yes. I was forced to stop this portion of testing due to safety concerns for Jones and his high intoxication levels.   Based off of the following I believe Jones was under the influence of alcohol:    Failing to remain in designated lane and crashing  Bloodshot eyes  Slurred speech   Strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath  Poor mobile coordination   margin-left:8px"&gt;Poor SFSTs  Jones was offered the opportunity to submit to a Preliminary Breath Test. Jones declined to take PBT. I then placed Jones under arrest for DUI. Jones was transported to the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for processing. While in my vehicle I asked Jones where is he coming from tonight. Jones replied, Home. I asked where was he going too. Jones replied, Home. While driving to the barrack Jones drifted over in his seat for far to the left his head was now on my right arm as he was falling asleep.  Jones was read his DR15 Advice of Rights at 2208 hours. Jones did not agree to submit to the intoximeter test. Jones was asked several times about his wifes phone number and was unable to provide it. Jones would then claim he saw his wife in the building that he seen her in this building. Jones would then advise that he is happy drunk. Jones would then state he cant get any drunker then this and he cant get any sober then this.  Jones was issued several citations and given all paper documentation.   Jones was placed in the car of his wife.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
