         <NarrativeText>  On September 28, 2023 at approximately 1448 hours, I, CPL Buckius #5742 of the Maryland State Police currently assigned to the Queen Annes County Drug Task Force executed a court authorized search and seizure warrant at 703 Shi Ln Stevensville, MD 21666.The warrant was signed by the Honorable Judge Kratovil of the Queen Annes County District Court. The warrant was for the exterior/yard of the property for marijuana plants.    Upon arrival, I made contact with Raymond Edward Gill. I identified myself and explained the warrant to him. I provided him with a copy of the search warrant and a copy of statute 5-601.2 which pertains to the laws regarding manufacturing of marijuana. I located six mature marijuana plants in a garden which was located in the backyard. I also located six small marijuana plants in individual pots on the rear patio area.Gill stated the smaller plants were for seeds only because of the costs marijuana seeds are. Gill stated he will be attempting to obtain his medical marijuana card in the near future. All twelve marijuana plants were seized and transported the Queen Annes County Drug Task Force for processing. The seized marijuana plants were processed and held under property held P-345817. The marijuana plants will be destroyed per MSP policy. I consulted the Queen Annes County States Attorneys Office regarding this case. It was determined no charges would be filed regarding this case.    I request this case be closed.    All events did occur in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
