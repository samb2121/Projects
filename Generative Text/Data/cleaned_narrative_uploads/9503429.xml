         <NarrativeText>Investigators received Cybertip #145951724 from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and in the Cybertip Facebook reported possible solicitation for child pornography. There were five images provided in the Cybertip, but none depicted child pornography or self production of child pornography. The images provided in the Cybertip showed profile pictures or adult pornography. A portion of the chat messages soliciting pictures of the alleged 15 year old victim was also provided in the Cybertip. The Cybertip also reported that the account used to solicit the images was based in Nigeria.  Investigators were able to determine that the child victim had reported to Facebook that he was 15, but his correct age was 11. Investigators were able to determine that the child was enrolled at St. Michaels Elementary school, and contact information for his parents was provided by Talbot County School student services.  Contact was made with the childs mother and arrangements were made for her and the child to meet with investigators at the Easton Barrack. On 1/26/2023 at 1500 hours, investigators met with the child and his mother. Safe practices for using the internet were discussed as well as the importance of being aware of potential grooming and solicitation practices. The Cybertip has been attached to this report.  Case CLOSED with a safety talk. </NarrativeText>
