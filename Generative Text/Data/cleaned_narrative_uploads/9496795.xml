         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack E   Incident: MDOP, Police Information  Location: 512 South Curlew Road Salisbury Wicomico County Maryland  Victim: Walter Lewis Matthews (2/12/1951)  Body Camera Link:https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=f3d1dfbddcd54b55a1374ce85494fee5partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1    Narrative  On 3/24/2022 at approximately 1733 hours, I TFC Huntington of the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack, responded to 512 South Curlew Road Salisbury, Wicomico County Maryland in reference to an open door at a residence. When I arrived on scene, I met with Walter Lewis Matthews. Matthews stated he had left his residence at approximately 0820 hours on 3/24/2023 and had returned at approximately 1730 hours. After Matthews entered his residence, he went to open a rear door when he noticed a knife fall from the door jamb. At that time, Matthews called the police. After Troopers arrived, we cleared the house to verify no one was hiding in the residence. Matthews walked through the residence after it had been cleared to verify that nothing was stolen.  Nothing was stolen, but a window on a back bedroom was broken, it was apparent a window ac unit had been pushed out of a window, and replaced. There was black spray paint on a mirror in the back bedroom, on a vaseline container in that same bedroom, and the name Tishina spray-painted on the side of the exterior of the house by the rear window that had been broken out. The mirror that was painted had a heart with a question mark under it.  Matthews advised Tishina is his daughters name. Matthews called her and let Troopers ask her questions. Tishina stated she had lived at South Curlew up until last August, when she moved out and now lives in Baltimore. She did advise her mothers house had been broken into a few days prior by her brother, Michael Louis Matthews. Tishinas mother lives down the road from Walter.  After speaking with Tishinas mother, and Walter, they both believe it was Micheal that did the damage to Walters residence. Walter advised Micheal is schizophrenic, and has medication he is supposed to take but does not take them.  A neighborhood check was completed with no one seeing anything. The one neighbor has cameras, but it does not catch Walters residence.  Walter does not want to pursue any charges, especially if it is his son Michael.  Walter was given the case number for insurance purposes. He was advised of the status of the case.  I attempted to located Michael at his last known address on Tuscola.  I request this case be closed since the victim does not want charges.  CASE CLOSED</NarrativeText>
