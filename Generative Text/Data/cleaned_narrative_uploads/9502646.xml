I recognized the substances to be Controlled Dangerous Substances through my training and experience with the Maryland State Police. The items were seized, captured on MSP Form 67 and 63 (P-323239), and placed in the MSP Westminster Barrack Evidence locker in accordance with MSP policy and procedure.  Neighborhood Check:  None completed due to the nature of the incident.  Narrative:  Reason for contact:  On 02/06/2023, at approximately 0106 hours, I was in uniform, on duty, operating a marked MSP Patrol vehicle: G-39. I was traveling W/B MD 26 W/O Hooper Rd, Carroll County, MD. I was utilizing a Kustom Golden Eagle II set # 39 (see above listed training and qualifications). I observed a vehicle, described as gray 2015 Chevy Camaro traveling E/B MD 26. The vehicle was the 2nd vehicle of two traveling E/B MD 26. The RADAR unit was activated and I obtained a speed reading for the vehicle for 73 mph in the posted 55 mph zone. When the speed was captured, the Chevy was the only vehicle in the field of influence for the RADAR unit (front antenna, opposite direction moving mode. I executed a U-turn, got behind the vehicle, and initiated a traffic stop. The vehicle was displaying Maryland registration A266185. I was also able to observe the driver was the sole occupant of the vehicle.  Contact:  I made contact with the driver, identified myself, advised the stop was being recorded, and stated the reason for the stop. I immediately detected the strong odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. I recognized the odor to be that of marijuana (a Controlled Dangerous Substance of Schedule 1) through my training, knowledge, and experience with the Maryland State Police. The driver provided the vehicle registration card, and his Maryland drivers license. The driver was identified to be DANEZ DEONTA JONES: the registered owner of the vehicle. I had the driver exit the vehicle to separate him from the odor emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. The driver complied. I asked the driver several questions regarding alcohol consumption, drug use, medications taken, and general physical health. While speaking with the driver, I continued to detect the odor of burnt marijuana emanating from his breath and person. The driver admitted to consuming/ smoking marijuana in the past. The driver admitted he was not a participant in the Maryland Medical Cannabis program. The driver submitted to the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Based on my training and experience, and the observations made of the driver, I determined the driver was not currently impaired.  I conducted a Probable Cause Search of the vehicle, based on the detected and recognized odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle. The following items were located and seized:  A. four burnt hand rolled cigarettes w/ burnt and green plant matter, suspected CDS marijuana, 0.8 grams B. two burnt hand rolled cigarettes w/ burnt plant matter, suspected CDS marijuana, 0.3 grams  Item A was located on the floor of passenger compartment, in front of the drivers seat. Item B was located in the center console/ armrest storage compartment between the drivers seat and front passenger seat. I recognized the substances to be Controlled Dangerous Substances through my training and experience with the Maryland State Police. The items were seized, captured on MSP Form 67 and 63 (P-323239), and placed in the MSP Westminster Barrack Evidence locker in accordance with MSP policy and procedure. Per the current agreement with the CCSAO, the driver was not charged with the marijuana violation.  The driver was issued traffic citation L4S0DJH for the speed violation and released from the scene. At all times the driver was polite and cooperative.  All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.  Case closed.</NarrativeText>
