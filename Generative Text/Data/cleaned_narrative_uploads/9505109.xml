         <NarrativeText>  On 08/29/2023 at approximately 0640 hours, I (TFC Hook) was dispatched to 1240 Mosser Road, McHenry, Garrett County, Maryland, for the report of a deceased person. I arrived on the scene at approximately 0648 hours, along with ambulance 952. The scene is described as a single story residence. We were met at the front door by Jeffrey Francis Tomko (12/03/1963). Jeffrey stated that when he woke up, he located his father, Francis Robert Tomko (05/20/1926) deceased in bed. Jeffrey stated his father was cold to the touch, stiff, and had no pulse.   Entering the residence, it is described as a small, two bedroom, neatly kept residence, except for the remodeling currently in progress in the kitchen. Everything appeared to be in place and nothing suspicious was observed while in the residence. The temperature was approximately 75 degrees in the residence with windows open, and a box fan running just inside the bedroom where the deceased was located. Francis was laying supine in his bed, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt, with his hands interlaced on his chest. Francis was laying on an underpad and had a blanket across his waist. Paramedic Krause (EMS # 0162431) made no life-saving attempts and declared time of death at 0648 hours. Paramedic Krause gathered all necessary information from Jeffrey and EMS personnel cleared the scene.   Jeffrey stated that his father has lived with him for approximally 11 years now, and the past three years at the current residence. Francis moved in with him after his mother passed.Francis was a diabetic and was taken off his diabetic medication towards the end of 2022, but was never able to get a doctors appointment rescheduled. Francis was prescribed Levothyroxine 100 mcg (prescription filled on 07/28 with 9 pills remaining) and Lisinopril 5 mg (prescription filled on 3/19 with 8 pills remaining). Jeffrey stated Francis was not taking his medication as prescribed as he was currently not eating or drinking regularly, and last ate a banana with a glass of water two days prior. Jeffrey stated Francis had been in bed for three days and was speaking to him up until the prior evening (08/28/2023). Before Jeffrey went to bed on 08/28/2023, he checked on Francis, and Jeffrey stated his fathers breathing appeared to be at a slower rate than normal. Continuing to ask questions, Jeffrey stated Dr. Goralski was his fathers primary care physician. Jeffrey was upset with Dr. Goralski as doctor appointments kept getting rescheduled after his father was taken off the diabetic medication. Jeffrey called into the Doctors Office the week prior and a home visit from a nurse practitioner was scheduled. Jeffrey could not remember the nurse practitioners name or what office she was sent from. Jeffrey also stated he made contact with Hospice on 08/28/2023 as he feared the time was coming, and they were to call and arrange a meeting on the 08/29/2023.   All pertinent information was relayed to the McHenry Barrack. I was contacted by Forensic Investigator Kenneth Collins. Collins gathered information and contacted the Office of the Chief Medical Examiners. Collins would call me back and state he would not be responding, and the O.C.M.E. was declining an autopsy (Case # 23-05990). Due to no foul play or signs of suspicious activity, crime scene and CED also did not respond. Newmans Funeral Home was started as the Jeffrey requested the closest available Funeral Home.   Once Newmans Funeral Home employees arrived, they assisted me in photographing the body. The shirt and pants were pulled out of the way to photograph. Slight lividity was present on the back side of Francis. Also, on his lower back was a bed sore / ulcer. Francis was wearing a pair of adult diapers underneath his sweatpants. No signs of trauma or foul play was observed on Francis. I assisted the funeral home removing Francis from the residence and cleared the scene. Photographs were uploaded to Veripic per policy.  All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.  Due to no signs of foul play or suspicious circumstances, I request this case be closed.    </NarrativeText>
