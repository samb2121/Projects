         <NarrativeText>On October 11, 2023, Sgt. Feltman (#0915) with MSP Firearms Enforcement Unit was advised of a Handgun Qualification License (HQL) revocation for Lamiko Antoine Wheeler (B/M, DOB: 01/11/1999) of Temple Hills, Maryland. Wheelers HQL was revoked due to him being convicted with Handgun in Vehicle by the Circuit Court of Prince Georges County on September 22, 2023 (C-16-CR-23-001423.)  This information was forwarded to the Maryland Gun Center where the prohibited status was confirmed and the status of one of Wheelers firearms was still outstanding. This case was forwarded to CPL J. Warrick (#6324) for further investigation.  CPL Warrick reviewed the above information and checks of law enforcement resources and social media accounts revealed no leads regarding the registered firearm or any other firearms. No information was developed to indicate Wheeler was in possession of firearms aside from the registered handgun. Wheeler has two Glock handguns registered to him in MAFSS at this time:  (2023-01-11) Glock 19 GEN 5 9mm (S/N: ADAF274) (Only firearm Wheeler is believed to be in possession of at this time)  text-align:start"&gt;(2020-04-16) Glock 23 40 cal (S/N: BKLB214)  The Glock 23 (BKLB214) was E-traced by the Crime Gun Intel Center on 6/16/23 by a Cierra Wiggins (202-648-8100). Investigators have left messages, but no response to date. Additionally, a search through law enforcement databases on the Glock 19 only show record of the previous owner selling it to a pawn shop prior to Wheeler purchasing the handgun.   On October 20, 2023, CPL J. Warrick along with S/T. S. DiToto (#5416) responded to 3444 Brinkley Road Apt 202, Temple Hills, MD, to make contact with Wheeler. There was no response at the door, S/T. DiToto left a business card in the doorway, and CPL Warrick left a detailed message on the phone number (202)322-1529, which Wheeler had used on his HQL. Without further response, investigators left area.  S/T DiToto received a phone call from Wheelers father later the same day.   On October 25, 2023, CPL Warrick made contact via telephone with Lamiko Antoine Wheeler, the suspects father. CPL Warrick requested Mr. Wheeler provided the phone number to his son and have his son reach out to investigators to discuss the case.   Later that day, CPL Warrick was contacted by Lamiko Wheeler via telephone. After a brief conversation, Wheeler advised he would surrender the Glock 19 (S/N: ADAF274) to investigators, and requested they respond to the 3444 Brinkley Road apt 202, Temple Hills address at 1200 hours on October 26, 2023.  On October 26, 2023, at approximately 1200 hours, CPL Warrick along with S/T DiToto responded to the above listed address and made contact with Lamiko A. Wheeler. Wheeler surrendered the unloaded Glock 19 to investigators. Wheeler advised the handgun had been stored in a locked safe that he did not have access to until Investigators contacted him to seize it. Through the course of the investigation there was no evidence to support that Wheeler had access to firearms or ammunition after being prohibited.   During the interaction the MSP Form #78 was completed along with Chain of custody. Lastly, an MSP form #203 (MSP Firearms Receipt and disposition Notification). Wheeler was provided with copies of these forms. Additional copies are retained for case file.   The weapon was stored in MSP Barrack U temporary storage, but will be transported to CED HQ at a later date.   This entire interaction was captured on Body worn Camera.   This case is closed unfounded due to the above facts.   </NarrativeText>
