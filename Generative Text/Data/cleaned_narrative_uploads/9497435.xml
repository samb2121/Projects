         <NarrativeText>Narrative:   On 01/25/2023, I was contacted by case worker Kristina Hoffman from the Washington County Child Advocacy Center and advised of a new case. While being seen at Wellspan Hospital in Chambersburg, PA Charlie Powell (D.O.B. 01/28/2010) reported that his father William Powell (W/M, D.O.B. 11/21/1965) touched his thing (penis). CW Hoffman noted she scheduled a forensic interview with Charlie on 02/03/2023, at 1200 hours, and requested that I attend the interview.    On 01/25/2023, I responded to the Washington County Child Advocacy Center for the interview. Prior to the interview, it was learned that two days ago Charlies mother, Sophia Smith (W/F, D.O.B. 11/10/1986) overheard Charlie telling his brother he told a lie and made up the story about his dad touching his thing.    Captioned below are notes taken during the interview by CPS Supervisor Rachel Mazloum. It is not a word for word transcript of the interview, for that please refer to the digital recording made of the interview that is stored at the Washington County Child Advocacy Center per their policies and procedures.  CPS worker Kris Hoffman interviewed Charles (age 13) using the ChildFirst Forensic Interviewing Protocol. The interview was video recorded. CPS Supervisor Rachel Mazloum and MSP Senior Trooper Darren Burleson observed the interview.  Worker started with rapport building and narrative practice. Charles was very soft spoken and did not elaborate a lot of detail initially when speaking with worker, but did answer questions asked. He talked about liking to watch golf on his Chrome Book and wanting to play golf. Worker provided an overview of the interview room and process and provided guidelines (tell the truth, dont guess).  Worker introduced the topic of body safety and touches. Worker asked about touches he likes. He noted he likes high fives. He denied there being touches he doesnt like. Worker presented the anatomically correct drawings. He labelled the penis as the thing, the female chest as the nipple, and the vagina as the I dont know.  He did not disclose anyone touching him in any sexual manner. He said he is not okay at school and he had a tough day. A girl at school, Nevaeh, asked him to be his boyfriend and he called her baby cakes and they broke up and now there is drama at school. He shared no other concerns at school. He talked about his brothers Alex and Conner and he loves both of them and plays with them. He lives with his mother, grandmother, and pop. Worker asked about his dad. He noted his dad gave him Pokmon cards and a Steelers football yesterday. He saw him at Charles house. He doesnt usually spend time with his dad because his dad has cock roaches and fleas. He noted he doesnt feel safe at his dads due to the cockroaches and fleas.  Worker asked if anyone has ever touched him in a way that made him uncomfortable what he would do - he said he would tell his dad, mom, pappy, and nanny. He talked about the Mousetrap game.  Worker exited the interview room to speak to observers and then re-entered. Worker asked Charles if he ever had to tell his mom or dad about someone touching him in a way he didnt like. He said he did tell them that his friend Nevaeh broke up with him.  He said he is grounded this weekend because he told a lie. He told a lie that his daddy touched him, but he told his brother Alex he didnt. He reiterated to worker that his dad did not touch him. Worker asked why he said his daddy touched him, and he said it is because it reminds him of his friend Nevaeh. He said now he is grounded for two weeks. Worker asked what he told his mom, and he said thats it. Worker asked if anyone told him to say that his dad didnt touch him, and he said no. Worker asked if dad has ever touched anybody else. Charles said hes nice, like his dad did yesterday when he gave him the football. Worker asked if they are ever alone together, and he said yes, and when worker asked what they do together, he said Im with mom and then said he and dad are never by themselves together.  He talked about going to Brook Lane because he choked Conner. He said he was jealous of Conner because Conner didnt get in time out and Charles did. His mom caught him choking Conner. He said Conner was hurt, but now hes fine. Worker asked what made him stop choking Conner, and he said because I got the help. Worker asked if anyone has ever choked Charles, and he said no. The interview was ended after reverting to a neutral topic.  Due to the above stated facts, I request this case be closed, unfounded.  All the above events occurred in Washington County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
