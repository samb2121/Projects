         <NarrativeText>***In Car Camera/ Body worn camera operational***   Scene Processing: Due to the nature of the incident, no scene processing conducted. Narrative:  Weather:Dry  Defendant: Wineke, Tammy Reinay Date of Birth: 08/17/1971 Date of Arrest: 07/04/2023 Time of Arrest: 2201 hours License#: MD, W-520-785-734-643 DUI #: 23-104 North East  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)   On July 4th, 2023 at approximately 2147 hours, I Trooper First Class Eby of the Maryland State Police, was on duty in full uniform, operating marked patrol vehicle F-35. I was dispatched and responded to Route 276 and Cowan Road, Port Deposit, Maryland, 21904, for a two-vehicle collision. See accident report for further detail.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)   Upon contact with the operator of the silver Chevrolet cobalt, I positively identified Tammy Reinay Wineke (DOB: 08/17/1971), by her Maryland drivers license. In speaking with Wineke, I observed her to struggle with keeping her balance/ swaying, using her vehicle to assist her with her balance while walking, and she was slurring her words when speaking with me. I asked Wineke which road she was traveling on prior to the accident, at which point she struggled to remember which way she was traveling on which roadway. I asked Wineke if she had consumed any alcoholic beverages, in which she stated she did not. I asked Wineke if she was taking any medications, in which she responded Oxycodone, Baclofen, Gabapentin. Wineke stated she had taken all three listed medications at approximately 2000 hours, approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes prior to the accident. I asked Wineke if she would perform standardized field sobriety test, in which she stated she would. She advised me she would struggle with the balance aspect of the testing due to pre existing injuries.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   The evaluation was performed on the shoulder of Route 276, free from obvious debris, and level. The roadway did not have any obstructions in the pavement from the accident. My emergency equipment remained activated to make motorist aware of the accident, and to provide scene safety while conducting SFSTs.  Medications: Oxycodone, Baclofen, Gabapentin Glasses/Contacts: N/A Medical Impairments: Injuries in her neck with 3 disc, affecting her balance.    The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. My pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Winekes eyes. Wineke was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes until told to stop. Winekes pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. During this test I asked Wineke if she had consumed any alcoholic beverages. Wineke paused and stated she had a couple of 10 oz beers.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes  WALK AND TURN (1/8 clues observed)  Prior to Wineke performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Wineke was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. Wineke was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Wineke was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Wineke was to keep her hands flat at her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Wineke was explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around. Wineke was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Wineke was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her side, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. Wineke stated she understood the test. Wineke was unable finish or perform the walk and turn.  Instructional Stage:  1.) Wineke lost balance.  Walking Stage (1st Nine):  N/A  Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  N/A  Turn:  N/A  ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed)  Wineke stated she was unable to perform this test.   ARREST:  I had reason to believe Wineke was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, she was placed under arrest and seated in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. While seating her in the front seat of my patrol vehicle, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her person.   The DR-15 advice of rights was read for Wineke, at the North East Barrack. Wineke signed the DR-15 at approximately 2238 hours, willing to submit to a chemical intoximeter breath test. Wineke submitted a breath alcohol concentration of .12 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Wineke was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to her husband at the North East Barrack.   I request this case be closed by arrest.   All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.    Case closed.   </NarrativeText>
