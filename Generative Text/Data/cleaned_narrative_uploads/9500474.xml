         <NarrativeText>MSP unmarked vehicle MD registration 9EM6883 is equipped with inoperable in-car camera, help-desk ticket # 235158. This stop was recorded on L-41 Body Worn Camera #7347.   Defendant:Gary Douglass Snowden Sr. Date of Birth: 10/14/1959  Date of Arrest:05/14/2023  Time of Arrest:1517hours  DUI #:23-149  MD Drivers License #:S53527149790  Forestville Barrack  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING *Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *Completed the Advanced Roadside Impairment Driving Enforcement Program. *Trained and certified to operate the Preliminary Breath Test through the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Sunday, May 14th, 2023, at approximately 1408 hours, I, Trooper Clark # 7347 of the Maryland State Police  Forestville Barrack was dispatched to a two-vehicle collision on Northbound 301 prior to Dyson Rd, Prince Georges County MD. I arrived at the scene and observed a black Ford F250 displaying Maryland registration 3CD8399 with functional left side damage and a black Honda Accord displaying Maryland registration 8CH9261 with heavy right-front side damage.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the operator of vehicle 2 (black Honda Accord) who was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Gary Douglass Snowden Sr. DOB:10/14/1959, African American male.The driver of vehicle 1 (black Ford F-250)was later identified as Brian Keith Petty DOB: 10/25/1966 African American male. While speaking with Snowden Sr., I smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I askedSnowden Sr. how much alcoholic beverage he had consumed before driving. He replied stating, 1 Miller beer about an hour ago.I observed Snowden Sr.had bloodshed eyes and slurred speech. I advisedSnowden Sr. that I was going to put him through the Standardized Field Sobriety Test to make sure he was safe to drive. He replied stating yes, do what youve got to do.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluationwas performed on a flat surface on the shoulder of the beltway. The surface was dry, level and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 65 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of daylight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during the test.Before administering the Standardized Field Test, I asked Snowden Sr.if he had anyinjuries that couldprevent him from completing the test correctly. He stated no. I asked the following questions: * Do you have glasses on: Yes * Do you have any Medical conditions that couldprevent you from taking this test: No * Do you currently have any Injuries: No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS(6/6 Clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches from Snowden Sr. eyes. Snowden Sr. was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus as instructed with his eyes during the testing. Both eyes tracked equally, and both pupils were equally sized.Snowden Sr. exhibited the following clues: *Lack of smooth pursuit -present in both eyes. * Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at MaximumDeviation - present in both eyes. *Onset Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees -Present. *Vertical Nystagmus was also present.  WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed) Prior to Snowden Sr.performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Snowden Sr.was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe.Alekseyevwas instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin.Snowden Sr. was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step.Snowden Sr. was instructed to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step,Snowden Sr. was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the ground, and to take a series of small steps around with his lead foot to turn completely around.Snowden Sr. was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series.Snowden Sr. was instructed that once he began the test, he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Snowden Sr.if he understood the test, and he stated, yes.  INSTRUCTIONAL STAGE: 1.Snowden Sr. did not keep balance (Lost his balance and broke his feet apart several times) 2. He began walking too soon during the instruction stage  WALKING STAGE(FirstNine) 3. He missed heel to toe on steps 1 and 2 4. He stepped off-line while walking 5. He swayed during the test.  WALKING STAGE(SecondNine):  Snowden Sr. refused to complete the test  ONE LEG STAND (0 clues observed) Refusal  ARREST Based on the following, I had reason to believeSnowden Sr. was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol: *Strong odor of alcoholic beverage coming from his breath * Observed signs of impairment while he performed the test. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot with a glazed look. * His admission of alcohol consumption prior to driving * Slurred speech.  I arrested Snowden Sr. for driving under the influence of alcoholat approximately 1517 hours, and he was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Maryland State Police  Forestville Barrack for processing.  20 MINUTES OBSERVATION PERIOD Once at the barrack, a secondary search and mouth check was conducted on Snowden Sr. at 1548 hours. Snowden Sr.was under my custody until his release time.I playedthe English audio DR-15 Advice of Rights form toSnowden Sr. in English in its entirety. At the conclusion of the form,Snowden Sr. verbally advised that he refused to submit to the intoximeter test and refused to sign the form indicating the same.Snowden Sr. was charged with driving under the influence of alcoholand was givena copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, DR-15A Officers Certification Order of Suspension, and all appropriate citations.
