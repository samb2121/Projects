         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on my Maryland State Police issued BWC. T-13 front camera was operational.   Defendant: Marilyn Stephani Campos- Lopez  Date of Birth: 01/21/1997  Date of Arrest: July 1, 2023  Time of Arrest: 0130  DUI: 23-075  Vehicle in Motion: (Phase 1):   On Saturday, July 1st, 2023 at approximately 0058 hours, I was on duty, in my uniform, operating my marked Maryland State Police Ford Explorer, T-13. While on routine patrol, I observed a black Acura bearing Virginia registration TYL2860, driving northbound in lane 1 on MD RT 235 in the area of Clarkes Landing Rd, in Hollywood Maryland. While observing the Acura, I observed the Acura switched into lane 2 without signaling before doing so. The Acura continued northbound in lane 2 and was consistently driving over the solid white line. I activated my emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop. While my emergency equipment was activated, the Acura continued northbound on MD RT 235 before eventually stopping.  Personal Contact (Phase 2):   I performed a driver side approach and made contact with the driver I identified myself as a Maryland State Trooper and advised the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver for her drivers license and registration. The driver began to fumble in the glove compartment box attempting to look for the registration card. The driver was eventually identified as, Marilyn Stephani Campos-Lopez (H/F DOB: 01/27/1997), through her Virginia provisional drivers license. Upon making contact with Lopez, I smelled the strong and distinct odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and the vehicle. Lopez eyes were glassy, bloodshot and her speech was slurred and lethargic. I asked Lopez has she been drinking today and Lopez stated 1. I asked Lopez, one what and Lopez advised one (1) Truly.   I requested Lopez to step out of her vehicle and walk to the front of her vehicle. As I continued to talk to Lopez, I continued to smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and person. I continued to observe Lopez eyes to be glossy and red. Lopez speech was still lethargic. I informed Lopez that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which she agreed.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3):   The evaluation was performed on MD RT 235. I placed Lopez in front of her vehicle which was the clearest and most level spot for Standardized Field Sobriety test. I turned my emergency equiupent off to not interfere with the evaluation. The area for Standardized Field Sobriety Test was dry and free of debris. Standardized Field Sobriety Test was conducted during nighttime hours. Lopez advised she had no injuries to her brain, wore no contacts, and had glasses she needs. Lopez advised no injuries to her lower extremities and could conduct the SFST.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) 6/6 clues:   The first test for the SFST was the HGN test. Lopez was placed in a manner with her feet together, and her arms down to his sides. She was told to remain in that position for the duration of the test. The tip of my pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches from Lopez eyes. Lopez was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes and her eyes only until told to stop. Lopez advised she understood the directions given. The following observations were observed on Lopez:   Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes  Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at Maximum deviation: Present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees: Present in both eyes.  Walk and Turn 4/8 clues:   Prior to Lopez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Lopez was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of his left foot, touching heel-to-toe. Lopez was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her sides, and to remain in the position until told to begin. Lopez was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel-to-toe on every step. Lopez was to keep her hands flat by her side, keeping her eyes focused on her feet, and count every step out loud. On the ninth step, Lopez was instructed and demonstrated to keep her lead foot planted, and to take a series of small steps in a 180 degree semicircle, around with her rear foot to face the direction she came from. Lopez was instructed and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps as to be performed identical to the first series. Lopez was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her sides, maintaining heel-to-toe contact, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. Lopez advised he understood the directions.  Instruction Phase:   During the Instructional Phase, Lopez broke the starting position multiple times, separating her feet from the heel to toe position she was advised to remain in.  Walking Phase (1st Nine Steps):  Lopez missed heel to toe contact by more than  inch on steps 1 through 9. Lopez stepped off-line by more than  inch on steps 1 through 9. Lopez performed an improper turn by turning the wrong direction than instructed and lifting both feet off the ground.  Walking Phase (2nd Nine Steps):  Lopez missed heel to toe contact by more than  inch on steps 1 through 7. Lopez stepped off-line by more than  inch on steps 1 through 9.  One Leg Stand 3/4 clues:   Prior to Lopez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Lopez was instructed to stand with her feet together with her hands down by her sides while the instructions were given and the test was performed. Lopez was explained when the test begins, she was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised she was instructed to keep her leg straight, look down at the raised foot, and count out loud, and continue the test until he was told to stop. Lopez advised he understood the directions.  Seconds 0-10:  Lopez swayed.   Seconds 11-20:  Lopez put her foot down advising she was nervous.  Seconds 21-30:  Lopez did not attempt this portion of the test again.   While on scene, at approximately 0121 hours, Lopez was offered a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) which resulted in a .15 BrAC.  ARREST:   Based on the following, I had reason to believe Lopez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:   Odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath and person.  Lopez admitting to consuming an alcoholic beverage.  Lopez eyes were glossy, red and speech was slurred.  Lopez exhibited numerous clues during Standardized Field Sobriety Testing.   I concluded Lopez was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 0129 hours, I placed Lopez under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. A search of Lopez was conducted on scene and revealed that she did not have anything in her mouth. Lopez was placed in the front passenger seat per policy. Lopez was transported to the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack. When I arrived at the barrack, Lopez was read and audibly played her DR-15 Advice of Rights. While continuing to talk to Lopez, I continued to smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Lopez breath and person. I observed Lopez eyes to be glossy and red. Speech still slurred. At approximately 0135 hours, I finished reading the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Lopez stated she understood what was read to her and refused to submit to the intoximeter test.  Lopez signed and was provided copies of all pertinent paperwork, citations, and was released to the care and custody of her sister.   I request this case to be closed, by arrest.  All events occurred in St. Marys County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
