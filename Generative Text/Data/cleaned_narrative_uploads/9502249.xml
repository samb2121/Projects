         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on my BWC and MVR.  Scene Processing:    Due to the nature of the incident, there is no scene processing.  Narrative:   On 10/16/2023 at approximately 0510 hours, I, TFC Louderback of the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack, was sitting stationary in the right shoulder on northbound 295 (Baltimore-Washington Pkwy) at Arundel Mills Blvd, in a marked Ford Explorer, shooting LIDAR with a Pro Laser 3 serial # LF 14444. I am certified by Maryland State Police to operate the LIDAR unit. The Pro Laser 3 was tested before and after my shift, and was working properly. On that date and time, I observed a black SUV, in lane 3, traveling at a very high rate of speed passing several vehicles in lanes 1 and 2. I estimated the speed of that vehicle to be traveling 110 mph in a 55 mph zone. I pointed the Pro Laser 3 at that vehicle and obtained a speed of 114 mph in a 55 mph zone at 715.6 feet. The black SUV passed me and continued at a high rate of speed. I took off from my position to conduct a traffic stop on that vehicle, but at that time I did not activate my emergency equipment. While I was trying to catch up, the black SUV was unsafely and abruptly changing lanes to pass other vehicles. It was following within 5 feet of the vehicle in front of it and when it changed lanes, it would cut off the other vehicle, causing them to have to apply their brakes. When it could not pass the vehicles in the travel portion of the lane, it would move to the right shoulder to pass. I also observed the black SUV flashing its high beams at the other vehicles to move out of its way. The way this black SUV was being driven was putting lives at risk. I was able to catch up to the black SUV, just south of Ridge Road. It was in lane 1 behind a vehicle within 5 feet of it, and flashing its high beams rapidly at it. The vehicle that was in front of the black SUV moved from lane 1 to lane 2. I placed myself behind the black SUV. I got itsmake and model, Mercedes-Benz GLB, and a Maryland tag, 8FH4076.The blackMercedes-Benz immediately moved from lane 1 to the right shoulder to pass more vehicles.I activated my emergency equipment to conduct the traffic stop. The blackMercedes-Benz did not stop but increased its speed from 70 mph to over 91 mph. It passed 6 vehicles while it was on the right shoulder, going over 91 mph. These speed were captured on my MVR camera. It then moved from the right shoulder to lane 1 and continued to increase its speed. After it passed one vehicle, that was in lane 2, it moved from lane 1 to the deceleration lane to westbound I-195. I slowed down, deactivated my emergency equipment because pursuing that vehicle would not meet our pursuit policy. I moved to the deceleration lane and took the ramp to westbound I-195 just in case theMercedes-Benz crashed while taking the ramp at the high rate of speed. I slowed down to 30 mph, got onto westbound I-195, and exited off to southbound 295.     Theblack Mercedes-Benz GLBs Maryland tag was run through NCIC and the registered owner was Omolola Titilope Bashua (B/F, DOB: 03/03/2000). Her name was run through a TLO system and I obtained her phone number. I called the phone number and left a message on her voicemail to call the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie barrack. Bashua called the barrack and I spoke to her. She stated she was not driving. Her brother Temitope Oluwaseun Bashua (B/M, DOB: 03/09/1996) was using her vehicle. She gave me his information and a phone number to contact him. I ran his name through NCIC and found he had a suspended Maryland drivers license.    I contactedTemitope Oluwaseun Bashua at approximately 0630 hours and spoke to him. He stated he just woke up, and he was not driving at 0510 that morning. I asked if the blackMercedes-Benz GLB was located at his house.Temitope Bashua stated I will look at my camera. He then stated yes, it is in my driveway. I got his current residence location 101 Conewago Ct, Owings Mills, MD 21117. I askedTemitope Bashua why he ran from me, and he continued to state he was not driving. I advised him that his Maryland drivers license is suspended, and he was not allowed to drive. This gives him motivation not to stop for a traffic stop. On 04/02/2023, he got a warning in Baltimore County for speeding and driving off roadway while passing. On 11/21/2022, he got a warning in Baltimore County for speeding.    I did a Google Map direction from northbound 295 at Arundel Mills Blvd toTemitope Bashua current residence. The Google Maps stated it would take 30 minutes to get to his residence. He had enough time to make it home before I contacted him.    Based on the Maryland registration information I got from theMercedes-Benz that did not stop, Omolola Bashua statements of her brother having herMercedes-Benz, andTemitope Bashua stating theMercedes-Benz was sitting in his driveway at the time I spoke to him. I have enough reasonable articulated suspicion evidence to chargeTemitope Bashua with traffic citations.    All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
