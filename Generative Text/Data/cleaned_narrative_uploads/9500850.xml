         <NarrativeText>MSP marked patrol vehicle N-5 in-car camera/body camera operational  Defendant: Sang Hun Lee  Date of Birth: 07/28/1962  Maryland Drivers License: L-000-758-319-592  Date of Arrest: 05/21/2023  Time of Arrest: 1745 hours  DUI #: 23-119 (Rockville Barrack)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATIONS:    I am trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am trained and certified to conduct preliminary breathalyzer tests by the Maryland State Police.  I am trained and certified in Advanced Roadside Impaired Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.) through the Maryland State Police   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1):   On May 21st, 2023 at approximately 1722 hours, I, Trooper Yarbrough (#7291) of the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack was dispatched to a vehicle that could not maintain its lane and almost struck multiple vehicles eastbound 495 in the area of Connecticut avenue. I caught up to the vehicle eastbound 495 in the area of MD 95. I observed a silver Toyota Tundra displaying Maryland registration 2CR6288 almost strike another vehicle and failing to maintain its lane. At that time I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):    I made contact with the driver, who was sitting in the drivers seat with the vehicle running. I smelleda strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his person. I identified the driver as Sang Hun Lee (A/M DOB: 07/28/1962) by his Maryland Drivers License L-000-758-319-592. While talking to the driver, I observed Mr. Lees eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Mr. Lee waslethargic and was slow to perform any moving action.When asked about the consumption of alcohol, Mr. Lee stated he had a few drinks. I asked Mr. Lee where he was coming from and where he was going. He stated he was heading from a friends house and going to the casino to gamble. I then asked Mr. Lee toperform some Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Mr. Lee agreed to take the tests.    While talking to Mr. Lee, in an ambient environment, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):   I requested Mr. Lee to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. The tests were performed in front of the Toyota Tundra.The surface was dry, level, and clear from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of the sun. The patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all tests. Mr. Lee was positioned in a manner to ensure thatpassing traffic would not interfere with the test results. Mr. Lee appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any physical injuries. I asked his the following questions:  Physical Injuries: None.  Medical Conditions: Diabetes  Medications: None.  Glasses and/or Contacts: Glasses  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed):   The first test performed was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. The tip of a pen was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Mrs. Garcias eyes. he was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head stationary while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with only his eyes until told to stop. Mr. Lee acknowledged he understood the test. his pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. Mr. Lee moved his head multiple times from the stationary position to follow the stimulus.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation.  Onset of nystagmus prior to 45-degrees.   WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed):  Prior to Mr. Lee performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted.Mr. Lee was instructed to place his left foot on an imaginary straight line and place his right foot on the same line in front of his left foot with hisheel touching histoe.Mr. Lee was to place hishands flat at hissides and to remain in that position until told to begin.Mr. Lee was instructed to take nine (9) steps on the straight line touching heel to toe on every step.Mr. Lee was told to keep hishands flat at hisside, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step,Mr. Lee was demonstrated and explained to keep hislead foot on the straight line, and to take a series of small steps around hislead foot with hisrear foot to turn completely around.Mr. Lee was then explained and demonstrated that the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series of nine (9) steps.Mr. Lee was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed.Mr. Lee was instructed to keep hishands down by hisside, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I askedMr. Lee if he completely understood the instructions, and he stated, Yes. The results were as follows:    Mr. Lee missed heel to toe on 4 of thefirst set of instructed nine stepsand all the second set of instructed nine steps.  Mr. Lee performed an improper turn.  Mr. Lee could not maintain balance during the instruction stage.  Mr. Lee took 8steps on the first and 9steps on thesecond set of instructed nine steps.  Mr. Lee stopped the test before and after making the turn.  Mr. Lee stepped off-line on first and second set of instructed nine steps.  Mr. Lee used his arms for balance.   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed):   Prior to Mr. Lee performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Mr. Lee was instructed to stand with hisheels together and hands down by hissides while the instructions were given. Mr. Lee was instructed to not begin the test until he was instructed to do so, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to keep hishands down by hisside and raise the foot of hischoice off the ground approximately six inches. While hisfoot was raised, he was to keep hisleg straight, watch hisraised foot, and count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Mr. Lee was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated Yes. Mr. Lee raised hisrightfoot. The results were as follows:    Mr. Lee put his foot down on multipleoccasions.  Mr. Lee swayed back and forth.  Mr. Lee stopped the test.     I offered Mr. Lee a preliminary breath test and results were .17 BAC.  ARREST:   At 1745 hours Mr. Lee was placed under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. A search incident to arrest revealed that Mr. Lee had no contraband on hisperson and nothing was in hismouth. Mr. Lee was then transported to the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack for further processing.Mr. Lee was advised of hisDR-15 Advice of Rights in English utilizing the MVA website recording. Additionally, Mr. Lee was provided a copy and shown both the Spanish and English side to read over. At 1845 hours (05/21/2023), Mr. Lee accepted to submit to the chemical breath test. Mr. Lee provided an insufficient breath which resulted in a refusal.   RELEASE:   Mr. Lee was issued all appropriate citations and paperwork. Mr. Lee was released to a sober driver.   I request the case be closed by arrest. All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland </NarrativeText>
