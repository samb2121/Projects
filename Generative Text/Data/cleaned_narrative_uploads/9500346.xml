         <NarrativeText>DUI Case # 23-MSP-031075  TRAINING: STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TEST TRAINED ADVANCED ROADSIDE IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT  DEFENDANT: Rafael Cordozo Figueroa DOB: 05/11/1996 874 Broadfield Drive, Newark, DE 19713  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion On September 3, 2023, at 21:44 hours, I, Trooper Williams #7381 of the Maryland State Police, was on patrol when I received a call for service for a motor vehicle collision. The collision was located at 3043 Singerly Road, Elkton, Cecil County, Maryland. Upon my arrival, I observed a tan 2009 Honda Accord bearing Delaware registration 515528 off of the roadway with sever frontend damage. I made contact with a male in a blue short-sleeved shirt with blue jeans who identified himself as Rafael Cordozo-Figueroa, DOB: 05/11/1996, Delaware Soundex: 2140819, Hispanic/male who was the operator of the tan 2009 Honda Accord bearing Delaware registration 515528. Trooper First Class Jaskiewicz #6576, Trooper First Class Hughes #7110, Trooper First Class Billstone #7270, and Fireboard/EMS were on scene prior to my arrival.   Phase # 2 - Personal Contact While speaking with Mr. Figueroa I immediately observed red and glassy eyes I detected the light odor of alcohol coming from the drivers person. I observed multiple beer bottles within the cab one of the open bottles was on the dash of the vehicle as well as on the ground near the vehicle. Mr. Figueroa had multiple passengers within the vehicle at the time of the collision. While attempting to speak with Mr. Figueroa, he advised did not speak English we awaited the arrival of his brother Gustavo Cardoso-Figueroa, DOB: 02/12/1990. Once Mr. Gustavo arrived on scene he began interpreting for his brother. While speaking with Mr. Figueroa he advised he did not observe the oncoming vehicle traveling on Singerly Road. Mr. Figueroa advised he then attempted to merge onto Singerly Rd which led to the vehicles colliding. I asked Mr. Figueroa if he would be willing to complete a witness statement form Mr. Figueroa stated Yes. I returned to my vehicle to acquire the Witness Statement forms. During my second approach Mr. Gustavo advised that he could not write on the written statement form due to him being unable read and write in English. Mr. Gustavo advised his wife could come to the scene of the collision to complete the forms. Mrs. Figueroa arrived on scene and completed the form on her brother in-laws behalf. I asked Mr. Figueroa if he would be willing to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Mr. Benitez Argueta stated Yes. Phase # 3 - Pre-Arrest Screening  I began conversing with Mr. Benitez Argueta about his Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and asked him the following questions: Do you have any injuries I need to be made aware of? No. Glasses/Contacts: No. Do you take any medication? No. I am trained by the Maryland State Police in performing Standard Field Sobriety Tests. The test was performed on the shoulder of the roadway the ground was free of debris and the surface was level.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus - 6 of 6 clues The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test. The pen tip was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Mr. Figueroa eyes and slightly above his eye level. Mr. Figueroa was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while focusing on and following the stimulus with his eyes, and his eyes only, and keep his hands down at his side until told to stop. Mr. Figueroa pupils were equal in size and displayed equal tracking. Mr. Figueroa was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. 1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Before 45 Degrees - Present.  *Additional Observation* Mr. Figueroa had to be reminded two times not to rotate his head. Mr. Figueroa also had to be reminded to look at the stimulus two times during the test.  Walk and Turn - 4 of 8 clues Before Mr. Figueroa performed the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Mr. Figueroa was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot, touch heel to toe, and place his hands down at his side. He was instructed to stand in this manner until told to begin. Mr. Figueroa was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching hell to toe on each step. Mr. Figueroa was advised to keep his hands down at his side, keep his eyes focused on his lead foot on the ground, and take a series of small steps around his foot that was pivoted while turning. Mr. Figueroa was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Mr. Figueroa was told once he began the test not to stop and to walk until the test was completed, to keep his hands down by his side, look down at his feet, and count each step aloud. After stating that he understood the instructions and had no questions about the test then the test was administered.  *INSTRUCTIONAL PHASE* Walking Stage (1st nine): Stops walking, Raises arms, Missed heel to toe, Walking Stage (2nd nine): Missed heel to toe all steps Turn: Completed satisfactorily. Starts too soon.  One Leg Stand  Refused Before Mr. Figueroa performed the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Mr. Figueroa was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his legs straight, look at his raised foot, count out loud by thousands (one thousand one, one thousand two), and continue the test until told to stop. After he indicated understanding the instructions, the test was administered.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TESTS PBT not offered.  ARREST: Because of the above observations, Mr. Figueroa was unable to operate a vehicle safely, and he was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0030 hours. Mr. Figueroa was taken to Union Hospital and read the DR 15 Advice of Rights Form. Mr. Figueroa advised he was willing to take a blood test, sample kit F-208 was used and submitted.  At this time, I request the case be closed. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
