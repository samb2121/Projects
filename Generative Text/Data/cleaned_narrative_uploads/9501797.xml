         <NarrativeText>Crime Scene Processing:    Domestic Violence from completed.  Neighborhood Checks:    Due to the nature of the crime, neighborhood checks were not completed.  Narrative:    On 12/1/23 at 0945 hours, I was dispatched to the area of MD RT 36 at MD RT 40, Cumberland, MD 21502 for a reported domestic dispute. Upon arrival, I made contact with, Maurice Antonio Eaton Jr, who advised he was in a domestic dispute with his girlfriend, Melissa Tonisha Jackson.  Eaton advised he was in a verbal alteration with Jackson in the early morning hours and decided to leave the residence. Eaton advised he left the residence to go to the Cumberland Mission Center and Jackson did not want him to leave. Eaton stated he began walking from his residence and Jackson followed him in her vehicle. Eaton said Jackson began following him and got out of her vehicle and began yelling at him. Eaton initially advised he was struck by Jackson but did not cooperate when asked how he was struck. Eaton continued to advise he did not want to press charges and did not have any marks on his person. Eaton continued to grab his right shoulder and when asked how he hurt his shoulder he would not cooperate in answering any questions. I requested EMS to scene to check Eaton. EMS arrived at scene and Eaton stated Im good and he refused paramedics to treat him. Eaton appeared to be intoxicated as I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person. Eaton stated he wanted to leave and did not need police. Eaton completed a Domestic Violence Form and screened in as a High Risk Danger. Eaton was asked and advised to speak with a counselor, and he refused. During the initial questioning with Eaton he advised he was struck by Jacksons car but during the questioning he would not cooperate on what occurred.    I made contact with Jackson who advised she was in a verbal altercation with Eaton. Jackson said Eaton was intoxicated and gets High all the time on drugs. Jackson said Eaton wanted to leave the residence, and she was attempting to help him by not leaving due to her believing he was leaving to do drugs. Jackson said she followed Eaton in her vehicle and attempted to get him back in her vehicle. Jackson stated there was no physical assault and when asked about striking him with her vehicle she advised Eaton slapped her vehicle.    I made contact with the witness, Gina Richelle Fox, who advised she was driving near the animal shelter on Old Mount Savage Rd., when she observed Jackson and Eaton. Fox stated she observed Jackson driving the vehicle and Eaton get out of the vehicle. Fox advised she observed Jackson shoving Eaton and they both were throwing there arms around. Fox stated Eaton was walking away from Jackson, and she would get back in her vehicle and follow him down the road. Fox advised Jackson continued to yell at Eaton, and she called police. Fox advised she did not see Jackson attempt to strike Eaton with her vehicle.    I did not observe any physical marks on either party.    Both parties were advised onto how to obtain a protective order.    Both parties were advised a report would be written to document the incident, advised of the case status and provided a case number.    I request this case be closed due to victim failing to cooperate.  All events occurred in Allegany County, MD.</NarrativeText>
