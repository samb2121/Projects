         <NarrativeText>L-22 BWC OPERATIONAL  CASE NUMBER: 23-MSP-026236  DATE OF INCIDENT: 7/23/2023 0845 hours  LOCATION: Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack 3500 Forestville Road Forestville, MD 20747  ATTACHMENTS: 1. Written statement of alleged carjacking 2. Written confession  VICTIM / COMPLAINANT: STATE OF MARYLAND  SUSPECT: Edwin Jonathan Jones DOB:04/04/1968   NARRATIVE:  On 7/25/2023 at approximately 0845 hours I, Trooper Murray #7580, was on routine patrol in my marked MSP vehicle MV-30 when I was called to respond to the Maryland State Police Forestville barrack to take a report of an alleged carjacking. Upon my arrival, I was informed by Sgt. Landis #5082 that the complainant was standing in the lobby. I identified the complainant as being Edwin Jonathan Jones (DOB: 04/04/1968,B/M). Sgt. Landis informed me that he had already spoken to Mr. Jones and that he had written and signed a statement about the alleged carjacking. TFC White #6931 and myself went into the lobby of the barrack where I introduced myself to him. We proceeded to the interview room where we could speak more privately. Before continuing the interview, I informed Mr. Jones that all the statements he would give would be considered factual and true statements, and that I was equipped with a body-worn camera that would be recording.  Jones proceeded to tell myself and TFC White how the alleged carjacking took place. Jones alleged that he had been driving on S/B RT. 301 at Maude Brown Savoy Road when he alleged that two men with weapons forced him out of his vehicle. Mr. Jones further alleged the vehicle that had been stolen from him was involved in motor vehicle collision shortly after, and that he had not been driving the vehicle at the time. Jones described the two men as wearing masks and armed with guns. While Jones was stopped at a steady red traffic signal, he said that the two men approached his vehicle, a red Ford F-150 bearing Maryland registration 3BK4848. Myself and TFC White asked him whether he could provide a physical description of the men who allegedly carjacked him. He stated they were both black males, and that they wore masks and carried pistols. Jones was unable to provide any details about where the men came from or if they got out of a vehicle. After being forced out of the vehicle, Jones stated that he began running away from the vehicle. Initially, Jones suggested that he ran Southbound on RT. 301. However, after I asked whether to know whether any vehicles had passed him, he stated that he was heading Northbound. After he had finished his description of the events, myself and TFC White gave him the opportunity to change his story, informing him that if he provided a false statement he would be charged for it. Jones then informed us that the alleged carjacking had never taken place. Before asking any further questions, Jones was read his Miranda rights. Jones waived his rights and agreed to answer questions. Jones advised he had been involved in a motor vehicle collision the night before and fled the scene after, claiming that he had not known what to do. Jones stated that he had been coming from a family reunion, and had left before his wife. TFC White asked Jones what he had done after being involved in the collision. After leaving the scene of the collision, Jones wife picked him up. The vehicle that Jones had been driving was a work truck, owned by Ariosa  Company. Jones then informed his company the next morning that the truck had been stolen. TFC White asked why he had decided to report the vehicle as stolen rather than report what had actually happened to his company. Jones stated that he had been afraid that he would be fired from his job, and so decided to report the vehicle as stolen. Jones signed a statement confirming the true version of the events and signed it.  I request that this case remain open pending service of charges against Jones.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
