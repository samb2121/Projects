         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  On 2/5/2023 at approximately 0246 hrs, I responded to 32319 National Pike NE Little Orleans, MD, in reference to an unattended death investigation. Upon my arrival, I contacted Paramedic Lori Moyer. Moyer stated that when she arrived at the residence, she found the deceased woman laying on the bedroom floor on the first floor of the residence. Moyer determined that rigor mortis had begun to set in and that any life-saving efforts would be futile. Moyer officially pronounced the woman deceased at 0253 hrs. The deceased woman was later identified by MD ID card, as Wanda Jean Whitfield, W-F 12/13/63.    I then contacted Danny Whitfield, the husband of the deceased woman. Danny Whitfield stated that Wanda had been sick in bed the previous day (2/4/2023). At approximately 2200 hrs, Danny went to bed in the same bed as Wanda. He stated that he heard Wanda breathing and that she was asleep. At approximately 0230 hrs, Danny awakened to use the bathroom. When he returned from the bathroom, He noticed Wanda was not breathing. Danny telephoned 911 and received instructions on how to perform CPR. Danny moved Wanda to the floor and began CPR.    Danny advised me that Wandas primary physician was Nurse Practitioner, Robyn Fowler. Fowlers office is located in Woodsboro, Frederick Co MD. Danny stated that Wanda had been seen by Fowler within the past 2 months. He also stated that Wanda had recently been to the emergency room at UPMC Western MD in Cumberland, for trouble breathing. Danny stated that Wanda suffered from COPD, Congestive heart failure and had spinal injuries from numerous falls in the past several years. Danny stated that it was common for him to return home from work to find Wanda on the floor of the residence due to a fall.    I then contacted Forensic Investigator, Pamela Burkett via telephone. I apprised Burkett of the circumstances surrounding the unattended death. Burkett contacted the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and relayed the information to them. Burkett advised that an autopsy wouldnt be completed and to release the body to a funeral home of the husbands choosing.    I took photographs of the body in the position it was in when I arrived. I also photographed a list of medications that Wanda Whitfield was prescribed and taking. I also completed MSP Form 89B, Death Investigation supplement.     I asked Mr. Whitfield which funeral home he preferred and he stated Grove Funeral home in Hancock, MD. Grove was contacted and a livery service was dispatched to remove the body. I remained at the residence until the body was removed.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  On February 17, 2023, I, (Sgt. Divelbiss #4425) MSP-Cumberland Barrack criminal supervisor was forwarded an emailed from the Allegany County Crime Solvers (email attached). The email was titled as Tip Information and the complainant elected to be anonymous. The anonymous citizens tip was in reference to MSP case 23MSP004502, death investigation of Wanda Jean Whitfield. The citizen stated they believed the victims husband, Dan Whitfield let his wife (victim) lay in bed suffering for a week and would not take her to the hospital. The citizen additionally stated Dan Whitfield took the victims phone, so she could not answer calls or make calls for help as well as did not provide her with food or heart medication. Last the citizen described Dan Whitfield as being an alcoholic who made the victims life a living hell and when he was tired of her he let her die.    Upon receiving this information, I immediately followed up on the initial case, as the case status was listed as closed. I made contact with the victims primary care physician, CRNP Roybn Fowler ( 301-845-6322) at Frederick Primary Care in Woodsboro, MD. NP. Fowler was very familiar with the victim and her health prior to her death. The victim had within the last year suffered a heart attack and currently had cancer for which she elected not to seek treatment. NP. Fowler recalled the victim at her last visit, just over a month before her death. NP. Fowler noticed the victims weight loss and her decline in heath. I asked NP. Fowler if she believed the victims death was related to neglect of care was the crime solvers tip stated. NP. Fowler stated she does not suspect that to be the case, however, there is no way to prove this theory as the victims body as been cremated. I asked NP. Fowler if she was familiar with Dan Whitfield, and she stated was not. She explained the victim came to her visits along. She recalled the victim referring to her husband during her visits, but the victim never said she was in fear of Dan Whitfield. NP. Fowler provided no further information.  Based on the above investigation, I request this case to be CLOSED, as there is no evidence to suspect foul play in the victims death.  Case: Closed</NarrativeText>
