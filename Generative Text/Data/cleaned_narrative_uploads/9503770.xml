         <NarrativeText>*Assigned to Maryland State Police Cumberland Barrack* MSP marked vehicle C-13 is equipped with a mobile recording device and Body worn camera.   Defendant: Lisa Marie Payton  Date of Birth: 9/17/1981  Date of Arrest: 2/19/23  Times of Arrest: 0152 hours  DUI #: 23-021 (Cumberland Barrack)  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING  * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Recipient in 2015 for the Maryland State Police DUI Award. * Distinguished graduate of the University of Marylands DUI Institute. * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. * Certified Standardized Field Sobriety Instructor Police Instructor through MPCTC. * Certified Preliminary Breath Test Instructor through MPCTC.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 2/19/23 at approximately 0134 hours, I was working a moving radar assignment in the area of W/B I-68 prior to Greene St., Cumberland, Allegany County, MD 21502 when I observed a silver 2012 Kia Forte passenger vehicle (WV REG: DZR835) that appeared to be traveling above the posted speed limit of 40 mph. At that time, I activated a Golden Eagle II radar unit assigned to MSP C-13, placed it in the front moving mode and targeted the Forte. I obtained a speed reading of 54 mph. I noted no other vehicles were in the radars field of influence and it had a clear and unobstructed view of the Forte. I noted the Forte was traveling in lane 2. I activated my emergency equipment and the Forte took 1:10 to come to a stop. The Forte stopped on the right shoulder prior to Seton Dr.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I conducted a drivers side approach and made contact with, Lisa Marie Payton, who was later identified by her Maryland drivers license photograph. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside of the vehicle. I advised Payton the reason for stop. I asked Payton where she was coming from and she advised Uncle Jacks Bar in the Cumberland, MD. I asked Payton if she consumed any alcoholic beverages and she stated I only had two drinks. Payton advised she had two Budweiser brand beers. I observed Paytons eyes to be bloodshot, glassy and her movements were slow and lethargic. Paytons speech was slurred. I asked a second time how many alcoholic beverages she consumed and she advised three total drinks. Payton stated a Michelob Ultra brand beer and two Budweiser brand beers earlier in the evening. I returned to my patrol vehicle to dispatch Paytons information. I returned to Paytons vehicle and asked her to step out of the vehicle and preform voluntary Standardized Field Sobriety testing and she stated I dont mind. I noted Payton placed her right hand on the drivers door for balance as she exited. I asked Payton to the rear of her vehicle for safety. In speaking with Payton I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Paytons breath and person. Payton advised her last alcoholic beverage was at 1:15 am. I asked Payton a third time how many alcoholic beverages did she consume and advised the three alcoholic beverages. Payton then began the voluntary tests.   PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the roadway. The surface was dry, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 40 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of my spotlight, vehicle headlights and street lights.  I asked Payton the following questions:  Injuries  Advised she had a knee injury in 2002 from a car accident. Medication  None Medical Conditions  No. Glasses/Contacts  Not observed  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my finger was used as the stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Paytons eyes. She was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes, until told to stop. Paytons pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting nystagmus was observed. She was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked Payton if she understood the instructions and she stated Yes. (NOTE: Payton continually swayed to the left and right side and backwards during the entire test.)   1.) I observed Lack of Smooth Pursuit in both of her eyes. 2.) I observed Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation in both her eyes. 3.) I observed Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both her eyes.    I continued to detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Paytons breath and person.   WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed)  Prior to Payton performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Payton was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe. Payton was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Payton was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Payton was to keep her hands flat at her side, keeping her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Payton was explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around. Payton was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps and instructed that they were to be performed identical to the first series. Payton was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping her hands down by her side, looking down at her feet, and counting each step out loud. I asked Payton if she understood the test and she stated, Yes.  Payton removed her shoes for the test and appeared to have difficulty removing them.   Instructional Stage: 1.) I observed Payton sway side to side and back and forth by approx. 12 inches during the instructional portion of the test, lost balance and failed to remain in the demonstration phase of the test.  Walking Stage (1st Nine): 1.) Took 4 steps and stopped.  2.) Raised her arms to shoulder height on the first 4 steps. 3.) Payton advised she messed the test up and returned to the beginning to start over. 4.) Payton missed heel to toe contact on step 6 pf the test by 3 inches. 5.) Payton took a total of 8 steps. 6.) Payton stopped and turn 90 degrees to her left and took 3 steps. Payton asked What do I do now. I advised Payton again she needed to walk back on the straight line she started with. Payton returned to the line.   Walking Stage (2nd Nine):  1.) Payton raised her right arm to shoulder height trying to maintain balance.  2.) Payton missed heel to toe contact by 3 inches on steps 5,6,7 and 8 of the final nine steps.   Turn: Incorrectly  1.) Payton stopped during the turn and asked what she needed to do.   ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)  Prior to Payton performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Payton was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised she was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Payton if she understood the test and she stated, Yes. (Footwear: removed)  Instructional Stage: 1.) I observed Payton sway side to side and back and forth by approx. 15 inches during the instructional portion of the test.  Balance and Count Stage:  Seconds 0-10: 1.) Swayed body to the left and right during entire count. 2.) Payton put her foot down on the 1 second mark.  Seconds 11-20: 1.) Swayed body to the left and right during entire count. 2.) Payton placed her foot down on the 10 second mark and did not pick her foot back up until the 17 second mark.. 3.) Payton raised her arms for balance approx. 15 inches.  Seconds 21-30: 1.) Swayed body to the left and right during entire count. 2.) Payton placed her foot down on the 29 second mark. Payton refused a preliminary breath test.    ARREST:  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Payton was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.  * Exeeding Speed Limit *1:10 seconds to come to a stop. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Head and body movements slow and lethargic. * Slurred speech. * Failing to maintain balance while standing. * Admission to consuming Budweiser and Michelob beer * Swaying body while standing. * Incriminating statements. * My observed signs of impairment as she performed field sobriety tests. * Repeated instructions * Strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person.  I arrested Payton for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0152 hours and she was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Cumberland Barrack for processing. During the transportation to the barrack I detected the strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from inside my patrol vehicle. After arriving at the barrack, Payton was read her DR-15 Advice of Rights form. Payton signed the DR-15 at approximately 0225 hours and refused the breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:  I was with Payton during the entire process and she did not leave my sight .  INTOXIMETER RESULT:  *****REFUSED*****  Payton was polite and cooperative during the process.  All events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
