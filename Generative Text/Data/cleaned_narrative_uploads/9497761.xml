Narrative:  This report has been prepared based upon the observations of this trooper and/or those of other troopers relative to the offense(s). The facts contained herein are intended solely to give the prosecuting authority a basic understanding of the facts pertaining to this case. The facts contained herein are not intended to be an exhaustive recitation of the facts pertaining to pretrial or trial issues. Instead, this trooper anticipates that during the pretrial proceedings in this case, the prosecutor will take the opportunity to interview this trooper in order to ascertain any and all relevant facts which might be the subject of this troopers testimony during court proceedings.  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion: On the night of April 8th, 2023, I was on proactive patrol along U.S. Route 13 in Princess Anne, Somerset County, Maryland. At approximately 2311 hours, I was traveling northbound in lane one on U.S. Route 13 at MD Route 822 when I observed a black Ford Explorer two cars in front of me. When the car directly in front of me changed lanes to pass the Explorer, the Explorer drove approximately half of the vehicles width into lane two, forcing the passing vehicle onto the shoulder. The Explorer corrected back into lane one before again crossing into lane two by a little more than half of the vehicles width. The Explorer corrected itself into lane one before activating its right turn signal to move over. Once the vehicle moved over, I observed the Explorer cross the solid white fog line by approximately one tire width. At that time, I activated my emergency equipment and performed a traffic stop on the vehicle. I was able to identify the license plate as 6EB2149, through the State of Maryland. The final location of the traffic stop was northbound U.S. Route 13 at Somerset Avenue N. I never lost sight of this vehicle during the observation process.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact: I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the passengers door where I contactedthe operator, later identified as Dericco Akeem Farrare (DOB: 12/21/1985) via his Maryland Drivers License. I introduced myself, stated the reason for the traffic stop, and advised him that he was being audibly and visually recorded. Farrare advised the reason for his driving was because he was on the phone with his wife.I immediately detected a moderate but distinct odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the drivers compartment of the vehicle. I observed Farrares eyes to be bloodshot and glassy.  I asked Farrare for his license and registration. As he was grabbing his information, I asked him where he was coming from. Farrare replied Uh, Princess Anne before handing me his Drivers License. I asked Farrare where he was driving to and he advised Fruitland. Farrare also possessed a Maryland Drivers License with a J restriction, but was operating a vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock system.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening: I asked Farrare to exit the vehicle, and he did as I asked. As he exited the drivers seat, I observed him to be wearing a gray windbreaker jacket, blue jeans, and a black hat that he had on backwards. His movements exiting the vehicle were very slow and lethargic. I asked Farrare to stand at the front of his vehicle while I asked him a few questions. While he walked to the front of the car, Farrare could barely walk straight. As I spoke with Farrare outside the vehicle, I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I asked him if he had anything to drink that night. He initially stated No, but when I followed up with the same question he advised One beer.  Based on Farrares driving that I observed and his admission to drinking paired with the odor of alcohol, he was offered field sobriety testing as a means to determine his level of impairment. He refused to participate in the field sobriety testing.  Arrest and Transport  At 2316 hours, I placed Farrare under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol. Farrare was placed into the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. Upon entering the drivers seat of my vehicle, I continued to detect an odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present prior to placing Farrare in my vehicle. Back at the barrack, I performed a secondary search and checked Farrare s mouth for foreign objects. I did not locate any foreign objects. I then pulled up a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, sat it in front of Farrare, and asked if he could see the form. Farrare advised that he could, and I played the DR-15 audio directly from the MVA website, having Farrare follow along. After the reading was complete, Farrare stated that he would NOT like to submit a breath sample.  Breath Test  Refused.  Charging  Farrare was charged with the following:    DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL  DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE IMPAIRED BY ALCOHOL  FAILURE TO OBEY A TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICE  RECKLESS DRIVING VEHICLE IN WANTON AND WILLFUL DISREGARD FOR SAFETY OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY  NEGLIGENT DRIVING VEHICLE IN CARELESS AND IMPRUDENT MANNER ENDANGERING PROPERTY, LIFE AND PERSON  DRIVER CHANGING LANES WHEN UNSAFE  DRIVING VEHICLE IN VIOLATION OF RESTRICTED LICENSE REQUIREMENTS  DRIVING VEH. NOT EQUIPPED WITH AN IGNITION INTERLOCK SYSTEM AS REQ. BY PROGRAM  Farrare was given all appropriate documentation and released to his sober wife, Ashley Niccole Pitts (DOB: 8/31/1988) at 0017 hours without incident.  All events did occur in Somerset County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
