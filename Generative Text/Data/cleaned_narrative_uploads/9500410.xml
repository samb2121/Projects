         <NarrativeText>*BODY-WORN CAMERA ACTIVATED* CASE NUMBER: 23-MSP-020188 OTHER CASE NUMBER(S): 23-MSP-020187 DUI NUMBER: 23-088 DUI CITATION NUMBER: 1WK0V1W  TRAFFIC CRIME: Driving Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol DEFENDANT: KIMPEL, GILBERT RODNEY  DATE OF BIRTH: 11/07/1965 LICENSE STATE  NUMBER: (MD) MD-10273579801 COMMERCIAL DRIVERS LICENSE: No  VEHICLE INFORMATION: 2015 Black Mercedes-Benz GK3 (MD: 0Z8963) COMMERCIAL VEHICLE: No LOCATION OF INCIDENT: 17 Pennsylvania Avenue, North East, Maryland 21901 DATE  TIME OF ARREST: 06/05/2023 at 1925 hours SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER: No ACCIDENT INVOLVED: No WEATHER  SURFACE: Clear Weather  LIGHTING: Daylight TYPE OF TEST: Alcohol Concentration Test (REFUSED)   SCENE PROCESSING: * Arrest for DUI/DWI * SFSTs Offered (Refused) * PBT Offered (Refused)  BARRACK PROCESSING: * DR15 (Advice of Rights) * DR15A (Officers Certification  Order of Suspension) * Traffic Citations  CERTIFICATES  TRAINING: * I am trained and certified to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) and Preliminary Breath Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * I am trained and certified to administer Advanced Roadside Impairment Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * I am trained and certified to administer Drug Recognition Expert Evaluations (DRE) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  * I have attended and successfully completed the Advanced Driving Under the Influence training course through the Maryland State Police S.P.I.D.R.E. Team.  * I have successfully completed the Marijuana DUI Investigation online course through the Central Valley California HIDTA.  * I attended the six-month Maryland State Police Academy in Sykesville, Maryland. While there, I was also trained in the detection, identification and processing of numerous controlled dangerous substances. Prior to becoming a Maryland State Trooper, I was a prior Police Officer for approximately four years in the State of Pennsylvania working in high crime areas (Cities of Philadelphia and Chester) known for drug trafficking. During my time as a Maryland State Trooper, I was temporarily assigned for approximately six months to the Wicomico County Narcotics Task Force (WINTF) where I assisted with investigations involving Controlled Dangerous Substances. I have also attended specialized training involving the possession, sale, and processing of controlled dangerous substances, and continue to do so.  NARRATIVE:  PHASE #1  VEHICLE IN MOTION:  On Monday, June 5, 2023, at approximately 1854 hours, I, TFC. M. Hughes #7111 responded with TFC. Desai #7045 to the area of 17 Pennsylvania Avenue, North East, Maryland 21901 for a possible fight in progress. While on scene assisting TFC. Desai, I made contact with two individuals who were involved in the incident. The two were identified as Gilbert Rodney Kimpel DOB: 11/07/1965 and Melanie W. Mulvena DOB: 12/29/1967.   PHASE #2  PERSONAL CONTACT:   While interviewing Kimpel and Mulvena, I asked what happened. They both began telling their side of incident at the same time, and kept talking over each other making it hard to hear. Mulvena then walked away, and I spoke to Kimpel one on one. As Kimpel spoke, I detected an extremely strong odor of alcoholic beverages coming from his breath/person. The odor was so intense, it smelt like an actual bar.   As Kimpel told his story, he kept mentioning hes blind; however, he came to the aforementioned address to fight the complainant over a neighbor dispute (see TFC. Desais Incident Report (23-MSP-020187)). Kimpel then began pointing out other people who were involved, which proved he was able to see with his right eye.    During our conversation, Kimpel was observed unsteady on his feet as he staggered and swayed. Kimpels speech was heard as slurred and his right eye was observed as bloodshot. It was clear that Kimpel was overtly intoxicated.    I next interviewed Mulvena one on one, who reported she drove Kimpel to the scene. Mulvena began crying showing a variety of emotions. Her speech was also heard as slurred, and she had a strong odor of alcoholic beverages coming from her breath/person.    After interviewing Kimpel and Mulvena, I spoke to the complainant before advising TFC. Desai about my observed signs of impairment that Mulvena displayed. As I was informing TFC. Desai, Kimpel got into the drivers seat of the blocked-in vehicle, and drove the vehicle into the neighbors driveway from the roadway.    PHASE #3  PRE-ARREST SCREENING:  I asked Kimpel to participate in Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Kimpel agreed to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. I began by advising Kimpel to put his feet together. Kimpel reported he couldnt put his feet together. I asked him why he couldnt put his feet together. Kimpel advised because hes blind. I said that doesnt mean you cant put your feet together. Kimpel then said he can do that, and put his feet together.   PRE-SCREENING QUESTIONS:  I asked Kimpel a series of questions prior to performing Standardized Field Sobriety Tests:  * Glasses/Contacts: No Im blind totally. Im blind in my good eye to. * Medications or Drugs: Yes, steroids. Lots of steroids. * Injuries/Disabilities: Injuries: Yes, my eye. Disabilities: Im blind.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST:    I attempted to explain the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN) to Kimpel: however, he kept interrupting me advising he cant see, and that hes blind. Kimpel refused this test, so I went on to the Walk and Turn Test.  WALK  TURN TEST:  WEATHER: Clear SURFACE: Level pavement. FOOTWEAR: Hey Dudes    I proceeded by attempting to explain the Walk and Turn Test to Kimpel; however, he became uncooperative again stating he cannot perform the test because he cannot see and his equilibrium was messed up. Kimpel continued to argue with me before refusing all tests.  ONE LEG STAND TEST:  N/A  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST:  Offered, but refused.  DUI ARREST:    Based on the following, I had reason to believe Kimpel was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol:  * Kimpels eye observed as bloodshot * Kimpels person and breath emitting an extreme odor of alcoholic beverages  * Kimpel observed with an unsteady walk * Kimpel observed swaying * Kimpels slurred speech * Kimpel observed with a drunk-like behavior * Kimpels unwillingness to cooperate  * My observed signs of impairment  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:   While at Maryland State Police Barrack F North East, I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights to Kimpel while providing him with a copy of the DR-15 to follow along with; however, Kimpel said he couldnt follow along because he was blind. After reading Kimpel the DR-15, he refused to the alcohol concentration test. Kimpel then refused to sign the DR-15 at approximately 1955 hours.  ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION TEST:  INSTRUMENT SERIAL NUMBER: 011750 CERTIFIED EXPIRATION DATE: 06/30/2023 TEST TECHNICIAN AVAILABLE: Sgt. Black  N/A (REFUSED)  DISPOSITION: After processing, Kimpel was placed in the cell. Mulvena was then offered the test by TFC. Desai. Mulvena agreed to take the test, then she gave a breath specimen which was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .29 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Based on my experience and observed signs of impairment displayed by Kimpel and Mulvena, it is my opinion that Kimpel was far more impaired than Mulvena. Both were released to their friend, a sober driver, in the front lobby at Maryland State Police Barrack F North East. Kimpel was given copies of all pertinent paperwork.    Kimpel was extremely uncooperative during the traffic stop.    All times in this report are approximate. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
