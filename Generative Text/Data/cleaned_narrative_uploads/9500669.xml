         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police, Barrack D Marked MSP Vehicle D-17. In-Car Camera Operational.  Defendant: Goode, Daquan Antonio Date of Birth: 06/05/1996 Date of Arrest: 07/25/2023 Time of Arrest: 1253hours DUI #: 23-186(Bel Air) Blood test Result: .16 Br AC  BEHAVIOR/CONDUCT:Goode was restless and cooperative               3 TIMES REPEAT OFFENDER   Witness: Gischel, Robert Benjamin Date of Birth: 10/13/1989 Driver license#:MD10273132473 Driver license state: Maryland Cellphone: (443) 306-2839  CERTIFICATION  TRAINING NHSTA Trained/certified to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) Preliminary breath test operator certified Certified Radar/Laser Operator  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On 25 July 2023 at approximately 1154hours, I, Trooper Kumador #7052 of the Maryland State Police, Bel Air Barrack was dispatched to 215 Philadelphia Road, Joppa, Harford County, Maryland in reference to a two motor vehicle collision. I arrived on scene and observed a Gold Lexus GS Ford F-150displaying MD registration 9EX2350 crashed into the rear of a White Isuzu Street Sweeper Truck displaying Maryland registration 7DN7947. Both were in the middle of the roadway.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with both drivers. I identified the at fault driver by his Maryland drivers license as Goode, Daquan as indicated above. Goode stated he is the registered owner and the driver of the Lexus and was traveling westbound behind the Sweeper. He stated that the Sweeper slowed down and he was not able to slow down in time and as a result, he struck the Sweeper. The Sweeper driver also collaborated on Goodes story. While speaking with Goode, I was overwhelmed with the odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath. I asked Goode how much he had to drink and he stated multiple times that he had not consumed any alcoholic beverage. Goode admitted to smoking Cannabis about an hour before the collision. He stated that he was on his way to get lunch. Goodes eyes were heavily bloodshot and glassy. He appeared calm but extremely talkative. At one point I observed him crying with his hands on his head.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)   Based on his admission to smoking cannabis about an hour before the collision, the overwhelming odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath, bloodshot and glassy eyes and his inability to operate his vehicle safely resulting into collision, I had reasons to believe that Goode driving under the influence of alcohol and a controlled dangerous substance. I asked Goode to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to which he agreed. The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder in front of my patrol vehicle. The shoulderwasflat and free of any debris and the temperature was approximately 81 degrees.I asked Goode the following questions: Contacts-No,Glasses-Yes, andAny Injuries-No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the Tests stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Goodes eyes. Hewas instructed to look straight ahead, keeping hishead still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with hiseyes until told to stop. I asked himif he understood the directions, and he advised yes. His pupils were equal in size and did show equal tracking.    Lack of Smooth Pursuit-present  The distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviationpresent  The onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degreespresent.   WALK AND TURN (6/8) Before Goode performed the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel-to-toe. He was instructed to place hishands flat at hisside and to remain in the position until told to begin. Hewas advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. He was to keep his hands flat at hisside, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step out loud. On the ninth step, he was demonstrated and explained to keep hislead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around to hisleft with hisrear foot to turn completely around. He was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. He was then instructed that once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hisside, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud.  During the instructional stage:I explained and demonstrated the starting position to Goode andplaced him in thestarting position.  Walking stage (1st Nine).    Missed heel-to-toe by more than an inch on steps 2 and 3.  He stepped offline on step 3.  He stopped walking on the 3rd step and was asking questions  He raised his arms for support more than 6 inches. His arms were at shoulder level throughout the test.  He took 8 steps instead of 9.   Turn:  The turn was unsatisfactory. Goode did notturn as he was instructed, instead of planting his left foot, he turned hopping on both feet.  Walking stage (2nd Nine).    Missed heel-to-toe by more than an inch on the first three steps  He raised his arms for support more than 6 inches. His arms were at shoulder level throughout the test.   ONE LEG STAND (2/4) Prior to Goode performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to stand with hisheels together and hands down by hisside, while the instructions were given and during the test. He was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of hischoice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While hisleg was raised, he was to keep hisleg straight, watch hisraised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two), and to continue the test until told to stop.    He swayed side by side during the test.  He used his arms for support. His arms were stretched at shoulder level  He did not raise his foot as instructed.  He started the test while I was demonstrating the test to him   PRELIMINARY BREATH A preliminary breath test was offered to Goode and he declined.  ARREST Based on the following, I havereasons to believe that Goode was operating his vehicle while impaired by alcoholand drugs and unable to operate it safely    Extremely strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting on his breath.  Admission to consuming cannabis an hour before the collision,  Unsafe operation of motor vehicle resulting into motor vehicle collision  Observed signs of impairment as he performedthe Standardized Field Sobriety Tests unsatisfactorily.  I arrested Goode at 1253hours for driving his vehicle while impaired by alcohol and drugs. A wingspan search of his vehicle uncovered a large empty can of Heineken Beer. Goode listened to the Englishaudio version of DR-15 Advice of Rights in its entiretyin my patrol vehicle. He was also provided with a paper copy of DR-15 at the barrack and at the conclusion, he voluntarily agreed tosubmit to the intoximeter test.  20-MINUTES OBSERVATION PERIOD. Goodes oral cavity check was completed at 1253 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: Breath test was explained and offered to Goode by Cpl. Atkinson #5623 with a result of .16 Br AC. Goode later admitted to consuming two shots of Vodka about an hour before the collision.  Goodewasgiven copies of all pertinent paperwork andlater released to a sober licensed driver at the barrack.  Closed by arrest.  All events occurred in HarfordCounty, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
