         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on body worn camera.   CRIME SCENE PROCESSING:    Nothing of evidentiary value was observed at the scene.   NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK:    Due to the nature of the incident, a neighborhood check was not conducted.   NARRATIVE:    On Sunday, January 22, 2023 at approximately 0228 hours, ST J.W. Merritt #5693 and I, Cpl. Z.B. Brinkman #5328, were dispatched the area of westbound Interstate 68 near mile marker 67, Little Orleans, Allegany County, Maryland regarding an unconscious subject on which a passerby was performing CPR. While en-route, we were advised that the passerby got the subject breathing again and upon arrival of emergency medical services we were advised that the subject was in full arrest.    Upon my arrival, I located and interviewed the complainant / witness, Danah Sayers at the rear of her vehicle, a gray 2012 Mercedes-Benz E-350, bearing Maryland registration 2EE1391. Sayers was not a passerby, but a traveling companion of the patient. Sayers advised that she and the patient, later identified as Wesley Joseph Van Nostrand, III by his Florida Identification card were traveling from Harford County, Maryland to Nevada to see her daughter. Sayers advised that she did not know Wesley real well, but she needed a licensed driver to drive her to Nevada because her privilege to drive is revoked. She advised that they stopped at the rest stop at Sideling Hill and Wesley advised that he thought he was going to have a heart attack, but did not complain of pain. She advised that he used the mens room, then waited outside the womens room for Sayers to exit. Upon her exit, she offered to drive for a while and Wesley accepted. It was later determined that neither Sayers nor Wesley possess a valid drivers license. Sayers advised that a little while after leaving the rest area, she noticed Wesley slumped in the front passenger seat and thought he was joking. She then realized that he wasnt joking and wasnt breathing. She stated that she stopped the vehicle on the shoulder, exited and ran around the vehicle to his door and placed her ear against his chest and did not hear a heart beat, so she called 911 and began CPR with Wesley still seated in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. She advised that eventually she heard his heart beating very loudly and rapidly, until it began to fade again. Allegany County Emergency Medical Services personnel arrived on the scene and moved Wesley to the cot in the ambulance and began CPR using a LUCAS device. Eventually a regular heart rhythm was obtained, but Wesley was intubated to assist his breathing and he was transported to UPMC Western Maryland by ambulance for further treatment. At the hospital, Wesley was given Narcan and realized a near immediate reaction, attempting to remove the breathing tube and move about. He was then sedated for his safety, never regaining consciousness, but was in a stable condition. I followed the ambulance to the hospital while ST Merritt arranged for Buckleys towing to respond to tow the vehicle and Sayers to the hospital due to her revoked privilege to drive. The pair were traveling with Sayers 13-year-old dog and small cat. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted at the scene nor in Wesleys possession.    Due to the reaction to the Narcan treatment, it is evident that Wesley experienced an opiate overdose. He never regained consciousness to answer any questions. Due to the above facts, I respectfully request the case be considered CLOSED.   CASE STATUS: CLOSED    </NarrativeText>
