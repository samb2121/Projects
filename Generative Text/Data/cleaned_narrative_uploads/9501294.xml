         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E) TEAM* MVR Statement: The following incident was captured on in-car and Body camera. Title: BROWN N 23-239. ID: 23-MSP-038883 Arrested: Brown, Dimar Byrell. Certification and training  -Trained in Field Sobriety Test through Maryland State Police Academy.  -Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E)  -Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  - Graduated from The Institute of Advanced Law Enforcement Studies Driving Under the Influence Institute-University of Maryland.  - I am a certified EC/IR II Intoximeter operator.  - I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor.  - I have apprehended more than 270 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date. VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)    On November 04, 2023, at approximately 0254 hours, I, TFC. I. Riba Tankari # 7058 with Maryland State Police was traveling northbound MD-650 north of Lockwood Drive, Montgomery County, Maryland in lane #1 (left lane). My issued patrol vehicle is Maryland State Police unmarked unit DUI-6. At that time, I observed a black Honda Civic bearing Maryland registration 4DR4587 traveling northbound MD-650 in lane #1 was unable to stay within a single lane. I observed the Honda had crossed the dotted white line from lane #1 into lane #2 (middle lane) by one tire width on one occasion before changing lane into lane #2. I followed the Honda and observed the vehicle had swerved to the left towards the dotted white line then to the right crossing the dotted white line into lane #3 (right lane) by one tire width then changed lane into lane #1. I continued to follow the Honda and observed the vehicle had swerved to the right towards the dotted white line and drove on the line on several occasions. On one occasion, I observed the Honda had swerved from lane # 1 into the left turning lane by more than half vehicle width then swerved back into lane #1. I again observed the Honda had swerved to the right towards the dotted white then swerved to the left towards the solid yellow line and continued traveling in lane #1. I initiated a traffic stop on the Honda using my emergency equipment. The Honda came to a stop in the area of northbound MD-650 and Thomas Drive, Montgomery County, Maryland in lane #3. PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)  I approached the Honda on the driver side and made contact with the driver (the sole occupant) of the vehicle. I introduced myself and explained to him the reason for the traffic stop. I asked the driver where he was coming from, and he stated a party, I live like five minutes away, I am just sleepy trying to get home. Prior to my request the driver handed me his drivers license, I then requested his registration card. I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I observed that the driver had watery and glassy eyes. While speaking with the driver I noticed his speech was slow and mumbled. I observed the drivers movements were slow while he was looking for his registration card. The driver was identified through his Maryland drivers license as Brown, Dimar Byrell. I returned to my patrol vehicle and notified the barrack who I was out with. I returned to the Honda and requested Brown to exit his vehicle and walk to the front of his vehicle and he complied. While outside his vehicle, I noticed Brown had something in his mouth that I did not observe on my first approach. I then asked him what he had in his mouth and he stated gum. I requested him to get rid of it, and he complied.  I asked Brown how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed he stated, Like three, it is my birthday. I again asked him what kind drink, and he stated three drinks, two Captain Morgan and one beer. I asked him is that bottle or cup, and he stated they were cups. I asked him around what time, and he stated like an hour and half ago. While speaking with Brown outside his vehicle, I again detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I asked Brown to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, and he agreed.  The evaluation surface was dry, flat, and free of debris. No surface defects were observed. My patrol flashlight and his vehicle headlights lit the area. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Brown appeared to be in good physical conditions. I asked Brown the following questions: Medical conditions: Thyroid. Medications: Synthroid 150 milligram for Thyroid and his last one was eight hours ago. Anything that will prevent you from walking on straight line or standing on one leg: No Glasses or contact: No. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: (6/6 clues observed). The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. - Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus - Lack of Smooth Pursuit  Present in both eyes - Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes Notes: * During the HGN test, I continued to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Browns breath. WALK AND TURN: (5/8 clues observed). The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Instructional Stage: Brown lost his balance to the right on several occasions then to left on three separate occasions and had difficulty staying in the instructional position. Brown started too soon on four separate occasions. Notes * oh thats difficult, I cant do that regular. * I have spinal difficulty, thats gonna be hard, but okay, I can do my best.

Notes *Im just trying to go home, Im a doctor. *While PBT loading results, I again asked Brown how many drinks he had, and he stated I had three, maybe four. ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Brown was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely:  -Unable to stay within a single lane/driving patterns.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from vehicle.  -Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath as he conversed with me.  -Glassy and watery eyes.  -Speech slow and mumbled.  -His admissions to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving.  -Observed signs of impairment as he performed the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.    - Preliminary Breath Test result of .12 BrAC.  Brown was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a motor vehicle at 0319 hours and was transported to the Montgomery County Silver Spring police station. A search incident to arrest revealed no weapons or contraband. Upon arrival at the station, Brown was given a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, and it was read to him first from the MVA website then later read to him in English, and he elected to consent to the Intoximeter EC/IR II test at 0419 hours. While at precinct, Brown was uncooperative, talkative and argumentative. Brown kept interrupting me while reading the DR-15 Advice of Rights to him. 20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Brown at 0335 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. He remained in my custody from that time. Nothing was introduced to his mouth at any time. The test was conducted by Officer Skelton #9312 of the Montgomery County Police department on a certified instrument and a result of .14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath was obtained at 0434 hours. After the test, Brown refused to sign the MSP 33 (Notification to defendant of result of test for alcohol concentration) form. Brown was given pertinent paperwork, released from the Station and transported to his residence pending an appearance in the District Court of Maryland for Montgomery County at a later date.  All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
