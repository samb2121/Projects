         <NarrativeText>  On 10/19/2023 at approximately 0430 hours, Sgt. Gaines #6056 of the Maryland State Police Rockville Barrack was assigned as the night shift duty officer when a citizen entered the barrack lobby to report she was assaulted during a road rage incident. After being provided with that information, Sgt. Gaines activated his body worn camera and proceeded to conduct an initial interview of the victim in the barrack lobby. The victim who was later identified by her Maryland drivers license as, Yeni Lissette SANTOS GALO, H/F, dob: 06/27/1974 told Sgt. Gaines on 10/17/2023 at approximately 1535 hours, she was traveling on the exit from Connecticut Ave, onto the inner loop of Interstate 495 in North Kensington, Maryland when she encountered mechanical problems with her vehicle. Also traveling inside the vehicle with SANTOS GALO was a passenger named: Jose HERNANDEZ, H/M, approximately 22 years old.    Shortly after the problems began, SANTOS GALO reported her vehicle stopped directly in the far left lane, causing it to block the traffic behind her. SANTOS GALO then stated, after stopping she noticed a white female who was operating a white van behind her becoming visually angry and yelling at SANTOS GALO. As SANTOS GALO continued the account of the events, she stated the white woman, approached the drivers side of her vehicle, reached inside her car window and grabbed a cellular phone from SANTOS GALO. After grabbing the cellular phone from SANTOS GALO, the white female threw the cellular phone to the ground which resulted in the victims phone being permanently damaged. SANTOS GALO described the suspect as a white woman, wearing glasses, and a tom-boyish appearance. After the suspect returned to the white van, SANTOS GALO exited her vehicle to retrieve her damaged phone from the ground. After which, the victim, who was now standing alongside her vehicle, immediately noticed the white van driving toward, and swerving in her direction, and subsequently striking her in the body. She also recalled during the collision, both of the vans tires ran directly over both of her feet. SANTOS GALO continued to recall she was also specifically struck by the side and mirror of the white van.      After striking SANTOS GALO, the white van failed to remain at the scene of the incident, and quickly left the area. As it was leaving, the passenger HERNANDEZ successfully captured a photograph of the van which clearly displayed a Maryland license plate of 7EZ4022. A later check of METER/NCIC revealed the white van is currently registered to: Kimberly Ann CESSNA, W/F, dob: 08/06/1990, with an address of 2904 Allendale Road, Baltimore, Maryland, 21207. As a result of being struck by the van, SANTOS GALO sustained physical injuries and checked herself into Adventist HealthCare Medical Center White Oak to receive medical treatment. After being treated her injuries, SANTOS GALO decided to report the incident in person to the MSP Rockville Barrack.   I request this case remain open pending additional leads. All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #2 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>  On October 19, 2023, at approximately 0415 hours, Sgt. Gaines #6056 contacted the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack in Baltimore County to request their assistance in locating the Ford van, bearing Maryland tag 7EZ4022 at 2904 Allendale Road, Baltimore, MD, 21207. At approximately 0440 hours, Trooper C. Howard #7278 of the MSP Golden Ring Barrack successfully located the white Ford at the above listed address. While on scene, Trooper Howard observed the vehicle parked in the residence driveway, and the rear license place could be clearly observed, as well as the unique business logo which read Catons, Plumbing, Sewer  Drains, Water Restoration. This is the same business logo and rear Maryland registration plate that was observed striking the victim: Yeni Lissette SANTOS GALO, on October 17th, 2023. After the vehicle was positively identified, Trooper Howard captured a photograph of the suspect vehicle, then promptly left the area. After which, Trooper Howard relayed his observation, and the gathered photographed evidence to his shift supervisor, and Sgt. Gaines.    On October 21 Sgt. Gaines queried various closed law enforcement databases for the listed owner of the white van that was observed parked in the driveway on October 19, 2023. Which revealed the listed owner was Kimberly Ann CESSNA, w/f, dob, 08/06/1990, with an address of 2904 Allendale Road, Baltimore, MD, 21207. That query also revealed CESSNA was most likely employed by local business named Catons Plumbing and Drain. It should be noted this is the same company which is displayed on the exterior of the vehicle that struck SANTOS GALO. Due to above observations, previous witness statements, photographs of the suspect vehicle, and closed source law enforcement data, Sgt. Gaines believed the white van observed by Trooper Howard on October 19, at 2904 Allendale Road was the vehicle that struck SANTOS GALO on October 17.   I request this case remain open pending additional witness interviews. All events occurred in Baltimore and Montgomery County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On 10/27/2023 Sgt. Gaines obtained a likely phone number for Kimberly Ann CESSNA, W/F, dob: 08/06/1990. CESSNA the registered owner of the white Ford van bearing Maryland registration 7EZ4002. The phone number was obtained by Sgt. Gaines through a detailed query of closed source law enforcement databases. CESSNA listed phone number was 410-916-6408.    On 10/27/2023 at approximately 0600 hours, Sgt. Gaines successful contacted CESSNA by phone. After identifying himself, and notifying her of the reason for the call they began to discuss the incident. After the initial conversation started, CESSNA interrupted Sgt. Gaines, and told him her insurance company already contacted her in regard to the incident. She also went into detail admitting she was the operator of the white Ford van on 10/19/2023 at approximately 1530 hours. She also recalled in detail having a verbal altercation with a woman on Interstate 495. At the end of the phone discussion, Sgt. Gaines asked CESSNA if she would be willing to come the MSP Rockville Barrack and provide a written statement of the events. After which, CESSNA willingly said she would drive to the barrack in Rockville and willingly provide a statement of her side of the events.    At approximately 1017 hours, Kimberly Ann CESSNA arrived at the MSP barrack lobby to speak with Sgt. Gaines. Upon her arrival, Sgt. Gaines introduced himself and notified CESSNA she was being audio and visually recorded. It should be noted, CESSNA arrived at the barrack on her own free will, and the interview was conducted in the MSP Barrack lobby at the front desk.     As the discussion progressed, CESSNA immediately began to outline she was traveling in the left lane of Interstate 495 when a vehicle cut her off and subsequently stopped directly in front of her white van. After the vehicle stopped, CESSNA explained he began honking her horn at the stopped vehicle. After the vehicle failed to move from the roadway, CESSNA stated she exited her vehicle and approached the stopped vehicle and proceeded to yell at the operator of the stopped vehicle. After she concluded yelling at the operator of the stopped vehicle, CESSNA stated she returned to her van. She then stated after returning to her vehicle, she observed the female operator of the stopped vehicle exited her vehicle and stood on the left shoulder of the highway. As she continued her statement, CESSNA stated she attempted to drive around the woman on the left shoulder. And as she was passing the woman, CESSNA stated she saw the woman: backing into her vehicle, but denied striking her with the vehicle. After she began to drive away, she stated she noticed the woman and her son attempting to film her with their cellphones. During the discussion, CESSNA stated she is the only person who operates the vehicle, and did not have any passengers with her on the day of the incident. After the conclusion of the interview, Sgt. Gaines provided CESSNA with an Maryland State Police Written Witness Statement via MSP Form 076. After being provided with the form, CESSNA proceeded to fill provide a witness statement while seated inside the barrack lobby. This written statement was written on her own free will, not in the presence of Sgt. Gaines. After she concluded with her written statement, she signed the document, and handed it to Sgt. Gaines. She was later provided with a photo copy of the statement for her records. After the conclusion of the interview and written statement, CESSNA left the MSP Rockville barrack lobby.   Case remains open pending summons/warrant service. All events occurred in Montgomery County Maryland.   </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>-Incident was recorded on BWC-  On January 4th, 2024, SOG-S investigators were contacted by a Sgt Gaines regarding a wanted subject identified as Kimberly Ann CESSNA (w/f, dob: 8-6-90) that was involved in a road rage incident that occurred during his shift as Duty Officer at the Rockville Barrack. With this information, SOG-S investigators were able to conduct a complete work-up on CESSNA and were able to confirm that she resided at 2904 Allendale Road Baltimore Maryland, 21216.  On January 9th, 2024 at approximately 0430 hours, SOG-S investigators confirmed with the PCO at the Glen Burnie Barrack that the arrest warrant for CESSNA was still active. At this time, SOG-S and AACo-Gang Task Force investigators responded to the area of 2904 Allendale Road Baltimore Maryland, 21216 and took up various stationary surveillance positions around the residence in an effort to locate CESSNA. It should be noted that SOG-S investigators were wearing their agency issued tactical vests that clearly state Police and/or Trooper. After a period of surveillance on the residence, CESSNA was observed exiting the residence and quickly returning back inside the home. After a short period of time, CESSNA came back outside and entered her white Ford Transit (MD 7EZ4022). At this time, investigators were able to make contact with her without incident. The warrant was confirmed through the PCO at Glen Burnie Barrack once again. CESSNA was eventually arrested and transported to Central Booking for further processing on the open warrant at which time she was turned over to detention center personnel.  No further from SOG-S.</NarrativeText>
