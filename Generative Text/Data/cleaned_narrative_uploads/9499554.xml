         <NarrativeText>Attachments: Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report. Scene Processing: Provided my email to Osani for her to provide me with photographs of injuries stemming from the documented assaults below. Neighborhood Check: None.  Narrative:  On 08/15/2023 at approximately 1040 hours, I, Trooper Jones of the Maryland State Police - North East Barrack was on duty and dispatched to 38 Old Schoolhouse Dr. Port Deposit, MD 21904 in reference to a physical disturbance involving a male with a knife. (See TFC Nagovichs report #23-MSP-028860 pertaining to this incident)  During the time I was on-scene, I observed the female involved who was later identified as Nicole Mary Osani (W/F, DOB: 08/14/1995) and determined her to be the ex-girlfriend to the male suspect in this case. I then also identified the male suspect to be Lance David Larson (W/M, DOB: 08/12/1985). Osani stated she and Larson had been in a relationship for approximately 3 years, but is currently broken up due to the alleged physical abuse from Larson. Osani advised she has been trying to get away from Larson; however, she stated he finds her wherever she goes and continues to abuse her when he finds her.  During the incident that troopers were originally called for, Osani stated within the last year, she has been physically abused numerous times by Larson and had never gone to the hospital or reported the assaults to police. When asked if Osani could provide any information pertaining to the assaults, she stated she had dates, times, and information from 2 incidents within the last year, but only had photos from 1 of the incidents. Again, it is noted, that Osani claimed, although she only had details and photographs from 2 incidents within the last year, she stated she has been assaulted by Larson numerous more times than what was reported today.  Osani provided the following information pertaining to the 2 assaults she had information for:  On 01/08/2023 at approximately 0300 hours, Osani advised she was at her mothers house located at 26 Willard Dr, North East, MD 21901. Osani stated Larson wanted to cuddle her while laying in bed and when he wrapped his body around her person, Larson then wrapped his arm around her neck and began to choke her. Osani stated she told him to get off, and he would not which was when she tried to push him off of her. After attempting to push Larson off of her, she advised he then got on top of her and struck her in the face with a closed fist. I then asked Osani why Larson assaulted her, and she was unable to give any reasoning. Osani stated they were not arguing and things had been fine between the two. Osani also made the statement that Larson never has a reason for the things he does and described him as being psychotic. I asked Osani if she ever reported the assault to the police or if she received medical attention from the assault. Osani advised she did not report the assault or go to the hospital.  On 08/13/2023, at approximately 1100 hours, Larson approached her and struck her in the face with his right hand. I asked Osani if Larson struck her with an open or closed and hand, and she replied it was closed. I asked Osani again if she ever contacted the police or received medical attention, and she stated she did not for both. Osani also informed me she did not have any photographs of her injuries from this incident.  At that time, I provided Osani with a Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report. After completing the form with Osani, it was determined she did screen in and was urged to speak with a Domestic Violence Counselor. It is noted, prior to completing the form with Osani, she had already completed the same form with TFC Pope. During that screening, Osani opted not to speak with a counselor and again declined to speak with a counselor after being screened in by myself. Osani was then provided the case number for this incident and referred to the District Court Commissioners Office to file charges against Larson, as well as to apply for a protective order against him.  Although the date is past the year mark to file charges, Osani also informed me of an incident from 02/08/2022 at 1410 hours. Osani stated she was at the 26 Willard Dr address with Larson and 4 months pregnant at the time. Osani advised she was sitting on the bed in her bedroom when Larson walked in and stood over top of her. Out of nowhere, Osani stated Larson struck her in the face with a closed fist and then walked away. I asked what provoked him to assault her, and she advised nothing had happened to make him do that. I asked if Larson made any comments to her before or after striking her in the face, and she stated he did not. Osani also informed me she did not report the assault to law enforcement, nor did she receive any medical attention.  Osani was unable to send me the photographs of her injuries from the past assaults due to her phone not having internet or cellular connection. I will attempt to make contact with her on 08/16/2023 to retrieve those photos.  All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.  Case Status: Open  </NarrativeText>
