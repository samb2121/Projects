         <NarrativeText>Video Recordings Available:  Primary Trooper: Tpr. Tripps body worn camera operational.H-4 in-car camera operational.  Narrative:  On 6/30/2023 at approximately 1400 hours, I, Tpr. Tripp #7333, with the Maryland State Police La Plata Barrack H was traveling on Washington Avenue, in the area of Heritage Green Parkway, La Plata, Charles County, Maryland, in lane one operating H-4, when I observed a VanGo bus stopped in the right turn lane, and partially in lane one with a pedestrian in front of the bus with his shirt off, in his hand, attempting to gain access onto the bus. I exited my vehicle and approached the pedestrian and asked him why he was in the middle of the road, he stated She wont let me in. I then approached the driver of the VanGo bus (Brenda Best) and she stated, I do not want him in this bus. Best also advised she was in fear of her safety. Best explained to me the pedestrian pushed in the side mirror of the bus. I immediately advised the pedestrian to leave. He complied and returned to the Park and Ride parking lot located at 5998 Washington Avenue, La Plata, Charles County, Maryland. I approached the pedestrian and made multiple attempts to identify him. He, stated to me, Im Danzell Warner. I requested identification from him, and he refused to provide it to me.  The pedestrian walked around the parking lot, sweating profusely. While I was attempting to speak with him, he aggressively walked directly up to me within two inches from my face. I repeatedly asked him to step back. While speaking with him, I could immediately detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I observed his eyes were glassy, and his pupils were constricted. While trying to obtain details from the pedestrian, he then used his right hand to push me in my chest. I advised the pedestrian he was under arrest, and he then began running away from me. While running away, the pedestrian slipped and fell onto the pavement. He landed on his side and rolled onto his back. At that time, I got on top of the pedestrian and placed him onto his stomach. While over top of him he was actively resisting while I was trying to place the handcuffs on him.  I then used pain compliance on his right arm by grasping his forearm with my right hand and maneuvering his forearm upward with his hand touching his shoulder blade attempting to effect the arrest. Once compliance was gained, all use of force ceased. I stayed on top of the pedestrian until additional law enforcement officers arrived (PFC Tippett #648 and Ofc. Shuar #651 with La Plata Police Department). PFC Tippett was able to identify the pedestrian as Warner, Danzell Tyraze (A.A/M, DOB: 11/16/1993). Cpl. Casarella #5627 assisted on scene. While attempting to walk Warner to my vehicle, Warner became aggressive and combative. As Ofc. Shuar and I attempted to place Warner inside my vehicle, he then began to kick me and Ofc. Shuar. Using his right foot, Warner kicked me in the head and the chest. Warner then kicked Ofc. Shuar in his chest with his left foot. Ofc. Shuar held Warners legs with both hands keeping them together, and I held onto Warners upper body by placing both of my hands under his armpits and assisted Warner into the vehicle.  Ofc. Shuar then gained head and body control on Warner by placing his left hand on Warners head and his right hand on his thigh to stop him from attacking us. Due to Warner being aggressive and hostile, we determined it would be safer to transport Warner in a caged vehicle. Warner was then escorted to PFC Tippetts vehicle. Ofc. Shuar held Warners legs with both hands keeping them together, and I held onto Warners upper body by placing both of my hands under his armpits and assisted Warner into PFC Tippetts vehicle. While placing Warner in the vehicle he kicked me in the chest with his left foot and spit on Ofc. Shuar. While Warner was in the vehicle, he was spitting and kicking the rear passenger side door and window with both feet attempting to free himself.Warner was then transported to Charles County Detention Center (CCDC) to be charged.  We arrived at CCDC at approximately 1431 hours and for the duration of the transport, Warner was kicking the rear passenger door trying to free himself. While at CCDC, Warner tried to spit on me, PFC Tippett, and Ofc. Shuar. Emergency Medical Services responded to CCDC to transport him to Charles Regional Medical Center (CRMC) due to Warner appearing to be highly intoxicated. I rode inside the ambulance for the safety of the EMS personnel and Warner. Once we arrived at CRMC Warner unexpectedly unstrapped himself from the stretcher and immediately charged after me and attempted to kick me. I then reached for an under hook, gaining control of Warners right arm, and used my left foot to sweep his right foot taking, Warner to the ground. I used my left hand to give pain compliance to his right arm, and used my right arm to keep head control of Warner by extending my right arm in a locked position, with my hand on the side of his face preventing him from spitting and biting. Warner ceased his combativeness and was then escorted inside CRMC  I asked Warner to follow instructions, and he complied momentarily and was then escorted inside CRMC to be seen by Medical Doctor, Michael Anthony Frasier. TFC Cress #7102, arrived at the hospital to assist with processing. TFC Cress and I were unable to collect a PBT sample or obtain a statement from Warner due to his aggressive and agitated behavior. Warner was then medically cleared from CRMC and transported back to CCDC by Charles County Sheriffs Office Cpl. Austin #376. While in the parking lot of CCDC, Cpl. Austin handed off Warner to TFC Cress. TFC Cress waited in the parking lot for me to gather all necessary documents before we went inside the detention center. At this time, Warner attempted pulling away from the grasp of TFC Cress. Warner was leaning away and extending his legs to break free from the grasp TFC Cress had on his right arm.  TFC Cress was standing near the entrance gate of CCDC with his left hand grasping Warners right tricep and bicep muscles in the escort position. TFC Cress pulled Warner back closer to me. Warner attempted to break his grasp again by utilizing the same technique. TFC Cress responded by pulling Warner closer to him again. Warner was yelling at TFC Cress that he did not need to be held and that he was not waiting any longer. Warner attempted to break his grasp a third time. On the third attempt TFC Cress grabbed his left arm, on his tricep and bicep muscles, with his left hand he put his right arm between Warners left arm and left shoulder blade. TFC Cress grasped his left trap muscle with his right hand, and he forced Warners upper body to lean forward to limit his ability to utilize his legs and hip power to pull away from him.  TFC Cress had his right arm underneath Warners elbow and utilized body mechanics by raising Warners elbow and forcing his upper body forward to limit his ability to create leverage and pull away from TFC Cress. TFC Cress escorted Warner up the steps towards the exterior door of the detention center. At this time, I put my left arm in between Warners right arm and right shoulder blade. I then assisted TFC Cress in escorting Warner through the door into the detention center. Warner continued to try and break free of our grasp. TFC Cress and I escorted Warner to the wall of the detention center where the correctional officers search and process incoming prisoners. TFC Cress and I held him there until correctional officers were ready to take custody of Warner. Several correctional officers entered the intake area to assist with custody and control of Warner. Once Warner was in their care, no other force was used.While at CCDC, Warner became hostile and again tried to spit on TFC Cress, but missed. Warner then made the statement, I am going to kill you. towards myself and TFC Cress. I responded to CRMC at approximately 2022 hours to be seen for a medical evaluation due to blood stains from Warner transferred to me (Right side shirt pocket). I was then medically cleared with no injuries from the hospital at approximately 2138 hours. At 2202 hours, Sgt. Norman #5237 contacted the Southern Maryland Informational Center (SMIC) regarding the incident.The SMIC then broadcasted, by email, an Officer Safety Bulletin to all the southern Maryland law enforcement agencies.  After speaking with the on-call States Attorney, the recommended charges for Warner are:  AB 6-320(a)(2)-Public intoxication  AB 6-320 (a)(1)-Intoxication Endangerment  CR 3-203 1st Degree Assault  CR 3-203 2nd Degree Assault (4 counts)  CR 3-204 (a)(1) Reckless Endangerment  CR 10-201 (c)(1) Disturb peace/Hinder passage of Vehicle  CR 10-201 (c)(2) Disorderly conduct  CR 10-201 (c)(3) Failure to obey lawful order  CR 6-301 Malicious Destruction of Property under $1,000  CR 6-301 Malicious Destruction of Property over $1,000  CR 3-708 (b) Threatening state official to injure  All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On 06/30/2023, I, TFC Cress #7102, assisted Tpr. Tripp #7333, with the arrest process involving a suspect, Danzelle Tyraze Warner (AA/M DOB: 11/16/1993) who assaulted Tpr. Tripp and attempted to flee from him on foot.  Tpr. Tripp was at the hospital with Warner to be medically cleared before he went to the Charles County Detention Center. I arrived at the hospital to assist Tpr. Tripp with custody and control of Warner while at the hospital. Due to Warners physical indicators and behavior, I had reason to believe Warner was intoxicated and/or under the influence of drug(s). Warner was aggressive and uncooperative to authority and commands. I observed Warner disobey numerous commands from authority figures such as hospital staff, hospital security, and law enforcement officers. While Warner was at the hospital, he attempted to leave his hospital room on several occasions and was stopped by hospital security even though they told him several times he was not free to leave and needed to stay in his room. Warner was medically cleared by the hospital from the injuries sustained during Tpr. Tripps use of force on him to effect his arrest. A Charles County Sheriffs Office deputy, Cpl. Austin #376, transported Warner to Charles County Detention Center because his patrol vehicle was equipped with a cage.  Myself, Tpr. Tripp, Cpl. Austin, and Warner arrived at the detention center inside an open air sally port. Cpl. Austin transferred custody and control of Warner to me inside the sally port. Cpl. Austin informed Warner he was now in my custody and control and that he had to wait to go into the detention center until I escorted him in there. I was standing in the middle of the sally port with my left hand grasping Warners right arm tricep and bicep muscles. I stood there waiting on Tpr. Tripp to gather all necessary documents before we went inside the detention center. Warner attempted to break my grasp by leaning to his left, away from me, and extending his legs. I pulled Warner back closer to me. Warner attempted to break my grasp again by utilizing the same technique. I responded by pulling him closer to me again. Warner was yelling at me that he did not need to be held and that he was not waiting any longer. Warner attempted to break my grasp a third time by utilizing the same technique. On the third attempt by Warner to break free of my grasp, I grasped his left arm, on his left arm tricep and bicep muscles, with my left hand and put my right arm between his left arm and his left shoulder blade. I grasped his left trap muscle with my right hand and forced his upper body to lean forward to limit his ability to utilize his legs and hip power to pull away from me. I had my right arm underneath Warners elbow. I utilized body mechanics by raising his elbow and forcing his upper body forward to limit Warners ability to create leverage to pull away from me. I escorted Warner up the steps towards the exterior door of the detention center.  At this time, Tpr. Tripp put his left arm in between Warners right arm and right shoulder blade. Tpr. Tripp assisted me in escorting Warner through the door into the detention center. Warner continued to try and break free of our grasps with negative results. Tpr. Tripp and I escorted Warner to the wall of the detention center where the correctional officers search and process incoming prisoners. Tpr. Tripp and I placed Warner against the wall and kept him there until correctional officers took custody of Warner. Several correctional officers entered the intake area and took custody of Warner after a brief period of time. No other force was used after custody was transferred to the detention center correctional officers.  All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #2 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>The incident was captured in Body Worn Camera.  Narrative: On 6/30/2023 at approximately 1415 hours, I responded to the LaPlata Park and Ride to assist Trooper Tripp with a reported disorderly subject.  Upon my arrival, a VanGO Bus was stopped in front of the Park and Ride and Trooper Tripp, PFC Tippett #648 and Officer Shuar #651 of the LaPlata Town Police Department as well as Valencia Iyan Thomas (AA/F, DOB:9/6/1991) were standing around a male seated on the ground in the parking lot. The male seated on the ground was later positively identified as Danzell Tyraze Warner (AA/M, DOB: 11/16/1993). As Trooper Tripp, PFC Tippett and Officer Shuar escorted Warner to his vehicle, I retrieved a pair of white Nike tennis shoes and I spoke with Thomas in reference to $181 in U.S. Currency located in his short pocket. The currency was handed to me at which time I counted the currency aloud, nine $20 bills and one $1 bill. Thomas stated that was payment for home monitoring but couldnt provide documentation. While speaking with Thomas, the VanGo bus operator waved for my attention because Warner was being combative with Trooper Tripp and Officer Shuar. As I approached H-4, Trooper Tripp advised he was kicked by Warner who was seated in the front seat. Officer Shuar was using his body weight to prevent Warner from fleeing and continuing to assault them from the vehicle. Warner attempted to lunge at Officer Shuar at which time I placed by hand around Warners right bicep in a cupping motion to prevent him from lunging. I requested Emergency Medical Services to respond to the scene to check on Warner and a police vehicle equipped with a cage to transport Warner to the Charles County Detention Center. Officer Tippett advised his vehicle is properly equipped. As Trooper Tripp and Officer Shuar removed Warner from H-4 and escorted him to the LaPlata Towns Patrol vehicle Warner attempted to wrap his legs around Officer Shuars leg as which I quickly removed. Due to Warner being extremely uncooperative he was quickly transported to the Charles County Detention Center.  I remained on scene and re contacted Thomas and advised her the $181 would be transported to the Charles County Detention Center and placed in his property. She was advised to go through the legal channels to retrieve payment for the home monitoring.   I then contacted the VanGO bus driver, Brenda Best (AA/F, DOB: 10/1/1959). She advised she refused Warner service and locked the VanGO bus to prevent him from entering. She advised he pushed her passenger side mirror in and jumped on the bike rack on the front of the bus. She advised she was not assaulted by Warner but observed Warner assault the officers. She later responded to the LaPlata Barrack to provide a written statement.  I responded to the Charles County Detention Center to return Warners $181 and a pair of white Nike tennis shoes that were left on scene. While at the Detention Center Warner, was calm and then quickly became uncooperative as he was being escorted to the Ambulance to be transported to the Charles Regional medical Center for treatment due to his level of intoxication.  All events occurred in Charles County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
