         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack J-19 In-Car and Body Camera Operational Maryland State Police DUI J-23-112 LICENSE INFO: WV F688256 Cierra Elizabeth Younker W/F DOB: 06/16/1994 W/F, 785 Rock Gap Road, Berkeley Springs, WV 25411. Phone Number: 304-671-1774. TRAINING / CERTIFICATES:   Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Administration. (June 2020)   margin-left:8px"&gt;Certified RADAR / LIDAR Operator.  VEHICLE IN MOTION: (PHASE 1)  On June 16, 2023, at approximately 2107 hours, I, TFC Yu #7292 was dispatched to a call regarding a pedestrian on southbound I-97 in the area of the 4-mile marker, Crownsville. While responding to the call for service, a black BMW 328I bearing West Virginia registration DEMONIC began traveling at a high rated speed and approached me from the rear. I was traveling in lane 1 as the BMW approached me in lane 2, I observed the vehicle began to wave her arms at me. I activated my rear deck emergency lights and changed over to lane 2 to follow the BMW. The driver of the BMW pulled over to the right shoulder of westbound US Route 50 at Parole.  I approached the vehicle and identified the driver as the registered owner of the vehicle. The driver was identified as Cierra Elizabeth Younker W/F DOB: 06/16/1994. Younker appeared to be in distress while crying, she advised she had a bad night with her friend and stopped me to see if she was headed home the correct way. I checked her GPS on her cell phone and advised she was headed the correct way. Younker advised she was ok and her GPS would guide her back to West Virginia.  As we cleared the check welfare, I observed Younkers merge from the right shoulder onto lane 3 on westbound US Route 50 at Parole, Annapolis. I observed the BMW traveling in lane 3 then began to cross over the dotted white line to the right. The BMW then continued onto the gore area of the entrance ramp from Solomon Island Road to westbound US Route 50, the BMW continued from the gore area onto the entrance ramp lane. I continued to make observations as observed the BMW travel between lane 3 and the entrance ramp lane four times, between lanes 3 and 2 one time. I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop. The driver of the BMW immediately slammed the brakes, stopping in lane 2 of the ramp from westbound US Route 50 onto northbound I-97 before moving on the right shoulder. PERSONAL CONTACT:  I approached the vehicle from the passengers side and made contact with Younker. I identified myself again and advised Younker the reason for this second traffic stop. I advised Younker she was unable to maintain a single lane while driving. Younker advised she was unable to maintain lanes due to being on her cellphone. I asked Younkers to exit her vehicle to the front of her vehicle. While speaking to Younker, I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person. I also observed her eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. I asked Younker to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Younker agreed to submit to the tests. I asked Younker how much alcoholic beverages she had prior to driving, she advised none but would later admit to having a Vodka Soda at approximately 1400 hours in Ocean City Maryland. PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of westbound US Route 50 ramp to northbound I-97, Annapolis. The surface was dry and free of any obvious debris. Lighting consisted of my flashlight and vehicles headlights. Younker did not display any visible injuries or advised she was on any medication that would prevent her from performing any test. Younker advised she did not wear glasses. All SFSTs were demonstrated to Younker before her attempts. Younker was wearing a white tank top and black shorts along with white sandals. HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) TEST: 6/6 VALIDATED CLUES  For the HGN Test, I faced Younker away from the roadway. I instructed Younker to assume the instructional position, by placing her feet together, and relaxing her arms by her sides. I instructed her to hold the position as I demonstrated the test. I instructed her to follow the stimulus, a pen with her eyes only while holding her head still and straight. I instructed her to not move her head. Younker stated she understood my instructions and did not have any questions. I positioned the stimulus approximately twelve inches away from Younkers face, slightly above eye level. I conducted an initial check of Younkers eyes. I observed Younkers pupils were equal in size. I did not observe Resting Gaze Nystagmus in either eye. I observed Younkers eyes were bloodshot and glassy. During the test, I observed the following clues:    LACK OF SMOOTH PURSUIT: PRESENT IN BOTH EYES  DISTINCT AND SUSTAINED NYSTAGMUS AT MAXIMUM DEVIATION: PRESENT IN BOTH EYES  ONSET OF NYSTAGMUS PRIOR TO 45 DEGREES: PRESENT IN BOTH EYES   margin-left:8px"&gt;VERTICAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: PRESENT IN BOTH EYES  WALK AND TURN (WAT) TEST: REFUSED ONE LEG STAND (OLS) TEST: 2/4 VALIDATED CLUES For the OLS Test, I instructed Younker to assume the instructional position, by placing her feet together, and relaxing her arms by his sides. I instructed her to hold the position. She stated she understood my instructions. I explained the test to Younker and asked if she had any issues balancing on one leg. I instructed Younker to pick a leg of her choice and to raise the leg approximately 6 inches off the ground while keeping her leg straight and keeping her raised foot parallel to the ground. I demonstrated the test to her. I instructed her to look down at her raised foot, to keep both arms relaxed by her sides, to count every second out loud, and to perform the test until I instructed her to stop. I explained and demonstrated the test to Younker. I observed the following clues: BALANCE AND COUNT STAGE:    Sway: Second 2, 3 and 7.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Foot Down: Second 8 and 9  OTHER NOTES:     margin-left:8px"&gt;Younker only continued the test for approximately 11 seconds before refusing to continue.  PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT) RESULT: .181 BAC ARREST:  I placed Younker under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol at approximately 2156 hours. I transported Younker to the Annapolis Barrack for further processing. Younkers vehicle was locked and secured on the right shoulder of westbound US Route 50 ramp to northbound I-97.  At the Annapolis Barrack, I provided Younker with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, I read the form to her and explained the form to her after reading it. At 2249 hours, Younker agreed to submit to the Intoximeter Breath Test. Sgt. Watson #5509 adminstered the Intoximeter Breath Test to Younker with a result of .17 BrAC at approximately 2258 hours. Sgt. Watson completed the MSP Form 33, State of Maryland Notification to Defendant of Result of Test of Alcohol Concentration for Younker. She signed the MSP Form 33. I completed the DR-15A, Officers Certification and Order of Suspension #AJW02053 for Younker. Younker was provided all copies of her paperwork. Younker was released to her father at approximately 0024 hours by Sgt. Jones #1788. All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
