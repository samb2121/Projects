         <NarrativeText>R-29 equipped with in-car camera and body-worn camera. Contact Sgt. Twardowski (joseph.twardowski@maryland.gov) for camera footage.  Case# 23-MSP-032133 Defendant: Charles Robert Wernig Date of Birth: 09/11/1958  Date of Arrest: 09/13/2023 Time of Arrest: 0400 hours DUI #: 23-493 Citation #: 5QG0XD0 Breath Result: Refused Blood Kit   Certificates and Training *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  *Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) Certified  *Certified Emergency Medical Technician by the Maryland Institute of Emergency Medical Services Systems  *Certified RADAR/LIDAR operator by the Maryland State Police  *Certified License Plate Reader (LPR) operator by the Maryland State Police  *Apprehended over 160 impaired drivers while working as a Maryland State Trooper  *2023 Distinguished graduate of the University of Maryland DUI Institute  Vehicle In Motion (Phase 1)  On September 13th, 2023 at approximately 0330 hours I, Trooper Sigman #7376, currently assigned to the Golden Ring Barrack, was on routine patrol when the Golden Ring Barrack dispatched a lookout for a possibly impaired driver. The anonymous caller reported that a white Dodge pickup truck bearing New York registration of LDG8681 was traveling S/B on I83 prior to exit 33 and was failing to maintain a single lane of travel, drifting all over the roadway. Several minutes later the Golden Ring Barrack received a call from another anonymous caller reporting that a white Dodge Ram was stopped in lane 1 of I83 prior to exit 31. The Barrack received six additional calls about a white pickup truck with New York registration stopped in lane 1 of I83 prior to exit 31. While responding to the area another caller reported that the white Dodge Ram was now in the center grass gore area with the driver slumped over the wheel.  Personal Contact (Phase 2) I then arrived on scene and observed a white Dodge Ram pickup truck bearing New York registration of LDG8681 facing S/B in the center grass gore area. I then approached the Dodge and observed the driver, later identified by his Pennsylvania drivers license as Charles Robert Wernig (09/11/1958), leaning against the side of his vehicle. I then identified myself and asked Wernig what had happened. Wernig continued to lean against his pickup truck and stated yeah I know what you are. I have. Wernig then began to doze off and stare at the grass. Wernig struggled to put full sentences together. Wernig was then asked if he needed an ambulance to which Wernig refused. I observed that Wernig had bloodshot glassy eyes, slurred speech upon conversation, and a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I also observed that an open Four Loko alcoholic beverage was in the center console cup holder. Wernig then stated I am going to six Ruby Meadows Road. I then asked Wernig where that was located. Wernig responded right here. We are on, are you going to give me a hard time. I then advised Wernig that I had just arrived on scene and was simply trying to figure out what had happened. Wernig then stated I am going to 6 Ruby Meadows Road. I then asked Wernig what town that was located in. Wernig then stated Lake Katrine  with a zip code of One four four whatever. Its my womans address. Oh, come on guy. I then asked if that was in Pennsylvania. Wernig then stated I am from Pennsylvania and yelled at me stating that his girlfriend was in lake Katrine. I advised Wernig that I had never heard of that town and again asked what state that was located in. Wernig then told me Shes in New York and continued to be extremely hostile and argumentative with me. I then asked Wernig what state we were currently in. Wernig replied Yes! New York. I then confirmed that Wernig believed that he was currently in New York to which Wernig again advised yes. Wernig then almost fell over to which I had to grab him to prevent falling onto the grass. I then asked Wernig what time he had left his house to drive to his girlfriend in New York. Wernig replied, This afternoon Im going to her house. I then asked Wernig what time he believed it was. Wernig advised that he thought it was 830 in the evening. Wernig then asked me why he was pulled over. I then advised him that he was not pulled over and that he had run off of the road into the middle of the grass median. Wernig then stated because I had to stop because Im in pain. I then asked Wernig if he wished to go to the hospital. Wernig then yelled No! I then asked Wernig how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed prior to driving. Wernig replied none. I then advised Wernig that I could see the open alcoholic beverage in the center console. Wernig then stated That was sitting there forever. I then asked Wernig if he could walk to the front of my vehicle to complete standardized field sobriety testing. Wernig agreed. While walking, I had to hold onto Wernig to prevent him from falling over. I again asked Wernig if I could call him an ambulance due to his extreme gait ataxia. Wernig refused no, stop it.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3)  The evaluation was performed on the left shoulder of I83. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 74 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of streetlights, and overhead lights, and my vehicles takedown lights. My vehicles front facing emergency lights were deactivated for the duration of the field sobriety tests. Wernig appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries and or defects.  I asked Wernig the following questions:  Injuries- none Medical conditions- hip pain from COVID Medications- My old man drug Glasses or contacts- glasses, wearing Alcoholic beverages- denies Controlled dangerous substance- none    Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The test was explained. I then began the test. I did not observe any resting nystagmus. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus.  Lack of Smooth Pursuit - present in both eyes Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - present in both eyes Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - present in both eyes *Vertical Gaze Nystagmus - present in both eyes  Wernig leaned against the hood of my car during the entire duration of the test. Wernig displayed poor motor coordination and difficulty following directions. Wernig had to be reminded multiple times to not move his head.     Walk and Turn (Not attempted)  The walk and turn test was not attempted due to concerns of Wernig falling and injuring himself  One Leg Stand (Not attempted)  The one leg stand test was not attempted due to concerns of Wernig injuring himself    I then offered my PBT to Wernig. Wernig agreed and the results were .20 on serial #218942  I then again asked Wernig how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed prior to driving. Wernig replied Maybe two at the most. Wernig stated he was drinking the can referencing the four loko in the center console. Wernig then blurted out I shoulda went home. Wernig then clarified that he was driving from his house in York Pennsylvania to his girlfriend in New York State. Wernig was driving the complete opposite direction.  Arrest  Based on the following, I had probable cause to believe Wernig was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  *Multiple calls reporting that Wernig was unable to maintain a single lane of travel *Stopping in the middle of an active roadway *Driving into the center grass median *Believing that he was in New York *Open alcoholic beverage container in the center console *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and person *Glassy eyes *slurred speech *Gait ataxia *Admission to consuming multiple acholic beverages while driving *Poor SFST     At this time Wernig was placed under arrest for DUI. Due to my medical training and experience I then called an ambulance Wernig due to believing Wernig was suffering from alcohol poisoning. Baltimore County Fire Department Medic 60 (run number 232560502) then responded to the scene. I then had to assist Wernig into the ambulance. Wernig was then transported to York Hospital for treatment.  Search incident to arrest revealed one empty Four Loko as well as one cold 2/3 consumed Four Loko in the center cup holder.   I then followed Medic 60 and again made contact with Wernig inside the hospital. A physical copy of the DR15 was then handed to Wernig and the audio version was played aloud. At the conclusion of the audio Wernig stated that he did not wish to submit to a blood test. The time was 0236.  20-Minute Observation Period:  N/A     Intoximeter Result:  N/A  Wernig was then issued the appropriate citations as well as a DR15A. Wernig was then released to the care of York Hospital.  All above events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
