         <NarrativeText>*STATE POLICE IMPAIRED DRIVING REDUCTION EFFORT (S.P.I.D.R.E.) TEAM* The following incident was captured on in-car camera Title: DUI 23-292 R FLORES TORRES ID: 23-MSP-018986 Defendant: Irvin Flores Torres TRAINING/CERTIFICATES:    I am trained and certified in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  I am NHTSA certified Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructor as of July 2021.  I have successfully completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training as of September 2020.  I am a distinguished graduate from the University of Marylands DUI Institute as of August 2021.  I am trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police as of 2020.  I have apprehended more than 300 impaired drivers during my tenure with the Maryland State Police to date.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On May 27, 2023 at approximately 2150 hours, I (TFC. Speak #7219) was on patrol in marked Maryland State Police vehicle DUI-7 on Eastern Boulevard in the area of Maryland 43, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a black Chevrolet Silverado failing to drive within a single lane and failing to drive on the right half of the roadway. The Chevrolet was bearing Maryland registration 3BL5073.    The Chevrolet passed my marked patrol vehicle on Eastern Boulevard at the intersection of Maryland 43.  Drove on dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  Left over dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  Right over solid white lane line with approximately the entire trucks width.  Right over solid white lane line with approximately half the trucks width.  Changed into lane one.  Changed into lane two.  Left over dotted white lane line with driver side tires.  Changed into lane three.  The truck attempted to make a right turn from Eastern Boulevard onto Seamaster Road. The development that the Chevrolet was turning into has a concrete median separating the entrance and exit. The Chevrolet made a wide right turn, turning into the exit for the development, and was traveling on the wrong side of the road.  Upon observing these traffic violations, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on Seamaster Road at Canberra Drive.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I approached the Chevrolet on the driver side and made contact with the male operator of the vehicle. There were a total of three other occupants in the vehicle, one being his four year old son. I identified myself and explained the reason for the stop. I then requested his drivers license and vehicle registration. He was identified by his Maryland drivers license as Irvin Flores Torres. While speaking with Flores Torres, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from inside the vehicle. I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. Additionally, I observed his speech to be slurred. I then returned to my patrol vehicle to notify the barrack who I was out with.  I returned to the Chevrolet and requested Flores Torres to exit his vehicle. He complied and exited his vehicle. While speaking to Flores Torres outside of his vehicle, in an ambient environment, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. When asked about his consumption of alcohol prior to driving, Flores Torres stated he had two or three beers (Yuengling). When asked where he was driving from, Flores Torres stated he was coming from a wedding and was driving home. I informed Flores Torres that I wanted him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, to which he agreed to the tests.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the sidewalk off of Seamaster Road. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of patrol vehicle headlights, streetlights, and flashlight. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. He appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries. He was wearing a shirt, pants, and shoes.  I asked Flores Torres the following questions:  Glasses or contacts  None. Physical Injuries  None. Medication  None. Medical Conditions  None.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed) The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test was explained and administered per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Flores Torres noticeably swayed front to back while standing stationary for the test.    Equal pupil size and equal tracking, no resting nystagmus.     Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.  Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation  Present in both eyes.  Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees  Present in both eyes.  WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed) The test was properly explained and demonstrated per the NHTSA SFST Manual. Flores Torres stated that he understood the instructions and how the test was to be performed. He removed his shoes for the test.  Instructional Stage:    Broke the instructional position to the right three times and to the left twice.  Started too soon.  Walking Stage (1stNine):    Stepped completely offline on steps 2 and 8.  Missed touching heel to toe by more than a  inch on step 5.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Completed 10 steps instead of the instructed nine.

Seconds 11-20:    Swayed body to the left and right.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Placed raised right foot on the ground.  Seconds 21-30: Flores Torres stated, I cant do it. The test was concluded.  PBT #70005012 with a result of .17  ARREST: Due to the number of observations, I concluded Flores Torres was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2210 hours, I placed Flores Torres under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed in the front passenger seat per department policy. The passengers of the vehicle contacted Flores Torres mother to come pick them and his son up. TFC. Riba Tankari remained on scene until his mother arrived. He was transported to the Maryland State Police Golden Ring Barrack for further processing.  Upon arrival at the Barrack, I provided Flores Torres with a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Flores Torres was advised of his DR-15 Advice of Rights. At 2236 hours, Flores Torres agreed to take a breath test.  20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD: I conducted the 20-minute observation period with Flores Torres beginning at 2212 hours. A search revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. Flores Torres was observed from that time until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Sgt. Twardowski of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. Flores Torres had a result of .17 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 2243 hours.  INTOXIMETER RESULT: *****.17 grams of alcohol*****  Flores Torres was given all copies of the pertinent paperwork and released.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.  Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
