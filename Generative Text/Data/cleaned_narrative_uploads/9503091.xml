         <NarrativeText>Driver: Brusio Jr, John Antonio MD License: MD1023420791 DUI #: 23-96-070 Video: Yes, TFC S Shubert, Cpl Lenz, Sgt Sweitzer, WCSO Deputy on scene.  This report is a summary and is notpurported to havecaptured every detail that was recorded on video.  Narrative: On 3/30/2023 at approximately 1441 hours, a citizen that identified herself as Rochelle Davis (2/28/1985, 443-859-2728), called the Berlin Barrack to report a vehicle driving erratically and swerving all over the roadway.  Vehicle in Motion: Davis said there was a silver Dodge pickup truck traveling eastbound on US Route 50 in the area of MD Route 90 that was swerving all over the roadway. She described the vehicle as a big silver Dodge Pickup truck with a black front end. The truck was in the fast lane at one point and all of a sudden swerved in front of Davis. Davis said the truck was drifting between lanes and she was forced to swerve around the truck to avoid a collision. She continued to watch the truck drift slowly back and forth between lanes as she called the Berlin Barrack. She also said the truck was varying speeds and would speed up and slow down.  I, TFC Zaykoski, was positioned in the center median area of US Route 50 in front of the Berlin Barrack. I observed this truck approaching the Berlin Barrack on US Route 50. The truck slowed dramatically within the travel lane of US Route 50 as other cars were forced to slow on the highway. The truck made left turn into the Berlin Barrack in a jerky fashion. The turn seemed to be made from lane two of the highway rather than lane three, the right turn lane.  The truck began to pull into a parking spot at the Barrack but stopped. The truck was reversed and then stopped. The truck then pulled into a spot. The truck was not parked straightly in the spot (and later required it to be straightened up by a Trooper upon leaving it parked there).  The truck had no front tag, and also a large crack across the windshield.  Personal Contact: The driver was identified verbally and his MVA records as John Antonio Brusio Jr. He had opened his drivers door and seemed to be in a confused state. He seemed to be staring into space. His words sounded extremely slurred and incoherent.  He claimed he was pulling to the Berlin Barrack to see if his license was suspended. He then began talking about window tint. It was confusing as to what he was talking about and trying to say. I asked for his license and he said I dont have to give you my license. He also did not want to give me his name. He forgot that he had wanted to see if his license was suspended.  He then was saying that he was heading to an auto parts store and was coming from home in Parsonburg.  Pre-Arrest Screening: As we conversed, his speech was still very slurred and his thought process seemed to be incoherent.  I had him speak with me in front of his vehicle on the barrack front sidewalk. He said he was in rehab recently for being a heroin addict. He denied having any alcohol. He listed a long list of medicines he takes: Zyprexa (Olanzapine) which is an antipsychotic medication, 500mg Keppra, a mood stabilizer, 300mg of Seroquel, which is a mood medication which has a sleeping aid and sedating effect, bus bar which he described as an anti-psychotic. He described it as a fake Xanax bar which shows up as fentanyl in his urine. He took them today.  He had to lean on his car for balance. He said he was in a car accident yesterday. He admitted to having bad eyes.  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN): Unable to complete. I explained the instructions to Brusio Jr. I told him to stand with his hands at his side and to follow my pen with his eyes. I held my pen twelve (12) to fifteen (15) inches from Brusio Jrss eyes, slightly above eye level. Brusio Jr did not display any resting nystagmus. His pupils were equal in size and tracked equally. Brusio Jr displayed:  He was unable to track my pen side to side. His eyes would not move smoothly in any fashion and he would not follow it. I attempted to have him complete this test with and without his glasses. Both attempts were unsucessfull as he could not complete the test as instructed to do. It seemed that he could not comprehend the instructions.  Walk and Turn (WAT): Unable to Complete. I explained the test and directed him to the starting position. I told him he will be taking nine steps in a line in a heel-toe fashion. I demonstrated the procedure. On his last step, to keep his front foot planted and he is to take short choppy steps and turn around to take nine steps back. I told him to keep his hands at his sides and to count out loud what step he is on. He said he did not have any questions.  He broke from the starting position multiple times as he was unable to maintain balance. He started walking the test too soon. He was instructed numerous times of the directions and to return to the starting position. It seemed as if he was not comprehending or was physically unable to do what I was asking due to his level of uncoordinated balance and signs of impairment. He would immediately began to loose balance upon entering the starting position. He took his jacket off and tried again. He was still unable to even maintain balance in the starting position. He told me that he was unable to do the test. He did not complete this test as he would not even maintain balance in the starting position.   One Leg Stand (OLS): Unable to complete. I explained and demonstrated the test. I told him he will be lifting any foot of his choosing and hold it six inches off the ground, the height of a soda can or dollar bill. He is to keep his leg straight and hands at his side. He is to count upward in the fashion of one thousand one, one thousand two upwards until about thirty seconds. He did not have any questions.  He attempted the test but said I give up after only few moments. Within in those few moments he was swaying side ot side, and put his foot down. His foot was only being held a few inches above the ground rather than the 6 inches I instructed.  PBT: 0.00 g EtOH/210 L Breath  Arrest Based on the above facts he was placed under arrest for DUI at 1520 hours for DUI (CDS/drugs/medication). He was walked into the barrack and the DR-15A Advice of Rights audio was played while he followed along with printed copy. He called his lawyer multiple times for advice throughout the process.  Intoximeter: 0.00 g EtOH/210 L Breath  Cpl. Lenz Operator  DRE: Refused. He signed a MSP Advice of Miranda Warning form.  He was released from the Barrack. All events occurred in Worcester County, MD. Case closed.</NarrativeText>
