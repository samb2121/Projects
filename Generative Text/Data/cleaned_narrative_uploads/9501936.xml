         <NarrativeText>This interaction and arrest was audibly and visually recorded. My marked patrol vehicle, P-7, is fitted with recording equipment. My body worn camera was activated and operating correctly.    On Friday, October 13th, 2023 at approximately 2330 hours, I responded to a single vehicle accident involving a passenger vehicle in a ditch. I arrived to westbound MD 100 at MD 295 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland and observed a white Honda passenger vehicle in a ditch on the right side of MD 100. Anne Arundel County EMS was waving me over as I witnessed a male, later identified as Asa Shariff Lavon Wright B/M DOB 8/1/95, holding the arm of a female walking toward another vehicle not involved in the accident further west on MD 100. The female was later identified as Mariah Robinson B/F DOB 10/30/96. Through further investigation, it was found Robinson was the driver and sole occupant involved in the single vehicle accident and was the fianc of Wright.Wright was screaming at Robinson stating go sit in the car, fuck that car extremely loudly as Robinson was pacing and crying.Wright was extremely agitated and still screaming.Wright walked toward the wrecked vehicle as I was walking up. I askedWright what was going on.Wright walked past me and stated dont worry about it. Robinson continued walking toWrights vehicle. I continued walking with Robinson along with EMS to further investigate the accident and to see if she was injured. Robinson was still crying and hysterical. Wright then quickly walked up behind myself and EMS as I asked him again what was going on. Wright took an aggressive stance toward me and screamed at me dont ask shit.Wright kept screaming at me and Robinson, telling her to get in his car. In an attempt to de-escalate the situation, I kept my distance fromWright and continued to try to talk to Robinson to further investigate the accident. I attempted to explain calmly toWright that he cannot leave with Robinson to which he took another aggressive stance and screamed at me yes the fuck I can, I can do whatever I want and get away from my car. Robinson was now sitting in the front passenger seat ofWrights car asWright kept pacing back and further from the vehicle involved in the accident and his vehicle. I was attempting to speak to Robinson and make sure she was ok, but she was still crying hysterically and facetiming with her mother instead of speaking to myself or EMS. As EMS and I were attempting to talk to Robinson,Wright re-approached us and continued screaming at us to get the fuck away from my car, move. I explained toWright we are investigating the accident.Wright continued screaming and telling Robinson to stop talking to me and for me to stop talking to her. Robinson eventually did exit the vehicle and began walking back to speak to EMS. At that time, still irate,Wright got in his vehicle and drove away from the scene. S/Tpr Smith #6317 arrived on scene to assist investigating the accident. Myself, EMS, and S/Tpr Smith were finally able to speak to Robinson about the accident and her condition. Within a few minutes,Wright returns to the scene as I see him aggressively walk past EMS and myself toward Robinson who is speaking with paramedics. I addressWright and advise him to stay back to which he replies Im checking on my wife, get the fuck out my face as he continues walking up to Robinson past me, directly disobeying a lawful order.Wright bends down and interrupts the interaction between Robinson and the paramedics. I attempt to getWrights attention several times to ask him to let her talk to EMS. I adviseWright to just back up for a minute so Robinson can speak to paramedics and so we can continue our accident investigation.Wright ignored us and turned back to Robinson. At this time, I placedWright under arrest without further incidents. I readWright his advice of Miranda Rights, to which he invoked.Wrights vehicle was towed from the scene. A loaded Glock 21 was in plain view on the front passenger seat ofWrights vehicle. I secured the firearm in my patrol vehicle.  I transportedWright to the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for further processing. I contacted the Maryland State Police Gun Center. The firearm was found to be registered toWright.Wright possessed a valid wear and carry permit. I was advised by the gun center to release the firearm toWrights family member from the barrack. Frankie Simms,Wrights family member, responded to the barrack to retrieve the firearm. I transportedWright to the Anne Arundel County Central Holding and Processing Center.Wright was provided with copies of charging documents and tow information.Wright was released to CHPC staff.    All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
