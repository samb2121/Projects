         <NarrativeText>MSP marked vehicle F-26 is equipped with a mobile recording device and body worn camera. Defendant: James M. Smyth Date of Birth: 07/03/1975 Date of Arrest: 08/23/2023 Time of Arrest: 1531 hours DUI #: 23-120  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)  On 08/23/2023 at approximately 1531 hours, I, Trooper Jones #7445 of the Maryland State Police - North East Barrack was on duty and dispatched to Cayots Corner Rd and Augustine Herman Highway in reference to a vehicle that had driven off the road. It is noted that Detective Wilson #4771 with the Maryland State Police - Criminal Enforcement Division was behind the vehicle at the time of the vehicle running off the roadway. Det. Wilson advised the police communications officer (PCO) that after making contact with the driver, he administered two doses of Narcan due to the male being unresponsive and foaming from his mouth while in the drivers seat of the vehicle. Upon my arrival at 1547 hours, Det. Wilson also advised after he gave the male driver the Narcan, he immediately responded to it and became somewhat alert. Det. Wilson also requested paramedics respond to the scene who was on scene and evaluating the male driver prior to my arrival.  Personal Contact (Phase 2)  Upon my arrival at 1547 hours, I observed a silver, 2005 Dodge Van bearing Delaware registration PC374723 off the roadway to the right in a ditch. I then spoke with Det. Wilson who advised after he gave the male driver the Narcan, he immediately responded to it and became alert which I knew to be through my Training Knowledge and Experience I received at the Cecil County Sheriffs Office, North East Police Department, and the Maryland State Police due to the presence of a controlled dangerous substance in his body. Det. Wilson also requested paramedics respond to the scene who were on-scene and evaluating the male driver prior to my arrival. I then walked over to the car and observed there to be a full bottle of vodka lying on the front drivers seat of the vehicle. At that time, I then responded to the Ambulance 291 with the Chesapeake City Volunteer Fire Department where the male driver was located. Once I made contact with the male, I was able to identify him through his Delaware Drivers License as James M. Smyth (W/M, DOB: 07/03/1975). During the time I observed Smyth in the back of the ambulance, I was able to detect a strong odor of alcoholic beverages emanating from within the ambulance where Smyth was located. I also observed Smyths eyes to be bloodshot and glassy as well as his pupils to be small and constricted. Along with the brief observations I made upon opening the door to the ambulance, I also observed Smyth to appear not completely aware of what was going on or his surroundings. At one point, I observed Smyth attempting to sit up on the stretch like he was possibly trying to leave. The paramedic in the ambulance with him had to tell Smyth to calm down and that he was in an ambulance to get help. I then deactivated my body worn camera due to medical attention being given to Smyth. A few minutes later, I responded back to the ambulance with a DR-15 Advice of Rights to read to Smyth. Due to Smyth being in the back of the ambulance and EMS personnel advising he was going to be transported to Union Hospital, I was unable to perform any Standardized Field Sobriety Test on Smyth. I then informed Smyth that I was going to be reading him the form and that it was ultimately asking if he would consent have a blood kit completed once he arrived at the hospital.  Once I informed Smyth what the blood kit would be testing for in his body, he admitted to consuming alcohol earlier in the day around noon. Smyth then advised he only had one or two drinks which led me to my next question in asking what type of drinks did he consume. Smyth replied he had both beer and shots. After reading the DR-15, I asked Smyth if he would agree or refuse to a blood kit being done once he arrived at the hospital. Smyth replied again that he had alcohol in his body and ultimately signed the DR-15 indicating he was refusing to submit to a blood kit.  Arrest:  Based on my training, knowledge, and experience listed above, the drivers eyes being bloodshot, glassy, and watery, the driver having a positive reaction to the 2 doses of narcan that was administered after he drove off the road, the odor of alcoholic beverages emanating off his person within the ambulance, and the admittance of consuming both beer and shots of liquor earlier in the day, I believe Smyth was driving under the influence of alcohol and an unknown controlled dangerous substance. At approximately 1613 hours, I then informed Smyth I would be following the ambulance to the hospital where I would be completing paperwork and providing him with his copies as well as issuing him citations for driving under the influence.  All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.  Case Status: Closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>
