         <NarrativeText>  On 6-24-2023 at 1037 hours, I responded to 750 Beall School Road, Frostburg, Maryland 21532 for a death investigation. Upon arrival, I met with Paramedic, Alex Looker, from the Allegany County Rescue Squad. Looker said they arrived on the scene around 1034 hours. Looker said they found the deceased, later identified as Gene Lloyd Cutter Sr: DOB (11-6-1942), laying on his back, head facing west, feet facing east in the bathroom area of the residence. Looker said Cutter was cold to the touch and no rigor mortis was present. Looker said no life-saving treatment was performed. Looker pronounced Cutter deceased at 1035 hours.    I then spoke with Sally Cutter (ex-wife), and Bonnie Cutter (sister-in-law), at that time. According to Sally and Bonnie, they went to Genes house around 1000 hours to feed his cats and check on him. Bonnie and Sally said Gene was sitting on the couch when they arrived. Bonnie and Sally said Gene attempted to stand up from a sitting position on the couch. Bonnie and Sally said Gene then fell to the right, striking his head on a wooden end table sitting next to the couch. Bonnie and Sally said they called another family member who lives a few houses away, Cheryl Lancaster, because she is the only one that would be able to lift Gene off the floor. Bonnie and Sally said they told Gene to stay put and that Cheryl was on her way to help him get up. Bonnie and Sally said Gene did not listen and attempted to get up off the floor. Bonnie and Sally said Gene got up to his knees using the door frame/jamb leading into the bathroom. Bonnie and Sally said Gene then fell face first striking his head again on an unknown object in the bathroom. Sally said she then called 911 at 1022 hours. Bonnie rolled Gene on his back to attempt CPR as instructed by 911. Bonnie said as she did, Gene took a gasp of air and died. Bonnie said no CPR was performed. Bonnie said Gene was at UPMC Urgent Care in Frostburg Maryland yesterday for an infection. While there, Gene was advised by the staff to go to the Hospital because they were concerned with his heart rate. Gene refused to go to the Hospital and instead returned home.    While speaking with Sally and Bonnie, Sally kept on asking about a safe/box in the house that was Genes. Sally mentioned this safe very frequently to myself and fire personnel while speaking with her on the scene.    I spoke with Thomas Friend, who was Genes nephew. Friend said Gene has been in terrible health since about January. Friend said Gene refused to have heart surgery that was recommended by his doctors and was struggling with a hernia and shingles. Friend said prior to January, Gene had never been to the doctors. Friend said that Gene was still very close with his ex-wife, Sally, even thought they had been divorced for 40 years and did not live together. Friend said Gene, until he got sick in January, would transport Sally to the market and to her doctors appointments regularly. I told Friend that Sally kept asking about a lock box that Gene had, and asked him if he knew what was in it. Friend said that Gene had saved money and that he thought there was somewhere between 8 thousand to 15 thousand dollars in cash saved up, that was inside.   It should be noted, 911 was called at 1022 hours and the call came out as a cardiac arrest. Assistant Chief of Eastern Garret Fire Department, Marsh Smith, was first on scene minutes after the 911 call was received. Smith noted the body to be cold and not in condition for any life-saving treatment. Allegany County Ambulance 513 arrived on scene at 1035 hours and noted the body to be cold, but not in rigor mortis and not able to perform any life-saving measures. Based on experience from handling Death investigations in the past, this was suspicious to me. I contacted MSP CED, Cpl Couter. I explained to him over the phone my concerns. We did a face time and examined the body together. Photographs of the deceased and the room were taken and downloaded into veri-pic. The body was cold and no rigor mortis present. Due to the findings, CED did not respond to the scene.    Forensic investigator, Tina Skiles, was contacted and responded to the scene. After her on scene evaluation of the body, Cutter was sent to the OCME Baltimore for an autopsy. Newmanns Funeral Home was contacted and transported the body to the OCME Baltimore at 1330 hours. An MSP 89 B was completed and emailed to OCME and Homicide. States Attorney, Christian Mash, was contacted and advised of the findings.    All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.    Case closed, non criminal.</NarrativeText>
