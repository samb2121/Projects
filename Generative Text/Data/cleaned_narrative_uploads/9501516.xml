         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Narrative:   On 10/13/23 the Allegany Co. Warrant Task Force received information that the suspect, Amanda Luckett was staying at the Best Western Hotel, National Hwy., LaVale MD.. Contact was made with the hotel staff and it was verified she was staying in Room 122 at that location. We did respond to that location and made contact with suspect, Luckett in Room 122. Suspect, Luckett was then taken into custody without incident on Arrest Warrant # D230117904.   At approx. 1101 hrs I advised suspect, Luckett of her Miranda Rights. She did agree to answer questions at that time. During the questioning she did admit to stealing the handgun. She advised that she did not have the handgun and had given it to a Michael Logsdon. She stated that she did try to get the handgun back to return it, but that Logsdon would not give it back to her. She did advise that she was willing to cooperate with the investigation and that she did have text on her phone between her and Logsdon reference the handgun.   I then transported suspect, Luckett to MSP Bk C. I contacted Sgt. Willetts, C3I, to ascertain if an investigator would be willing to interview suspect, Luckett. Cpl. Couter did respond to the barrack and conducted and interview with her to gain more information. At the conclusion of the interview I did transport suspect, Luckett to ACDC Central Booking.   The incident was captured on my Body Worn Camera.   Case remains under investigation by ST. Fairbanks.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>ACTION TAKEN:    On 10/13/2023 I was requested by the Maryland State Police Cumberland Barrack to assist with an interview of a subject they had in custody. I was advised Amanda Luckett was arrested on an active arrest warrant for theft. I was advised that Luckett wished to provide information related to the theft. Upon arrival to the Cumberland Barrack, Luckett was escorted from the holding cell to the Barracks interview room.    This interview was recorded on my agency issued body camera. The following information was obtained during the interview with Luckett; however, it is not a word for word transcription. Please refer to the recording for complete details. The recorded interview, which lasted fifty-five (55) minutes and thirty-one (31) seconds, is retained in the case file. I advised her the interview would be audibly and visually recorded and she agreed.    Luckett was advised of her Miranda rights, using an MSP form 180 (advice of rights), and agreed to speak with me.    I advised Luckett to explain to me what she wished to speak with me about.    Luckett explained that she was staying at the victims, James Butlers residence, due to her having no other place to stay that night. Luckett advised Butler left for work the next morning and she began texting with Michael Logsdon about a firearm and other property that was in Butlers residence. Luckett stated that while texting with Logsdon, she described the firearm to him, and he stated he wanted the firearm. Luckett advised that Logsdon stated he would be able to compensate her for the firearm. Luckett told me she took the firearm and left Butlers residence. Luckett explained that she did not have a way to get to Logsdons residence, so she went to Frostburg and was still attempting to arrange a ride with Logsdon. Luckett stated she spent the rest of the day attempting to arrange a ride to Logsdons residence on Devore Street in Ellerslie, Maryland.    Luckett told me that at around 2000 hours, she was picked up from the 7-11 in Frostburg and was taken to Logsdons residence on Devore Street. Luckett advised that Logsdon and his neighbor provided the ride from Frostburg to Ellerslie. Luckett advised once they arrived at Logsdons residence, she gave the gun to him. Luckett told me she stayed with Logsdon and his girlfriend that night and the next day she was able to get a ride to the Best Western, where she and her boyfriend were staying in a room. Luckett was arrested at the Best Western by Master Trooper Layton.    Luckett explained that Butler called her mother the next day and told her that she stole items from his residence. Luckett advised she messaged Butler and told him she was sorry for what she did. Luckett stated that Butler told her if she brought him his belongings back that evening, he wouldnt press charges. Luckett advised she didnt have a ride to go to Butlers place that day. Luckett stated her mother contacted her and told her the police were looking for her and that she needed to return Butlers belongings. Luckett explained that she messaged Logsdon and asked him to give her the firearm back. Luckett advised that Logsdon acted as if he did not know what she was talking about. Luckett stated she tried to reason with him, saying that she was already in enough trouble, and that he asked her to get the firearm for him. Luckett told me that Logsdon did not message her back until the next day and told her that he did not have his phone with him. Luckett advised that Logsdon told her that the cops were at his house looking for her. Luckett explained that she continued to reason with Logsdon, and he eventually became upset with her, and told her that they were currently hiding in their house because the cops were looking for her. Luckett stated that Logsdon told her to come get the fucking thing.    Luckett, at this point of the conversation, told me that this occurred at Logsdons girlfriend, Jessica Carrs residence. Luckett advised they lived on Devore Street, Ellerslie, Maryland. Luckett stated that Logsdons mother lives in Hyndman, Pennsylvania. I then went over the property that was reported stolen from Butlers residence. Luckett admitted to taking the reported items and stated they were in a bag. Luckett advised that she left the bag at Carrs and Logsdons residence the morning she left. Luckett added that Logsdon told her that the day the cops came to his residence, he removed all the stolen property from the residence.    Luckett and I spoke about if there were narcotics in the residence. Luckett stated that Carr and Logsdon both use Meth.    At approximately [20:31] into to recording, I recapped the story that Luckett told me, for clarification. While recapping the story, Luckett goes into detail about where the stolen items were when she found them. Luckett found the items in Butlers closet and they were in a bag. Luckett states she called a cab and went to Frostburg, where shes walking around trying to get a ride from Logsdon. Luckett says that eventually Logsdon and his neighbor, Adam Sturtz, came and picked her up from 7-11 and drove her to Logsdons residence. Luckett explains that once they arrive at Logsdons residence, he takes the firearm out of her bag and starts to play with the laser sight. Luckett tells me thats the last time she saw the firearm. I then asked Luckett what she received in return for the firearm. Luckett told me she received nothing from Logsdon for the firearm. Luckett advised she was supposed to receive money in exchange for the firearm, due to Logsdon being able to sell the firearm. Luckett explained that she left the draw stringed Under Armor backpack that contained the rest of the stolen items at Logsdons residence. Luckett stated she left the backpack in the middle bedroom of the residence. Luckett advised she then left the next morning to go meet up with her boyfriend, leaving the backpack containing the stolen items.  Luckett and I then spoke about the messages she has on her cellular device between her and Logsdon. I then presented Luckett with an MSP form 78 (Consent to Search and Seize). I then read her the form and she consented to let me read and capture digital photographs of the conversations. These digital photographs were uploaded to the case file on Google Drive for further review.  The interview was then ended.  Due to the information about the location of the firearm, and Luckett being uncertain if the firearm was still at Logsdons residence or his mothers residence in Pennsylvania, no further action was taken at this time.  Since Luckett has already been charged with the theft, this concludes my involvement with this case.  Case remains open, pending S/T Fairbanks review.</NarrativeText>
