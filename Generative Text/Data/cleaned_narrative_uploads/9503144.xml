         <NarrativeText>  On 3/26/2023 myself and ST Spicer responded to 11603 Carl Ave Cumberland MD in reference to a juvenile that had been placed there by Allegany County Social Services attempting to leave the residence. The caller, Sharon Dolly reported that Angelin Werner wont listen to any of her requests and no longer wants her as a foster child in the residence.    While en-route to the residence we observed Werner walking on Kriegbaum Rd toward Ellerslie, MD. We contacted Werner who remained cooperative during our contact. Social Services was contacted on scene and advised they would need time to locate another foster family for Werner to be placed. Werner was transported to the MSP Cumberland Barracks. At approximately 1815 hrs, Allegany County Social Services Natalie Long responded to the barrack and picked up Werner. She was taken by Long to Hannah Colemans residence, a foster family, at 11206 Poorbaugh Ave, Corriganville, MD. I reminded her that this house was in even more close proximity to Werners boyfriends house and that she would likely run away from there as well. She advised there were no other options for Werner at this time.    It should be noted that MSP Cumberland Barracks has responded to multiple calls for service regarding Angelin Werner this week. Each time she has left without permission, and was quickly located. Each were coded as Attempt to Locate and closed on the card. Those instances are as follows:    On 3/23/23 at approximately 2047 hrs, Kathleen Roberts, a foster parent, contacted the MSP Cumberland Barracks and advised Angelin Werner had run away from her residence at 16004 Foundry Row, Mt Savage, MD. Roberts advised Werner was placed with her by Allegany County Social Services the day prior. Werner only stayed with her one night, then left the residence. At 2109 hrs Sharon Dolly contacted the barrack and advised Werner was at her residence at 11603 Carl Ave, Corriganville, MD. Contact was made with Werner at that residence where she remained cooperative. Allegany County Social Services representative Karen Stansberry was contacted and advised of the situation.Stansberry contacted Sharon Dolly by telephone, then called the barrack back advising Werner could stay at the Carl Ave address with Dolly. Troopers cleared the scene.    On 3/24/23 at approximately 1458 hrs. Social Services contacted the MSP Cumberland Barracks and advised that Angelin Werner had got on the school bus from Mt Ridge High School with her boyfriend Trent Harris. Harris lives at 14202 Stevenson St, Ellerslie, MD with his mother, Amanda Whitacre. Troopers responded to Stevenson St and located Angelin Werner. Werner remained cooperative during their contact. Social Services was contacted. Christie Pratt of ACSS advised to return Werner back to the Carl Ave address. Troopers returned her and cleared the scene.    On 3/25/23 at approximately 2230 hrs, Sharon Dolly contacted the MSP Cumberland Barracks and advised she was awakened by the sound of vehicles outside. She advised she looked out the window and observed a taxi outside that was picking up Angelin Werner. I contacted Queen City Taxi who advised they did have a call for service at that location. Cpl. Shoenadel located the vehicle at the Frostburg Depot Train Station. During a traffic stop, Angelin Werner remained cooperative. Social Services was contacted and advised to return Werner back to the Carl Ave Address. Troopers returned her and cleared.  End of previous calls for service involving Angelin Werner.  During each conversation with Allegany County Social Services I advised them this would continue until Werner was placed in a facility. Each time they advised there wasnt one available, and there were no other foster families willing to take her at this time.  I request this case be closed. No charges were filed.    </NarrativeText>
