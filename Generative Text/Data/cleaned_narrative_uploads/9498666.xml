         <NarrativeText>23-MSP-026820  Incident: Cleared Missing Person Report  Date/ Time: 07/28/2023, 2236 hours  Location of the Missing Person Report:  4108 KINSWAY, BALTIMORE, MD 21206  Location of Contact with Missing Subject:  MSP WESTMINSTER BARRACK 1100 BALTIMORE BLVD WESTMINSTER, MD 21157  Attachments:  -copy of NCIC confirmation -copy of MVA info for the Missing Subject and her boyfriend -copy of MSP Form 79A  My investigation was captured on AXON digital body camera assigned to me.  Training  Qualifications:  -MSP Academy, June 25, 2007 to December 21, 2007  C.I.T.: Crisis Intervention Team (Carroll County), (Carroll County Public Safety Training Center, 11/05-11/09/2018)  -C.I.T.: Crisis Intervention Team (Carroll County) , (Carroll County Public Safety Training Center 04/22/2022) Understanding Domestic Violence Among Adults  Adolescents: One Love: Understanding  Identifying the Signs of Healthy and Unhealthy Relationships  Missing Subject:  KENYA ASHA CLARK 1/F, DOB 12/12/2001  Subjects Boyfriend:  JOHN LAWRENCE PENSMITH, 2nd 2/M, DOB 01/31/1993  Scene Processing:  Clark and Pensmith were interviewed separately.  Neighborhood Check:  None conducted due to the nature of the incident.  Narrative:  On 07/28/2023 at approximately 2236 hours, I was on duty, in uniform, at the MSP Westminster Barrack (1100 Baltimore Blvd, Westminster, Carroll County, MD 21157), at the Duty Officer station. Two subjects came into the MSP Westminster Barrack lobby, who were subsequently positively identified by MVA photo comparison to be KENYA ASHA CLARK and JOHN LAWRENCE PENSMITH, 2nd. Clark advised she had been contacted by a friend of hers and was advised that she was reported to Baltimore (City) PD as a Missing Person. Clarks identity was confirmed by MVA photo comparison, and her status as a reported missing person was confirmed by MSP Westminster Dispatch. I made contact with her and interviewed her in the MSP Westminster Barrack conference room.  Clark advised she is 21 years old, and had been residing with her parents at 4108 Kinsway, Baltimore, MD 21157. Clark stated her parents were away on a vacation for their anniversary. Prior to their return, and approximately 2 day before being reported as missing (reported on 07/27/2023), Clark left the residence and moved in with her boyfriend at his residence of 2200 Ridge Rd, Westminster, Carroll County, MD. Clark advised they have been dating for approximately 2.5 years, since shortly after she turned 18. Clark stated she sent a text to her mother and advised her that she was leaving the family residence, and says she has been in contact with her mother by text and email (no phone calls or face to face communication). Clark stated the reason for leaving the residence was she is and adult, and no longer wanted to be living with her parents. Clark was calm, very articulate, and advised she has a good relationship with her mother. Clark advised she was not being controlled by her boyfriend and was not being held against her will or threatened in any way.  When I asked Clark about her relationship with her father, specifically if he was abusive in any way, Clark stated she would decline to answer that question at this time. Clark clearly became visible uncomfortable and desired to move on from that question. Clark made it very clear she did not want to talk about or talk to her father.  Cpl McCarty spoke with Pensmith. I was advised that Pensmith stated he and Clark have been in a relationship for over 2 years, and she broached the subject to him about her moving in. Cpl McCarty advise he did not have any observations of an abusing or controlling relationship between Pensmith and Clark.  I completed the MSP Form 79A with Clark. Contact was made with BPD, and they were advised Clark was located and ok, no in need of medical or police assistance. BPD removed Clark from the NCIC MPR database.  Case closed at this time.  My contact and investigation occurred in Carroll County, MD. </NarrativeText>
