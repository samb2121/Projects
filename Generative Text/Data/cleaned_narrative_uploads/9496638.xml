         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>I have been requested to investigate this allegation of physical child abuse in Garrett County, Maryland.  The case originated in Allegany County, MD through a school resource officer. SRO Beck met with the alleged 13 yr old victim at Washington Middle School on March 2, 2023. During the interview of Miliana Hamilton, she stated her mother was the girlfriend of Robert Lee Dozier and they were living with him in Garrett County, Maryland.  At some point between September and December 2022, Dozier physically assaulted Miliana by choke slamming her to the ground. Hamilton also alleged Dozier sexually assaulting her in Baltimore in June 2022. This incident was investigated by Child Protective Services, however, Hamilton retracted her statements and claimed she made it all up. These allegations have been brought against Dozier once again since he is now incarcerated in the Garrett County Jail and Hamilton feels safe to speak about it.  I have received the incident report from C3I in Allegany County and it has been attached to this report.  I contacted the Garrett County Child Advocacy Center and discovered a forensic interview had already been completed concerning these allegations. I requested a copy be sent so I could observe the interview.  On 3/28/2023, I received a copy of the interview which took place on 3/14/2023. I observed the interview and at one point near the end, I heard Miliana speaking of the allegations which occurred in Baltimore, Maryland. I heard her mention some evidence may be located on Rob Doziers cell phone which was an I-Phone contained in a black casing.  Knowing that Rob Dozier was incarcerated in the Garrett County Detention Center, I contacted Capt. R. Zimmerman of the Garrett County Sheriffs Department to inquire if Doziers phone was seized. During our discussion, Capt. Zimmerman knew all about the allegations Miliana was alleging because one of his investigators already investigated those allegations. It was these allegations which led to a search and seizure warrant on Doziers residence in January 2023. I was also advised, police in Baltimore are aware of the allegations and have their own investigation being conducted on what allegedly occurred in their jurisdiction. Just to be sure we were speaking of the same allegations, I reiterated what I was looking into. Capt. Zimmerman confirmed what I was investigating and stated the Garrett County CAC also did a forensic interview in January 2023 on these same allegations.  Due to this investigation already investigated by the Garrett County Sheriffs Department and that agency following up with the proper authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, this will conclude my involvement in this investigation. This case will be considered closed.  Miliana was attending Northern Middle School in Garrett County, Maryland at the time Robert Dozier was arrested. Her allegations against Dozier were revealed to a school counselor in Garrett County at that time which prompted the investigation by the Garrett County Sheriffs Office. When Miliana started attending Washington Middle School in Allegany County, she advised of the same allegations to her new school counselor which were already investigated.  Last week, Robert Dozier accepted a plea agreement in Garrett County on his previous charges and received three (3) years of incarceration.  Case Closed. </NarrativeText>
