         <NarrativeText>CASE #: 23-MSP-005206  SUSPECT: UNKNOWN  VICTIM: Anthony Shane Waldren (MD W-436-067-756-534)  Starvin Artists LLC, 1300 Mercantile Ln Suite 100-0, Largo MD, 20774  *This incident was recorded on my body worn camera system*  NARRATIVE:   On February 10, 2023 at approximately 1025 hours, I, Trooper Keller #7360 responded to the MSP Glen Burnie barrack to meet with a complainant regarding a possible identity theft and fraud. The complainant, identified as Anthony Shane Waldren (B/M DOB 07/05/1981), stated that he had received a letter in the mail from the Small Business Association (SBA) regarding a COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (COVID-19 EIDL). Waldren stated that he is the sole owner of the graphic design business Starvin Artist LLC in which the letter lists as the addressee, but had never applied for a loan through the SBA or any other loan agency around the time the loan was applied for.  Waldren provided me with the letter which was time marked January 22, 2023. Waldren stated that he received the letter approximately a week ago. The letter, a payment notice from the SBA advising that Waldren is to start repaying the loan in February of 2023, lists loan #4188848201. There is also a contact number listed which Waldren stated he had called a couple days after receiving the letter to attempt to gather further information. Waldren stated that SBA representative Shana #4860 advised the original load amount was for $14,000 and was applied for August 6, 2020. After explaining to the representative that he suspects an identity theft and fraud has occurred, she provided him with a Declaration of Identity Theft form and advised him to contact law enforcement to obtain a report. Waldren stated that he believes the application process for the COVID-19 EIDL can be completed entirely online and that for an individual to apply for the loan they would had used basic and sensitive information about him including his social security number, DOB, etc., as well as information regarding his business. Waldren added that other than receiving the letter from the SBA he has not observed any other red flags, unusual banking transactions, or other indicators of further breach of identity information.  Waldren stated that he is unaware of anyone with access or knowledge of his personal or business information needed to apply for the loan. He confirmed with me that he had never applied for this loan or any other in that time period and is unaware of where the $14,000 loan went to. Waldren completed an MSP 89A Uniform Identity Fraud/ Theft Reporting Form and was provided a copy of the form for his records. Walden was also provided with the Identity Theft brochure through the Maryland Attorney Generals Office as well as a checklist for recommended actions to further protect his personal and business sensitive information.  Following our conversation, I contacted the SBA to attempt to receive further information regarding loan #4188848201. After explaining the incident to the representative, she advised that she is unable to provide loan information but once the declaration and a police report are completed, Walden is to email the documents along with a PDF of his photo ID to the SBA. Once the documents are received, the SBA Identity Theft Investigations Unit will conduct a full investigation into the incident. She advised that during the investigation the SBA will put a hold on the loan payments.  I request this case be forwarded to the SBA Identity Theft Investigations Unit for further investigation.  All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
