         <NarrativeText>  On 7/28/2023, I responded to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack for the report of a fraud. I made contact with the complainant, identified as Judith Schrey Grace (DOB: 1/11/1944) by her Maryland drivers license. Grace advised that she had lost $1,000 to scammers. Grace advised she started speaking with the scammers on 7/19/2023 in hopes of getting free money that was promised in a rumor she heard. All interactions with the scammer were through Facebook Messenger with the account of Michael Arnold Clinton. The scammer claimed to be an attorney and promised $200,000 in return for a $4,500 investment. Grace tried to pay the investment but told the scammer she did not have enough money for the investment. The scammer told Grace it would not work without her investment and ended the conversation. On 7/23/2023, Grace reached out to the scammer again trying to see if she could still get the $200,000. The scammer advised Grace that he still needed an investment. Grace again advised she didnt have any money for it. The scammer lowered the price for Grace to $1,000. The scammer tried to get the money through CashApp, but Grace did not have it. The scammer had Grace instead go buy two $500 Apple gift cards at two separate stores. Grace complied. The scammer had Grace send a picture of the gift card codes to them. Over the next few days the scammer lied to Grace, stating that her $200,000 was on its way to her house in a Fed-Ex truck from California. The scammer at one point sent a video of a Fed-Ex truck driving on the highway, but the audio of the video was the person driving station they were calling the police because the truck was driving reckless and swerving all over the road. On 7/26/2023, the scammer contacts Grace stating that the Fed-Ex truck was stopped by an IRS checkpoint. The scammer said the IRS was seizing the cash until Grace could pay a 10% tax on the cash. Grace stated she could not pay the tax and the scammer continued to harass her about paying for the tax for multiple days. At one point the scammer stated they were the IRS and confirmed that Grace needed to pay the tax to get her cash. The scammer also created a fake IRS document to send to Grace. At that point Grace had contacted her son, who was a financial assistant, and he told her to stop contacting the scammer. On 7/27/2023, Grace again reached out to another scammer on Facebook Messenger to attempt to get a similar deal. This scammers profile was Regina Tyler. The scammer went through a similar process and asked for gift cards again. This time Graces son was able to stop her before she provided another scammer more money. I advised Grace to stop contacting people promising free money as it usually turns out to be a scam. Grace was provided the case number for the incident. All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland. I request this case closed due to no further leads.</NarrativeText>
