         <NarrativeText>On 12/20/23 I, Cpl. Cearfoss #6041, was sitting stationary on the left shoulder in an unmarked silver Maryland State Police patrol vehicle on westbound MD 100 just prior to I-97. I was in an active construction zone with my emergency light activated. I was sitting past an arrow board directing traffic to move right. There were orange traffic barrels to my right. At approximately 2138 hours, a bronze Buick Encore bearing DE registration PC 126861 struck two of the orange barrels just in front of my patrol vehicle and kept going. I pulled out into traffic, caught up with the vehicle and conducted a traffic stop on that vehicle. I made contact with the driver who was identified by her DE drivers license as Jada Reign Brumble B/F DOB 8/16/99. I identified myself and the reason for the stop. The traffic stop resulted in the issuance of a citation and I cleared the stop after. At approximately 1015 hours, I made contact with the project manager for the overtime assignment I was currently on. He advised the Buick was still up ahead, at the location I stopped her at, and wanted me to see if she could move because it wasnt a safe location. I went back and made contact with her again. While speaking with Brumble, she advised a friend was coming to pick her up. Brumble appearing to be struggling with something mentally and referenced a past abuse she was going through. I provided her with several options, to include filing charged with the commissioner, filing a protective order and/or calling 911 if it were to happen again. I had Brumble move her vehicle to a safer location to wait for her friend. I followed her to the LA Fitness parking lot on Quarterfield Rd and spoke with her more since she was visibly upset. She referenced being tired and alluded to possibly striking the barrels on purpose, but was being vague with her answers and statements. I asked Brumble if she would like to speak with someone, or have mobile crisis respond out. She was hesitant and eventually agreed to. Her friend showed up on scene shortly after and no longer wanted to talk with mobile crisis. I provided her with the phone number and told her to call that number or 911 any time if she needed help, or to talk. Brumble remained with her friend and I returned to my SHA assignment. </NarrativeText>
