         <NarrativeText>T-35 In-Car Camera Not Operational. BWC Utilized.  Narrative:  On 12/8/2023, at approximately 1300 hours, I, Trooper Holder #7505, was traveling to my duty assignment located in St. Marys County, MD. I was traveling westbound approaching the Gov. William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge. As I got on the bridge, traffic was steadily flowing. As I got closer to the top of the bridge, traffic began to come to a stop. I eventually approached a vehicle in lane two of the bridge that was stationary. The vehicle was a gray GMC Terrain bearing Delaware registration of PC249809. As I approached the vehicle, I observed a white female attempting to climb over the edge of the railing on the side of the bridge. The female had her right leg mounted on the railing below the top railing. The females arms and hands were gripping the top railing while her upper body was hunched over the side of the railing. The white female would later be identified as Holly Marie Lindquist (10/01/1959). Another white female, later identified as Danielle Nicole Moore (DOB: 08/20/1983), had approached Lindquist and wrapped her hands around Lindquists waist to keep her from jumping off the bridge. I turned on the rear emergency lights in my patrol vehicle, put my car in park, and quickly approached both females.  As I made contact with Moore, she stated Lindquist had terminal cancer, lost her son, her husband told her she should die, and that Lindquist made suicidal statements. I quickly placed my right hand on Lindquists right bicep area and began to try and gain her attention by calling her by her first name. Lindquist was hysterically crying and told me No and refused to let go of the railing and look at me. I used my left hand/arm to reach around the left side of Lindquists waist. I then released Lindquists right bicep and placed my right hand/arm around the right side of Lindquists waist. I then pulled Lindquist from over the edge of the railing to safety in front of her vehicle. I then advised Moore to call 911. I then moved my left and right hand from Lindquists waist area and placed my left and right hand on her left and right shoulder to assure that Lindquist would not try and jump off the bridge again. I asked Lindquist what was going on. Lindquist stated that she just wanted to die. I told Lindquist that im not letting that happen. Lindquist continued to cry hysterically. Moore maintained contact with Lindquist to make sure she didnt try to jump off the bridge again as well. Lindquist stated again that she just wanted to die.  At this time, Officer Burford #0852 from the Maryland Department Transportation Authority Police arrived on scene to assist. Ofc. Burford assured Lindquist that we were there to help. Lindquist the stated No. Let me die as she continued to cry. Lindquist stated that she doesnt want to have to live this shitty life anymore. I held Lindquists hands while Ofc. Burford handcuffed her in the front of her body. Officer Anthony #1162 from the Maryland Department Transportation Authority Police, arrived on scene to further assist. Ofc. Anthony drove his patrol vehicle to my location. Lindquist requested I retrieve her necklace with the image of her son on it from her vehicle. Moore, Ofc. Burford and I escorted Lindquist to Ofc. Anthonys vehicle where she was placed in the front seat of his patrol vehicle. I then went to Lindquists vehicle and located her necklace. Additionally, I retrieved her cellular phone and prescription pill bottle with her name on it to help properly identify her. I gave the pill bottle to Ofc. Anthony and put the necklace and the cellular phone in the vehicle with Lindquist.  I spoke with Moore who stated that she was traveling westbound on the Gov. William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge when she noticed traffic began to slow down. Moore stated that she was the passenger in her vehicle, and they had gotten stuck behind Linquists vehicle and had assumed that her vehicle had broken down. Moore stated as she began to pass Lindquists vehicle, she observed Lindquist trying to jump off of the bridge. Moore stated at that time her vehicle came to a stop, and she got out of her vehicle and rushed over to Lindquist. It was around this time when I arrived on scene.  After speaking with Ofc. Burford, he advised that they received a call from dispatch who advised that Lindquists employer called dispatch as a result of Lindquist calling her employer. Lindquists stated to her employer that she was headed to the Gov. William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge to do harm to herself and end her life. Lindquists employer relayed this information to dispatch.  Ofc. Anthony took custody of Lindquist, she was transported to the Anne Arundel Medical center where she was emergency petitioned with and Extreme Risk Protective Order, and released to the care and custody of the employees at the medical facility.  A copy of Ofc. Anthonys report will later be attached upon completion.  All of the above events occurred in Queen Annes County, MD.  Case Closed.</NarrativeText>
