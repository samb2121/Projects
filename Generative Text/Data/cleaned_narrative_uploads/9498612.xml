         <NarrativeText>Narrative Marked Car L-24: In-Car Camera footage and Body Worn Camera recorded. Assisting Troopers/Officers: Tpr Murray #7580. Body-worn camera recorded  Scene Processing: Verbal recorded statement from witnesses   NARRATIVE:   On 09/01/2023 at approximately 0245 hours, I, Trooper Lebga, #7447, of the Maryland State Police, Forestville Barrack was dispatched to Eastbound MD-214, west of Harry Truman Drive located in Prince Georges County MD, for a subject in the roadway. Upon my arrival, I observed two vehicles side by side in lane number 2 and 3. The on-scene investigation revealed that the two vehicles where motorists who came across the subject laying partially in lane 2 and lane number 3.  Both motorists were identified by their Maryland Drivers Licenses as Nathan Cornelius White Jr (B/M, DOB: 10/03/1969) and Charmon Savage (B/M, DOB: 11/06/1974). White Jr stated that he was traveling on Eastbound MD-214 from I-495 in the far-right lane when he observed a subject in the roadway. White Jr advised at the time, he could not confirm it was a person laying down in the roadway or something else. Because it was too late for him to come to a complete stop, he continued and made a U-turn at Harry Truman drive. He returned to the scene and observed it was a person laying in the roadway and called 911. Savage also advised that he stopped out with White Jr and they both positioned their vehicles in the lane with their emergency lights on to protect the pedestrian from getting hit by oncoming vehicles. While on scene, Ambulance Paramedic 802 arrived and quickly rushed the pedestrian to the Capital regional Shock Trauma hospital due the severity of the injuries. White Jr further advised that he observed a silver Sedan suspected to be an Infiniti Q45 approximately 200 feet east from the pedestrian and a male was walking towards the direction of the pedestrian and when he returned to the scene the male and the vehicle was gone. I canvased the area and I couldnt find the suspected Infiniti Q45 or any other person in the area.  I conducted a follow-up to the hospital and the doctors advised that the pedestrian was in a critical condition. At that time, myself and the hospital staff we were unable to identify the pedestrian because he had no any form of identification on him.  On 09/03/2023, I conducted a follow-up with the hospital. The hospital staff advised that the pedestrian was currently in an intensive care unit (ICU), under critical care, and he was on life support. At this time, the pedestrian was still unidentified.  On 09/13/2023, Sgt. Hooten contacted Capital Regional hospital, and he was advised the pedestrian was transferred to the University of Maryland, Baltimore Shock Trauma Center on 09/11/2023. Capital Regional hospital further advised that the pedestrian may undergo surgery. The pedestrian was still listed being in critical condition and on a breathing life supporting machine.    On 09/03/2023, the family of the pedestrian came to the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack and identified the pedestrian to be Damion Leo Gardner (B/M, DOB: 02/18/1980). The family were identified by their Maryland drivers license as Janine Mary Puller (B/F, DOB: 12/02/1969) and Ronald Vincent Puller (B/M, DOB: 04/18/1957). Janine Puller advised that Gardner was homeless, likes to walk at night, and uses PCP.   At this point, no further information has been obtained.    All above event occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland.   </NarrativeText>
