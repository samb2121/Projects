         <NarrativeText>C-33 is equipped with a mobile recording device Defendant: Garcia Enriquez, Jose Antonio Date of Birth: 04/01/1990 Date of Arrest: 01/09/2024 Times of Arrest: 1414 hours MD Soundex: G-625-440-067-259 DUI # - 24-002 (Cumberland)  TRAINING/CERTIFICATES: * Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. * Trained and certified to operate RADAR and LIDAR through the Maryland State Police.  VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On Tuesday, January 9th, 2024 at approximately 1359 hours I observed a white van to be facing the wrong direction east of exit 68. The van was off the shoulder approximately 4 to 5 feet and stuck in snow. I pulled onto the shoulder and activated my rear emergency lights. I approached the van on the passenger side window and knocked on the window. I observed the vehicle to be running and the person in the drivers seat opened the drivers side door and exited. The driver walked around the front of the vehicle and I made contact.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I contacted the driver and asked if he was ok. When the driver walked around the front of the van, I observed him to have urinated on himself and had his pants unzipped. The driver advised he was ok but he needed a tow truck for the vehicle. While speaking with the driver I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and observed him to have bloodshot eyes. I asked the driver for his drivers license and was able to identify the driver of the vehicle as Jose Antonio Garcia Enriquez. I asked Garcia Enriquez how many alcoholic beverages he had drank prior to driving and he advised that he had 2. I asked how long ago he had drunk them and he advised yesterday. I told Garcia Enriquez that I could smell it on his person and then he told me that he had it earlier in the day. I asked Garcia Enriquez if he would be willing to take voluntary SFSTs and he advised he would.    PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder on westbound I-68 east of exit 68. The surface was wet, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was raining. Lighting conditions consisted of the sun, and my patrol vehicles headlights. My patrol vehicles forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Garcia Enriquez appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.  I asked Garcia Enriquez the following questions: Glasses or Contacts  None Medical Conditions  None Injuries  None Medication  None   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6) The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my index finger was used as the tests stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15, slightly above eye level. Garcia Enriquez was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Garcia Enriquezs pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking. Garcia Enriquez was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. The test was attempted while Garcia Enriquez was sitting in the drivers seat of the vehicle. I attempted to do the test on Garcia Enriquez but due to the positioning in the seat the test wasnt able to be completed. I attempted to get Garcia Enriquez out of the vehicle and complete tests multiple times but he refused. While attempting the test I observed him to have very constricted pupils.  1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes. 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes. 3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes. * Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was not present.  WALK AND TURN (4/8) Prior to Garcia Enriquez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Garcia Enriquez was instructed to place her right foot directly in front of her left foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary line on the sidewalk. Garcia Enriquez was instructed and demonstrated to place her hands flat at her sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Garcia Enriquez was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight-line touching heel to toe on every step. Garcia Enriquez was instructed to keep her hands flat at her sides, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Garcia Enriquez was explained and demonstrated to keep her lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Garcia Enriquez was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Garcia Enriquez was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her sides, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Garcia Enriquez if she understood the test and she stated, Yes. Instructional Stage: 1) Broke from starting position. First Nine: 1) Missed heel to toe more than  inch on steps 5 and 6. Turn: Didnt keep lead foot planted. Second Nine: 1) Missed heel to toe more than  inch on steps 1, 2, 3, and 5. 2) Took 7 steps instead of 9.  ONE LEG STAND (2/4) Prior to Garcia Enriquez performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Garcia Enriquez was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down by her sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off of the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised she was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Garcia Enriquez was asked if she understood the test and the instructions to which she stated, Yes. Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10: 1) Nothing observed Seconds 11-20: 1) Put foot down. 2) Swaying to the left and right. Seconds 21-30: 1) Put foot down. 2) Swaying to the left and right.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Garcia Enriquez was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcoholic beverages: * Admitted to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving. * Sitting in the drivers seat with the vehicle running. * Urinated on himself and pants unzipped. * Strong odor of alcoholic beverage. * Multiple open containers inside of the vehicle. Due to the number of observations, I had reason to believe Garcia Enriquez was driving under theinfluence and was unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 1414 hours,I placed Garcia Enriquez under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol. Apreliminary search of Garcia Enriquez was conducted on the scene and it revealed that hehad nothing in his mouth. After placing Garcia Enriquez in the passenger seat of my patrol vehicle he asked me to shut off his vehicle. I approached his vehicle and observed multiple open beer cans in the center of the vehicle. I shut off the vehicle and placed the keys on the drivers seat. I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights form to Garcia Enriquez at 1501hours. Garcia Enriquez accepted to submit to the intoximeter test.  INTOXIMETERRESULT - *******.19****** Case status: closed by arrest. All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
