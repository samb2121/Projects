         <NarrativeText>L-8 is equipped with a mobile recording device, this incident was recorded. This incident was also recorded with my body-worn camera.  Defendant: Cedar L Argueta Claros  Date of Birth: 01/30/1983  Date of Arrest: 03/12/2023  Time of Arrest: 0612 hours  MD License #: A-623-112-487-080  DUI #: 23-083    TRAINING/CERTIFICATES      Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on December 5th-8th, 2022.      Trained in administering Preliminary Breath Tests through the Maryland State Police Forensics Science Division on December 9, 2022.       Vehicle in Motion (Phase 1): On March 12, 2023 at approximately 0556 hours, I, Trooper Stacey #7390 of the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack was traveling southbound on Interstate 495 north of Maryland Route 4 in Prince Georges County, Maryland. At this time I observed a Silver Toyota RAV4 bearing MD registration 8AJ6058 traveling in lane #4 at an extremely slow rate of speed. At this time I got behind the vehicle and observed it speed up to 64 mph in lane #4. The vehicle was straddling both sides of lane #4, almost sideswiping a white Ford F-150 in lane #3. I immediately activated my emergency equipment prior to the Toyota RAV4 striking the F150. The Toyota RAV4 then pulled over to the right shoulder of the roadway.  Personal Contact (Phase 2): Upon my drivers side approach of the vehicle, I immediately detected a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I identified the driver by his Maryland Drivers License as Cesar L Argueta Claros (O/M 01/30/1983). Argueta Claros eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I asked Argueta Claros how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed prior to driving and he advised one drink. He first advised me that he was coming from work. He later changed his story and advised he was going to work, and coming from home. I then asked Argueta Claros to exit the vehicle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Once Argueta Claros was out of the vehicle, I detected a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3): The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of the highway. The weather was clear and cold, approximately 35 degrees. Lighting conditions were dark. The ground was level and free of any debris. My patrol vehicles overhead emergency lights in the front were deactivated prior to field sobriety tests as well as the vehicles spot light. Argueta Claros was wearing a winter jacket. Argueta Claros was wearing flat heeled shoes. Argueta Claros appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible signs of injuries.  I asked Argueta Claros the following questions: Medical Conditions: None Glasses or contacts: No  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from his eyes. Argueta Claros was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes. Argueta Claros pupils were of equal size and showed equal tracking.  Argueta Claros displayed the following clues:      Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes      Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes      Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes       WALK AND TURN TEST (5/8 clues observed) Prior toArgueta Clarosperforming the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted.Argueta Claros was instructed to place hisright foot directly in front of hisleft foot and touch heel to toe on an imaginary line.Argueta Claroswas instructed and demonstrated to place hishands flat at hissides and to remain in that position until told to begin.Argueta Claroswas advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Argueta Claroswas instructed to keep hishands flat at hersides, keep hiseyes focused on hisfeet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Argueta Claroswas explained and demonstrated to keep hislead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with hisrear foot to the left to turn completely around.Argueta Claroswas again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Argueta Claroswas instructed that once she began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep hishands down by hissides, look down at hisfeet, and count each step out loud.  Instructional Stage:      Cannot keep balance during instruction      Starts too soon     Walking Stage (1st set of nine steps):      Does not touch heel to toe for steps 1,2,3,6, and 9      Improper turn      Improper amount of steps     Walking Stage (2nd set of nine steps):      Does not touch heel to toe for steps 4 and 5       ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)  Prior to Argueta Claros performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. He was instructed to stand with his feettogether and hands down by his side while the instructions were given. During the test he was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start, once the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop.Argueta Claros advised he didnt understand, so I re instructed until he understood.  Argueta Claros displayed the following clues: Raises arms for balance:  0 to 10  11 to 20  21 to 30  Foot down:  0 to 10  11 to 20  21 to 30  Sways:  0 to 10  11 to 20  21 to 30    Argueta Claros was offered a Preliminary Breath Test to which he refused.  ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Argueta Claros was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:      Odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle and his breath      Almost sideswiping another vehicle      Eyes glassy and bloodshot      Clues observed during field sobriety      Admission of consuming alcoholic beverages     Argueta Claros was arrested at 0612 hours.
