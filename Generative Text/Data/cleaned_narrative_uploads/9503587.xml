         <NarrativeText>On Friday, March 17, 2023 at approximately 1947 hours, I responded to the area of Route 224 (Riverside Road) and Rick Hamilton Place, Nanjemoy, Charles County, MD 20662 for the report of a single motor vehicle collision with injuries. Upon my arrival, I observed a silver Honda Civic bearing VA registration TYW8763 off the roadway, off of Rick Hamilton Place, with significant front end damage. I made contact with the driver, identified by his VA drivers license as Morataya Benitez, Giovanni (DOB: 04/29/2003), who advised me he was traveling with two passengers, one identified by her VA drivers license as Rivas Vasquez, Jacqueline Alexandra (DOB: 05/16/2004) and the other identified by name and date of birth as Lara Sanchez, Dulce Alejandra (DOB: 06/24/2003). I was advised that Lara Sanchez was being flown out to Capitol Regional Medical Center via Trooper 2 with life-threatening injuries. Maryland State Police Reconstructionist TFC Posch #6749 was contacted and responded to the scene.  Morataya Benitez advised me he was attempting to pass two vehicles ahead of him when he lost control of his vehicle, traveled off of Route 224 onto Rick Hamilton Place and struck a solid metal pole. Rivas Vasquez was standing by with Lara Sanchez at the landing zone until Lara Sanchez was taken to the hospital. Rivas Vasquez responded to the scene shortly after and corroborated what Morataya Benitez had advised transpired. Initial investigation revealed the Honda was traveling southbound on Route 224 when it attempted to pass two vehicles ahead, but in doing so, lost control, traveled onto Rick Hamilton Place and struck a solid metal pole.  Lara Sanchez was listed as stable and released from the hospital the following day. Traffic charges for Morataya Benitez are pending.  The Honda was towed from the scene by Stoneys Towing and taken to their tow lot.  All events occurred in Charles County, MD. </NarrativeText>
