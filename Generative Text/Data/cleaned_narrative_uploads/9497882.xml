Muhammad, in full uniform operating marked Maryland State Police vehicle R-7 in full capacity, was dispatched I-83 in the area of Falls Road for a motor vehicle collision. As I arrived on scene at approximately 0127 hours, I observed a black Volkswagen Jetta with the hazards light on. As I approached the vehicle from the driver side door I made contact with Lucas Collins Gutirrez (1/M 08-11-1996). Gutirrez stated that he was driving on I-83 in the area of Falls Road when a vehicle sideswiped his vehicle on the passenger side. Gutirrez stated that the striking vehicle failed to stop after the collision. I asked Gutirrez for his drivers license, registration, and insurance information and advised him that once he gave me those items that he could wait in his vehicle. Gutirrez replied ok. Approximately five minutes after sitting back in his vehicle, Gutirrez approached me and asked and asked if I could call an ambulance because he needed to go to the hospital. Baltimore City EMS arrived on scene at 0150 hours.    While being evaluated by Baltimore City EMS, I heard Gutirrez say I have thoughts about hurting myself and other people. I asked Gutirrez what thoughts did he have about hurting himself. Gutirrez stated that he did not want to hell me how. I asked Gutirrez how did he want to hurt other people. Gutirrez stated I find whoever hurt me and then call the police on them. I asked Gutirrez for a second time if he still felt like hurting himself, and he replied yes. Gutirrez stated that he has been hospitalized in the past for having suicidal thoughts. I asked Gutirrez if he currently had any weapons on him and he stated no. I also asked Gutirrez if he ever owned a firearm or had access to one. Gutirrez stated no. At 0209 hours, I transported Gutirrez to the University of Maryland Medical Center.  Due to Gutierrez:    Stating that he wanted to harm himself and others  Stating that he has been hospitalized before for having suicidal thoughts  I requested that Gutirrez be evaluated for an emergency petition by University of Maryland Medical Center.  All events occurred in Baltimore City, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
