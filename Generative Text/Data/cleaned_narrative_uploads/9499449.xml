         <NarrativeText>Miguel Angel Castanares Maryland SOUNDEX: MD-10274088511 Breath Test Result:Refusal DWI Citation #: 4T20J79 DWI MVR/Body Cam #: Video tagged as 23-MSP-033517 (Axon View XL Software).   TROOPER CERTIFICATES / TRAINING / SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS  1. Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 2. Certified SFST Instructor. 3. Chemical Breath Test Operator. 4. Graduate of the University of Marylands DUI Institute. 5. Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland State Police. 6. Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.). 7. Trained in Cannabis Impairment Detection (Maryland State Police). 8. Assigned to the Berlin Barrack V Special Enforcement Team (focusing exclusively on DUI enforcement) from October 2017 - June 2022.   NARRATIVE   -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION-  On 09-23-2023 at approximately 2249 hours, I (Corporal J. Ruiz #6312), was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating marked MSP vehicle V-15 in the area of Maryland Route 90 westbound near Mile Marker 8 at the base of the Isle of Wight Bay Bridge (Ocean Pines). I was stationary, monitoring all westbound traffic. At this time, I observed a silver truck traveling westbound pass my location. I made the following observations on the same truck:  MD ROUTE 90 NEAR MILE MARKER 8  1. The vehicles right tires crossed (1 tire width) the solid white line into the right shoulder area on one (1) occasion. I could hear the sound of the tires striking the rumble strips because my patrol vehicle driver door window was approximately a quarter of the way down. The vehicle abruptly swerved back into the westbound lane.  I safely entered the roadway and closed in on the same truck prior to Mile Marker 7.  BETWEEN MILE MARKER 8 AND MILE MARKER 7  2. The vehicles right tires crossed the solid white shoulder line on five (5) occasions. The vehicle abruptly swerved back into the westbound lane on four (4) of those occasions.  3. The vehicles right tires were directly on top of the solid white shoulder line on three (3) occasions. The vehicle drifted back into its lane of traffic each time.  ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS   4. The vehicle failed to maintain proper lane position due to pronounced and excessive weaving (alternately moving toward one side of the lane and then the other) during the entire duration of my observations.  5. Total distance traveled was approximately 1.88 miles.   DWI INDICATORS / REASON FOR STOP  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA) published a The Visual Detection of DWIMotorists booklet in March 2010. The research revealed that DWI cues related to problems in maintaining proper lane position include:  1. Weaving 2. Weaving across lane lines 3. Drifting  All of the above DWI indicators were exhibited by the same truck prior to my initiating a traffic stop.   TRAFFIC STOP / STOPPING SEQUENCE OF VEHICLE  Prior to activating the emergency lights to my patrol vehicle, I observed the following:  1. As the truck entered the MD Route 589 exit, the trucks left tires crossed the solid white line on one (1) occasion. The truck abruptly swerved back into its lane of traffic.  I activated the emergency lights to my patrol vehicle with enough time and roadway space for the truck to pull over immediately to the right shoulder area. Instead, the truck continued northbound on the exit and made a left turn onto southbound Racetrack Road (another approximately 1,000 feet) before pulling over onto the right shoulder area. The truck drifted into the grassy portion of the shoulder area before coming to a complete stop. The vehicle was a silver 2015 Ford F-150 bearing Maryland registration 4EN7637.   -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT-  I made contact with the driver via the driver side door, and I immediately smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I explained the reason for the stop and requested the drivers license and the registration card to the vehicle. The driver was identified as Miguel Angel Castanares by his Maryland drivers license. I asked Castanares where he was traveling from, and I could not understand his response because Castanares looked over to the front seat passenger twice during this question. I asked Castanares where he was traveling to, and he replied: Home. I asked Castanares how much he had to drink earlier in the evening, and he advised: 2 glasses of wine.   As Castanares spoke, I made the following observations:  1. I intentionally observed his eyes to be glassy and bloodshot.  2. Castanares displayed a glazed look/expression on his face as he interacted with me.  3. Though he spoke with an accent, Castanares displayed a good command of the English language.   I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks on Castanares.  I later returned to the Ford and requested Castanares exit the vehicle and walk to the front of it, to which he complied. While at the front of the vehicle, I continued to speak with Castanares. I asked Castanares again where he was traveling from, and he stated: We just had our anniversary. We just got dinner and headed home to Ocean Pines. During my second interaction with Castanares, I observed the following:  1. I asked Castanares where he had dinner at, and he responded: Hobbit.  2. When asked how many total alcoholic beverages he had consumed prior to driving, Castanares replied: A bottle of wine. We didnt finish it. So, maybe 2 glasses of wine.  3. When asked at approximately what time he had finished consuming his last drink prior to driving, Castanares advised: Couple hours. I mean, not a couple hours but a little before, sir.  4. As Castanares spoke, I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I informed Castanares that I wanted him to perform field sobriety tests which he agreed to submit to.   -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING-  STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs)  The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder area. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight and vehicle headlamps. Weather was light rain and approximately 68 degrees. I asked Castanares if he had any significant medical issues with his eyes, arms, or legs which would prevent him from performing the field sobriety tests or if he had taken any medication prior to driving. Castanares responded: No. Castanares appeared to be in general good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, limps, or any limb ailments.  Castanares was wearing a gray long sleeve collar shirt, dark gray pants, and brown casual boots.    **HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: 6 of 6 clues**   1. Castanares displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.  2. Castanares displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.  3. Castanares displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.   **WALK AND TURN: 4 of 8 clues**  1. Castanares could not maintain his balance during the Instruction Phase. Castanares feet broke from the start position on two (2) occasions (1st occasion he stumbled forward, 2nd occasion he stumbled to his right).  2. Castanares missed heel-to-toe on step 6 during the first series.  3. Castanares did not complete the turn in a satisfactory manner, lifting his lead foot and losing his balance while turning.  4. Castanares stepped off the line on step 2 during the first series (lost balance).   **ONE LEG STAND: 0 of 4 clues**   ADDITIONAL ANNOTATIONS REFERENCE FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS  Walk And Turn (WAT):   The solid white shoulder line was used for this test.    PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT)  After the conclusion of all Field Sobriety Tests, I offered Castanares the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). Castanares refused.   ARREST  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Castanares was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:  * Driving vehicle in a negligent manner which caused it to commit 10 lane violations in addition to excessive weaving DRIVING SKILLS IMPAIRED. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. * Eyes glassy and bloodshot. * Glazed look/expression on face. * Admission to consuming at least one (1) alcoholic beverage prior to operating a motor vehicle. * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.   I determined that Castanares was impaired by the presence of an alcoholic beverage in his system that adversely affected his ability to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. The inability to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests properly can also adversely affect the persons ability to operate a motor vehicle safely. I placed Castanares under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2307 hours on 09-23-2023. At this time, I visually inspected the inside of Castanares mouth for any foreign objects and none were found.    ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)  Castanares was placed and secured in the right front seat of my patrol vehicle. Castanares was given his Advice of Rights via the audio version of the DR-15 Form (played through the patrol vehicles laptop speakers). A copy of the DR-15 Form was placed directly in front of Castanares, attached to the sun visor. Castanares immediately stated that he could not read the printed form and asked that I take it down from the sun visor. At the conclusion of the audio version, I verbally re-explained the drivers license sanctions and penalties (section printed in red) to Castanares.  During this time, Castanares freely uttered that he previously worked for the cities of Ocean City and Delmar as a firefighter. He also stated that English was not his first language. When I offered to play the Spanish audio version of the DR-15 Form to Castanares, Castanares declined. I afforded Castanares the opportunity to make a final decision on the breath test upon arrival at the Berlin Barrack, and Castanares agreed.    TRANSPORT / BREATH TEST DECISION  Castanares was subsequently transported to the Berlin Barrack for processing. Upon arrival, I again verbally explained the drivers license sanctions and penalties to Castanares. Castanares freely uttered that he was concerned about any ramifications in reference to the custody of his daughter if he submitted to a breath test. During this interaction, I continued to smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Castanares breath and person. Castanares eventually stated that he understood his Advice of Rights and refused to submit to a breath test at approximately 2345 hours on 09-23-2023.   PLACEMENT INTO CELL #2 / RELEASE  Castanares was placed into Cell #2 during processing. Castanares exited Cell #2 at the time of his release. After exiting Cell #2, I entered the cell in order to perform a visual search of the cell. There was a distinct and strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of Cell #2. The odor was not present at the time Castanares entered the cell.  Castanares was provided all forms and citations prior to his release. Castanares was released to a sober person at approximately 0021 hours on 09-24-2023.   CHARGES  Castanares was charged with the following citations:  1. Driving Vehicle While Under The Influence Of Alcohol (4T20J79) 2. Driving Vehicle While Impaired By Alcohol (4T30J79) 3. Failure To Obey Traffic Control Device (4T40J79) 4. Negligent Driving (4T50J79)   Case closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
