         <NarrativeText>Defendant: Dmitriy Shustov Andreevich Date of Birth: 01/15/2002 Time of Arrest: 0117 DWI#: 23-037   CERIFCATES AND TRAINING *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. *Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E)   VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On January 19, 2023, at approximately 0046 hours, I Trooper Hunt #7356 was on duty in official capacity as Maryland State Trooper operating Marked MSP vehicle R-27 on northbound 695 at Reisterstown road, Baltimore County, Maryland. I observed a white Toyota Camry bearing MD registration 5FC4253 stopped on the left shoulder with the rear end of the vehicle partially in lane 1.   PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the operator on the drivers side door and immediately smelled a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I observed that the tire was parallel with the axel broken, and damage to the driver side front bumper. I asked the operator if they were ok and they stated yes, I asked the operator to tell me what happen and they stated that they struck the side reals. As the operator was speaking I observed slurred speech, glassy and bloodshot eyes. I requested a license and registration. The operator was identified by his MD drivers license as Dmitriy Shustov Andreevic, (W/M), DOB: 01/15/2002. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct a routine check on Andreevic. I returned to Andreevic who was standing in front of my patrol vehicle due to the tow truck taking his vehicle and asked him where he was coming from, Andreevic stated that he was coming from his friends residents who lived in Reisterstown. I asked Andreevic how many alcoholic beverages he consumed and stated around 8 oclock had one angry orchard beer. I informed Andreevic I wanted him to perform a standardize field sobriety test and he agreed to take it.      PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)  The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder on Westbound I-695 prior to cove road. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear, cold and it was dark outside. Andreevic appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries, limp, or any limb ailments.  I asked Andreevic the following questions: Injuries- No Medication- No Medical Conditions- No Glasses/Contacts- No observed   HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 CLUES OBSERVED)  The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was use as the stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Andreevic eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Andreevics pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking and no resting Nystagmus was observed. I asked Andreevic if he understood the instructions and he stated yes.    Lack of smooth pursuit- present in both eyes  Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- present in both eyes  Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees- present in both eyes  Vertical Gaze Nystagmus- not present   WALK AND TURN (/8 CLUES OBSERVED)  Prior to Andreevic performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Andreevic was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Andreevic was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Andreevic was advised to take (9) steps on a straight-line touching heel to toe every step. Andreevic was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Andreevic was explained and demonstrated to his lead foot on the line, and to take series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Andreevic was again explained and demonstrated the second series of (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Andreevic was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Andreevic if he understood the test and he stated yes. During the instructional stage, Andreevic had trouble understanding the test. I explained the test a second time and as I was demonstrating, Andreevic come out of the starting stance. After I was done demonstrating the test, I told Andreevic he can begin and then Andreevic began to stretch his legs and do squats before performing the test. During the walk and turn test Andreevic took 23 steps instead of nine, I told Andreevic to stop walking and to walk nine steps back, Andreevic took 13 steps back.   Instructional stage Couldnt maintain balance Walking stage (1st Nine)    Misses heel-toe five times   Steps off line three times    Walking stage (2nd Nine)    Misses heel-toe five times    Turn Improper turn  wasnt preformed due to Andreevic taking over nine steps and I had to tell him to stop walking.      ONE LEG STAND (4/4 CLUES OBSERVED) Prior to Andreevic performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Andreevic was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (One thousand- one, one thousand- two) and to continue the test until told to stop. I asked Andreevic if he understood the test and he stated, Yes.  Balance and Count Stage: Seconds 0-10:    Sways once    Seconds 11-20: Nothing observed  Seconds 21-30: Nothing observed   Arrest Based on the following, I had reason to believe that Andreevic was driving under the influence of alcoholic. I arrested Andreevic at approximately 0117 hours and placed him in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. I was enroute to the Golden Ring Barrack for DUI processing. While enroute to barrack, I played the English audio version of the DR-15 Advice of Rights from to Andreevic. At the conclusion of the audio, Andreevic agreed to take the intoximeter test at approximately at 0140 hours. After arriving to the barrack, I took Andreevic into the intoximeter room where he had a result of .12 BrAC. Andreevic was issued all the appropriate paperwork and released to a sober ride.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, Maryland.   </NarrativeText>
