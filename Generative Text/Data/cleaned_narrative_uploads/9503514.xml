Team.  * I have successfully completed the Marijuana DUI Investigation online course through the Central Valley California HIDTA.  * I attended the six-month Maryland State Police Academy in Sykesville, Maryland. While there, I was also trained in the detection, identification and processing of numerous controlled dangerous substances. Prior to becoming a Maryland State Trooper, I was a prior Police Officer for approximately four years in the State of Pennsylvania working in high crime areas (Cities of Philadelphia and Chester) known for drug trafficking. During my time as a Maryland State Trooper, I was temporarily assigned for approximately six months to the Wicomico County Narcotics Task Force (WINTF) where I assisted with investigations involving Controlled Dangerous Substances. I have also attended specialized training involving the possession, sale, and processing of controlled dangerous substances, and continue to do so.  NARRATIVE:  PHASE #1  VEHICLE IN MOTION:  On Friday, January 13, 2023, at approximately 0353 hours, I, TFC. M. Hughes #7111 responded to 1480 East Old Philadelphia Road, Elkton, Maryland 21921 in reference to a single vehicle crash.    Upon my arrival, I observed a 2015 white VW Jetta displaying Delaware registration 961459 facing westbound off the roadway to the right of the westbound travel lane. The aforementioned vehicle was disabled due to a collision with a powerline pole #38976/38323 which did not appear to be damaged.    A check of the vehicle for occupants was negative, however, an employee identification card belonging to Julian Thomas Fleck 03/09/2006 was located inside the vehicle which was registered to a Tracy Lanetter Murray DOB 01/09/1974. While collecting information, I was approached by the caller who was identified as Christian Gregory Doyle DOB 04/15/1959. During later conversation with Doyle, he reported a male and a female were observed/heard near the vehicle during the time of the collision; however, they were quickly picked up by another vehicle. Doyle could not give a description of the hit and run suspects due to poor lighting.   While conducting checks on the vehicle, and a possible occupant(s), I observed a 2017 white Ford Explorer displaying Maryland registration 9DP2788 driving past the scene while traveling westbound on East Old Philadelphia Road. After passing, this vehicle stopped for several seconds in the westbound lane approximately 50-100 feet west of the collision. The vehicle then began to drive away which I stopped due to the suspicious circumstances. The driver (Murray) advised her son (Fleck) reported to her that the vehicle was stolen. I then requested Murray pick up her Fleck who was at a nearby friends residence and transport him back to the scene so that I could interview him in reference to the vehicle being stolen.    At approximately 0423 hours, Crouse Towing arrived on scene which was initially dispatched to conduct a state storage on the crashed vehicle. Shortly after Crouses arrival, Murray returned the scene with Fleck and a juvenile female occupant.    PHASE #2  PERSONAL CONTACT:  While interviewing Fleck, he advised his girlfriend (the juvenile female occupant) and him drove to nearby location to go site seeing. Fleck said after arriving, they proceeded to their destination on foot; however, they were turned away after observing no trespassing signs. Fleck advised the two returned to the location of the vehicle which was gone.    I informed Fleck that there was a witness who reported there was a male and female on scene during the time of the collision who were picked up by another vehicle. I then advised Fleck if he was driving, he would be dealing with traffic related charges and that he would be charged criminally with false reporting. Fleck then admitted to driving the vehicle at the time of the collision. While speaking to Fleck from the drivers door window, who was seated in the front passenger seat chewing gum, I detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverages coming from inside the vehicle.   Due to the circumstance, I requested Fleck exit the vehicle. During further conversation with Fleck, he reported he was attempting to show off to his girlfriend while driving. Fleck said he pulled the emergency brake which caused him to drift off the wet roadway. I asked Fleck how many alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving. Fleck denied consuming any alcoholic beverages.    While speaking with Fleek outside of the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverages coming from his breath and person.    PHASE #3  PRE-ARREST SCREENING:  I asked Fleck to participate in Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Fleck agreed to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.  PRE-SCREENING QUESTIONS:  I asked Fleck a series of questions prior to performing Standardized Field Sobriety Tests:  * Glasses/Contacts: None. * Injuries/Disabilities: None. * Medications or Drugs: Prescribed Adderall at 2200 hours on Thursday, January 12, 2023. * Mouth Check: Clear.  HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST:    I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN) to Fleck. After explaining the test, I asked Fleck if he understood the test which he stated he understood the test. I then completed the following checks before beginning the test.During this test, I observed Flecks eyes as bloodshot and glassy.   Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes  Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation: Present Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees: Present Vertical Gaze Nystagmus: Not Present   Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues:6 of 6  WALK  TURN TEST:  WEATHER: Clear SURFACE: Road pavement free of debris and wet FOOTWEAR: Crocks which Fleck removed for the remainder of the tests.  I proceeded by instructing Fleck into the instructional stance. I next demonstrated the test and gave Fleck additional instructions. During the instructional phase of this test, I had to stop and place Fleck back into the instructional stance several times. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Fleck if he understood the test. Fleck advised he did and then was advised to begin.   INSTRUCTIONAL PHASE: Could not keep balance: twice  WALKING STAGE 1ST NINE: Missed heel-to-toe: steps one, two, three, four (almost fell over on this step), six, eight and nine Stepped off line: steps five and seven Incorrect number of steps: ten steps taken Used arms for balance (beyond six inches from the sides)  TURN: Unsatisfactorily: used both feet (turned towards his right)  WALKING STAGE 2ND NINE: Missed heel-to-toe: steps two Stepped off line: step three  Used arms for balance (beyond six inches from the sides)  Total Walk and Turn Clues:6 of 8  ONE LEG STAND TEST:  LEG RAISED: Right  I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Fleck. I then asked Fleck if he understood the test and he stated he did. Fleck then began the test by picking up his right foot.   SECONDS 1-10: Sway  SECONDS 11-20: Sway  SECONDS 21-30: Sway Used arms for balance (beyond six inches from the sides)  Total One Leg Stand Clues:2 of 4   PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST:  Not Offered/Not Available  ARREST  TRANSPORT:   After completing these tests, I again asked Fleck how many alcoholic beverages he consumed prior to driving. Fleck then admitted to consuming two Twisted Tea alcoholic beverages. During further questioning, Fleck admitted to drinking upwards to four Twisted Tea alcoholic beverages.    Based on the following, I had reason to believe Fleck was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol:  * Fleck observed with bloodshot/glassy eyes * The odor of alcoholic beverages detected coming from Flecks person and breath * Fleck admitting to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving * Fleck being eighteen-years-old with an alcohol restriction * My observed signs of impairment  Due to my observations, I placed Fleck under arrest for driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0435 hours.  20 MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:   Upon our arrival at Maryland State Police Barrack F North East, I read the DR-15 Advice of Rights to Fleck while providing him with a copy of the DR-15 to follow along with. After reading the DR-15, Fleck agreed to the alcohol concentration test signing the DR-15 at approximately 0501 hours.  ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION TEST:  INSTRUMENT SERIAL NUMBER: 011750 CERTIFIED EXPIRATION DATE: 06/30/2023 TEST TECHNICIAN: Sgt. Black #5325     At approximately 0515 hours, Fleck gave a breath specimen which was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .09 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.    DISPOSITION: After processing, Fleck was released to Murray in the front lobby at Maryland State Police Barrack F North East. Murray signed the juvenile referral, which she was given a copy of. Fleck was given copies of all pertinent paperwork.  Delmarva Power was notified to come out and inspect the pole at a later date/time; however, theres been no update if damage was actually called as of today, Saturday, January 21, 2023.  Fleck was not truthful at times; however, he was extremely polite throughout the entire process.  All times in this report are approximate. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
