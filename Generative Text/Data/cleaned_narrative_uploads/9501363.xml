         <NarrativeText>On Tuesday, October 31st, 2023 at approximately 1745, myself and Cpl. Wynne #6594, Anne Arundel County Police, and EMS responded to eastbound I-695 at Ritchie Hwy. for a reported shooting with one victim sustaining a gunshot wound to the leg. Anne Arundel County Officer Spates # 2442 was one of the first responders on scene and observed the victim, later identified as James Richard Rhodes 9/11/00, with a gunshot wound high on his left leg. Officer Spates applied pressure on the wound until EMS arrived on scene.Cpl. Wynne arrived on scene. Rhodes was transported to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center,22 S Greene St, Baltimore, MD 21201, via Medic # 32 run # 202379961. I arrived on the scene afterRhodes was transported to the hospital. I observed a red Subaru Impreza hatchback bearing Maryland registration 5FP1395 on the left shoulder of I-695. I observed one bullet hole in the drivers door and the window of the drivers door was shattered. After speaking with Cpl. Wynne and Officer Spates,Rhodes was allegedly involved in a road rage incident with another vehicle described as a red Dodge Grand Caravan bearing Maryland registration 9FD1470. The driver of the Dodge allegedly shot atRhodes, to which the bullet traveled through the drivers door and struckRhodes left leg while driving. Officer Spates was provided with the suspects tag and vehicle description and was able to showRhodes a picture of the registered owner, whoRhodes positively identified as the suspect. The suspect was identified as the registered owner of the Dodge, Keith Bryant Felton Jr. 3/25/99. Rhodes was not certain of the exact place the shooting occurred and had driven a short distance until he pulled over on the left shoulder of I-695 at Ritchie Hwy. An Anne Arundel County Police helicopter was airborne and was searching the area for the suspect vehicle. The helicopter flew over the suspects listed address of 6315 Seton Ridge Dr. in Gwynn Oak, Maryland searching for the vehicle. The suspect vehicle was not located at the residence at that time. Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division was notified. Cpl. Wynne responded to shock trauma to stay withRhodes. I remained on scene withRhodes vehicle.Rhodes vehicle was towed to the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack by White Huff Towing for further investigation. The vehicle was secured in the barrack vehicle storage lot at 1820 hrs.  At 1940 hrs, Scott Brice Evans 3/7/1990, (443) 904-7361, called the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack stating he witnessed the shooting on I-695. Evans stated he observed the red Subaru and red Dodge both engaged in a road rage situation, cutting each other off, etc. eastbound on I-695 in the area of Route 1. Evans stated the aggressive driving continued in the area of I-97 where he saw the driver of the Subaru holding his cell phone up to the window and heard possibly 3 gun shots come from the Dodge. Evans stated after the shooting, the Dodge continued on southbound I-97 at a high rate of speed. Evans information was provided to S/Tpr Costello #5827 assigned to the Criminal Enforcement Division to follow up.   All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. I request this case remain open and forwarded to Criminal Enforcement Division and Crime Scene for further investigation.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Transport of Keith Felton</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Incident Date: October 31 and November 1, 2023  Incident: Transport of Keith Felton and other assist actions  Attachments: 1) Body Worn Camera footage from search warrant and transport of prisoner 2) Arrest photos of Keith Felton taken at Glen Burnie Barrack  Narrative: On October 31, 2023 I became aware of a first degree assault investigation being conducted by members of the MSP Glen Burnie Barrack and Southern Region Criminal Enforcement Division. I responded to assist with a search warrant being conducted at6315 Seton Ridge Dr, Gwynn Oak, MD. While executing the search warrant, the identified suspect Keith Felton was taken into custody. Felton was placed into my agency issued vehicle at approximately 0444 hours and I transported him to Glen Burnie Barrack. My agency issued BWC was activated the entire time and the footage has been uploaded to evidence.com.  Upon arrival at the Glen Burnie Barrack I also took three photos of Felton which were also documented on evidence.com and are further attached to this report. Felton appeared healthy the entire time I was with him and never exhibited any physical issues.  For further details regarding this investigation, refer to supplements by S/T Costello.  Case closed.  </NarrativeText>
