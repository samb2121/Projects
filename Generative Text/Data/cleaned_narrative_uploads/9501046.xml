         <NarrativeText>Patrol Vehicle Q-34 is equipped with an in-car camera. Incident was captured on in-car and body worn camera.  Crime: Driving Under the Influence Defendant: Jose Antonio Perez Toro DOB:03/31/1979 Date of Arrest: 11/25/2023 Time of Arrest: 0209 hours License#: P623440067254 DUI #: 23-292 DUI Citation #: 0790ZHZ Accident Involved: No  CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING:  * I am trained to administer standardized field sobriety tests. (Eastern Shore Criminal Justice Academy 2019, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Maryland State Police Academy 2023) * I am trained to administer the Preliminary Breath Test. (Eastern Shore Criminal Justice Academy 2019, Maryland State Police Academy 2023) * I am a trained RADAR/LIDAR operator (Snow Hill Police Department, Worcester County Sheriffs Office 2019, Maryland State Police 2023) * I am trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (Maryland State Police, A.R.I.D.E., 2023)  NARRATIVE:  Phase #1 - Vehicle In Motion:   On November 25, 2023 at approximately 0130 hours I, Trooper Crystal Merritt #7665, of the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack was on patrol in the area of Northbound Capital Beltway (I495) in the area of Baltimore Avenue (RT1). I was operating Maryland State Police Marked Ford Explorer Q-34. I observed a white GMC Sierra bearing Maryland registration 4DL9348 travelling Northbound on Capital Beltway (I495) in lane three, between two semi-tractor trailers. The GMC was traveling noticeably slower than other traffic on the roadway, causing it to be overpassed by other vehicles in the immediate area. I observed the GMC to drift back and forth within its lane of travel. I observed the operator of the GMC to activate its right turn signal and then immediately drift to the left, crossing the lane division pavement marking, and completely occupy lane two. The GMC then drifted back into lane three, across the lane division pavement marking, and then continued into lane four before maintaining a position occupying lane three. The GMC crossed back over into lane three and drove with half of the vehicle occupying lane three and half of the vehicle occupying lane four, straddling the lane division pavement marking. The GMC traveled in this manor for approximately 15 seconds before swerving to the right and touching the white solid fog line in lane four. The GMC continued to swerve back and forth within its lane. I activated my emergency equipment which consist of red and blue strobing lights, and an audible siren, to initiate a lawful traffic stop. Upon activation of my emergency equipment the GMC crossed the white solid fog line by an entire tire width, and then continued to travel slowly in lane four before activating its flashers and ultimately coming to a stop on the right shoulder of Capital Beltway (I495) just prior to Baltimore Avenue (RT1).   Phase #2 - Personal Contact    Upon approach to the vehicle I made contact with the operator, later identified as Jose Antonio Perez Toro [hereinafter identified as Toro]. I identified myself and advised Toro for the reason of the stop, and that he was being audibly and visibly recorded. I immediately could detect the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Toros vehicle. I observed Toros eyes to be bloodshot and glassy, his speech to be slow and slurred, and his movements to be lethargic. Toro did not have his vehicle in park, and placed it in back after the vehicle drifted forward approximately 2-3 inches. When asked, Toro stated he was coming from a party. Toro was able to provide all requested paperwork.  I requested Toro exit his vehicle. I observed Toro to stumble and sway back and forth while walking to the front of his vehicle. Toro ran into the front of his vehicle with his right side. I advised Toro of my intent to conduct Standardized Field Sobriety tests. When asked if he would voluntarily submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, Toro stated that he would.   I asked Toro a series of questions for pre-screening prior to performing the Standardized Field Sobriety tests. Toro stated that he had two (2) beers around two hours ago.    Phase #3 - Pre Arrest Screening     Do you take medications of any kind: No Do you wear contacts or glasses: No Any injuries or disabilities: No  Toro continued outside of the vehicle, and throughout the duration of our conversation to emit a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person.   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus   I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Toro and ensured Toro could see the stimulus, to which he replied and visually confirmed that he could. I asked Toro if he had and questions, to which he replied he did not.  Toro turned his head to follow the stimulus after being instructed to keep his head still. I instructed Toro to keep his head still. Toro would stop tracking the stimulus, and would have to be reminded to continue.  Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes  Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation present in both eyes Onset of nystagmus prior to forty-five degrees present in both eyes Vertical Nystagmus: No  Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues: 6 out of 6    Walk and Turn   Weather: Clear Surface: Level surface, clear of any debris. I observed Toro to be wearing boots, which he stated he was comfortable in.  I instructed Toro into the instructional phase where he was instructed to remain until I told him to begin the test, to which he was unable to maintain the heel to toe position.  Instructional Phase: -Cannot maintain balance (Could not maintain his balance and broke the instructional position by moving his right foot.)  Walking stage 1st 9: - Misses heel to toe on step (1,3,4) -Steps off line step (1)  Toro stepped off line to the right with his right foot -Incorrect number of steps (10)  Turn: -Incorrect- did not complete turn properly, stepped off to the left Walking stage 2nd 9:  -Missed heel to toe on every step -Incorrect number or steps (10)  Total Walk and Turn Clues: 5 of 8   One Leg Stand  I next explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Toro. Toro was instructed into the instructional position. Toro stated he was having trouble understanding the instructions for this test. Trooper J. Gonzales of the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack assisted, and explained the test in Spanish. Toro lifted his left foot for the test.  Seconds 1-10: -Puts foot down (second 4) (second 9)  Toro tripped to the right -Swayed  Seconds 11-20: -Puts foot down (second 16)  Seconds 21-30: - Puts foot down (second 27) -Swayed Total One Leg Stand Clues: 2 of 4  Preliminary Breath Test  When offered the Preliminary Breath Test, Toro stated that he wanted to take the test. Toros PBT results read as a .27.    Arrest and Transport  Based on the following, I had reason to believe Toro was driving a motor vehicle under the influence: *Observed driving behavior *Eyes glassy and bloodshot *Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his vehicle *Odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person *Toros self-admittance to consuming alcohol *Toros poor performance on SFST   Toro was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0209 hours, Toro was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely. Toro was searched incident to arrest. I placed Toro into the front passenger seat of marked patrol vehicle Q-34. I then entered my patrol vehicle at which time I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage that was not present in my vehicle prior to placing Toro into my vehicle. Toros vehicle was tagged and secured off of the roadway.     I transported Toro to the Maryland State Police College Park barrack for processing. Toro was played and provided a copy of the MVA DR-15 advice of rights in Spanish. Toro agreed the test and signed the DR15 at 0220 hours. Sergeant D. Parsons, a certified breath technician operator, administered the test at 0311 hours. The test results in .17 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.   Toro was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to a sober driver at 0330 hours.  All events did occur in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
