         <NarrativeText>Unmarked patrol car F-24 is equipped with an in-car camera. I am equipped with an Axon body worn camera (MSP#: 00016901). This incident was recorded. Scene Processing:   Crime scene was secured and marked off with crime scene tape.  Written statement taken from one witness and two cashiers.   margin-left:8px"&gt;Crime scene log initiated.  Attachments:    (4) Photographs  (3) MSP Form 076   margin-left:8px"&gt;(1) Crime scene log  Narrative:  On September 14, 2023, at approximately 1821 hours, I responded to the Highs gas station, 5655 Telegraph Road, Elkton, Maryland 21921 in reference to a strong-armed robbery attempt.  Upon arrival the Barrack broadcasted a bolo for a white male wearing a black mesh ski mask, black hooded jacket with the hood up, and dark pants. The suspect fled the store after demanding money from the cash register. The subject pointed an unknown object underneath his shirt at the cashier. The subject fled West on Telegraph road riding a black unknown dual sport motorcycle bearing unknown registration.  At approximately 1833 hours, I arrived on scene and made contact with the victim who was later identified as Bobbi Jo Lynn Ressler (DOB: 06/12/1990, W/F). Ressler advised an unknown white male approximately 508-600 height, 160-190lbs, darkish brown hair, light colored scruffy facial hair, messed up teeth, wearing a black mesh ski mask, black jacket with camouflage, and black pants attempted to rob the store at approximately 1758 hours. Ressler further advised the subject parked his black dual sport motorcycle directly in front of the front in the parking lot. The subject then entered the store and walked to the back refrigerators to grab one mountain dew soda bottle. The subject walked up to Resslers cash register, sat down the mountain dew soda bottle on the counter, and asked for two packs of Newport cigarettes. Ressler stated she told the subject to remove his mask to make sure he was the legal age to purchase the requested cigarettes. At that time, the subject had his hand in his right pocket, pointing an unknown object through his pocket at Ressler, and began to demand Ressler to open the register. Ressler advised the subject demanded all the money out of the cash register, telling her to hurry up numerous times. Ressler further advised she attempted to hit the registers panic button. A regular customer and sole witness was at the adjacent register. Ressler stated the subject then fled out the front door with no merchandise or money. The subject got onto his motorcycle and fled the scene. Last known direction of travel was out of the stores parking lot onto West Telegraph Road. Ressler advised the subject left the mountain dew soda bottle on the counter, touched one refrigerator door, and smacked the side of the register.Based on the above, the Maryland State Police crime lab and CED was requested.  The other cashier who was working the adjacent cash register was present during the attempted robbery. The cashier was identified as Kyle Len Stone (DOB: 11/19/1992, W/M). Stone advised he witnessed the unknown subject point an unknown object through his hooded jacket right pocket. Stone further advised the subject demanded cash from the register, yelling at Ressler to hurry up on numerous occasions. Stone stated the subject appeared to get frustrated and fled the store with no merchandise or money.  The sole customer in the store at the time of the robbery was later identified as Brian Eldreth (DOB: 12/25/1967, W/M). Eldreth advised he saw the unknown subject on Appleton Road just north of the Highs gas station approximately 30 minutes prior to the subject attempting to rob the gas station. Eldreth was unable to make out the race of the subject but described his motorcycle as a grayish black worn dual sport. Eldreth described the subject as an unknown race male approximately 507-509 height, skinny build. Eldreth advised he was at the adjacent cash register during the time of the attempted robbery. Eldreth further advised he stood behind the subject and believes thats what caused him to flee the scene. Eldreth observed what he believed to be handgun in the subjects right hooded jacket pocket and a long-bladed knife behind his back.  I reviewed the stores video surveillance cameras which revealed the following: At 1758 hours, the subject enters the stores side lot traveling south on Appleton Road. The subject was operating a black dual sport motorcycle, wearing black pants, black camouflage jacket with the hood up. At 1758 hours, the subject double-parked his motorcycle directly in the front parking lot at the main entrance. At 1758 hours, the subject enters the store through the main entrance. The subject walked to the rear of the store to the back refrigerators and grabbed one mountain dew soda bottle. At 1759 hours, the subject approaches Resslers cash register. The subject had his hand in his right pocket with an unknown object. The subject then points the unknown object at Ressler and starts waving his left hand at Ressler. The subject then flees out the main entrance with no merchandise or money. At 1759 hours, the subject mounts his dual sport motorcycle and departs the store parking lot onto West Telegraph Road.  At approximately 2007 hours, CED Senior Trooper Orem #5656 arrived on scene and assumed the scene/investigation. At approximately 2051 hours, Crime scene technician Linda arrived on scene.  I request that this case be forwarded to CED. All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText> On September 14, 2023, I was requested to investigate an attempted robbery that occurred at the Highs store located at 5655 Telegraph Rd, Elkton, Cecil County, Maryland.  Upon my arrival at that location, I made contact with Troopers from the North East Barrack who had already secured the scene, viewed surveillance video and spoke with the victims and witnesses. They briefed me on what had occurred and advised that a tech from the MSP Crime lab was on their way. There was an additional witness that was interviewed and released prior to my arrival, but the troopers were able to obtain all of his contact information. I then began interviewing the victims.   Interview with store employees Bobbi Jo Lyn Ressler- Cashier Kyle Len Stone- Store employee  The following interviews were recorded on body-worn camera.   I spoke to both Ressler and Stone at the same time in front of the Highs. Both employees were standing behind the counter talking to a frequent customer. At that time, a subject pulls into the parking lot on a motorcycle at around 1758 parking directly in front of the store. The subject then enters the store wearing black sweatpants, a hooded sweatshirt that was black on the bottom and camouflaged on the top, arms and hood, and had a mask covering the lower half of his face. The subject then walked directly to the beverage case where he selected a Mountain Dew and takes it up to the register. Another customer moves aside so he can complete his purchase, and the suspect asks for two packs of cigarettes. Ressler gets the cigarettes and starts to ring them up and asks the suspect to lower his mask so she could verify his age. At that time, the suspect leans over the counter with his right hand in his sweatshirt pocket thrust forward implying he had a gun or some sort of weapon and demanded that the cashier give him the money from the drawer. As the suspect leaned forward, he placed his ungloved left hand on the counter. The cashier made an attempt to open the drawer, but was unable to do so and the suspect abruptly left the store at 1759 hours. The suspect drove away from the store on an unknown make/model motorcycle and there is no tag visible on the video.   Neither employee was able to recall any distinct features about the suspect that could help identify him.  Scene Processing   Shortly after my arrival, CST L. Idso from the MSP Crime Lab arrived to process the scene. CST Idso and I discussed the case and watched the surveillance video to determine what needed to be processed. Based on what was observed, CST Idso determined that the soda bottle the suspect brought to the cashier and the counter where the suspect touched would be the only viable items to be swabbed and dusted for prints. CST Idso took overall photographs of the scene, dusted the soda bottle for fingerprints and swabbed the bottle and the counter for DNA. (According to the employees, the countertop is supposed to be wiped numerous times per day.) Because Ms. Ressler touched the bottle to scan it, CST Idso also obtained an exclusionary DNA sample from her. A few possible prints were lifted from the soda bottle to be sent to the lab. AN MSP 234 was sent to J. Befus of the MSP crime lab to see if they would accept the DNA for processing.   Case remains open. </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On September 20, 2023, I sent an MSP 234 to the MSP Crime lab to request analysis of DNA collected from the scene. On September 27, 2023, J. Befus, the forensic science supervisor, advise they would not analyze the DNA until/unless a suspect is identified and instructed me to maintain the samples until that time.    Additionally, on September 27, 2023, I received the crime scene report from CST Idso outlining the effort she put into the case. That document is attached to this supplement.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>  On January 8, 2023, I received the latent print report from the MSP Forensics Crime Lab. That report indicates there were seven latent prints suitable for AFIS entry that were encoded in to the Maryland and FBI systems. A search of the database revealed no matches. At this time, there are no additional leads to follow on the case.  Case suspended due to lack of suspect leads.</NarrativeText>
