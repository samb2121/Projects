         <NarrativeText>Video / Audio Recordings:  -TFC Devin (#7046) / Car- B-62// Body worn Camera is available // In-car Camera is not available. -Assisting Trooper-No assisting troopers/officers. Case Information: Dog bite Victim: Harkcom, Jeffrey Scott (DOB: 12/15/1982) Dog owner- Carter, Deborah Baumgartner (DOB: 08/09/1959) Suspect dog- Dobby Carter (DOB: UNK / approximately one year of age)  Date and time: 08/17/2023 at approximately 1600 hours Case #: 23-MSP-029142  On 08/17/2023, at approximately 21:50 hours, I, TFC Devin (#7046) of the Maryland State Police, was dispatched to respond to a residence located at, 18 Maple Ave, Walkersville, MD 21793 for a subject that got attacked by a dog.  Upon arrival, I met with the victim, who was identified by his Maryland Drivers License as, Jeffrey Scott Harkcom, (DOB: 12/15/1982). Harkcom explained that on 08/17/2023 earlier in the day, he was attacked by a dog, that bit his right hand. Harkcom explained that the breed of dog that attacked him was a Pitbull. Harkcom does not know the owners well, but he did speak with the owner after he was bitten. The owner and dog lives at, 14 Maple Ave; Walkersville, MD 21793, which is located a few residences down the street.  Harkcom refused any medical treatment, and advised that he did not want EMS to respond. Harkcom explained that he has already contacted Frederick County Animal Control, and they were informed of the incident. Harkcom advised that he just wanted to be safe, and report the incident, so he can receive a case number. Harkcom had several small scratches on his right hand, and one puncture wound from the dog latching onto his right hand. Harkcom also had a minor scratch on his upper left arm. I have attached photographs of Harkcoms injuries, and they can be found attached to this report.  The incident occurred in the backyard of Harkcoms address. Harkcom was watching his dog, when a Pitbull came rushing onto his property to attack his dog. Harkcom quickly grabbed his small dog, and put him on his shoulder to protect him. The Pitbull then approached Harkcom, and attacked. Harkcom was only bit one time, and he advised that the suspect dog was extremely aggressive. Harkcom felt that it was necessary to report this incident for the safety of the community. Animal Control advised Harkcom that they will report to his residence on 08/19/2023 to further investigate. I asked Harkcom if he believed the dog was trying to attack him, and he stated, Yes.  I reported to where the suspected dog was located which is, 14 Maple Ave, Walkersville, Maryland. I made contact with the owner of the Pitbull, who was identified by her Maryland Drivers License as, Deborah Carter (DOB: 08/19/1959). Carter advised that she was aware of the attack, and that her dog was recently tested for rabies. Carter stated that the test was negative, and she will locate the documentation to prove it. Carter explained that her dogs name is Dobby Carter, and he was just trying to attack Harkcoms dog. Carter explained that Dobby is not aggressive towards people. Carter has had Dobby for approximately one year.  Case Status: I request that this case be transferred to the Frederick County Animal Control.   All the above events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
