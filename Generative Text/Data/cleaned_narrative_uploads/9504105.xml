         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On January 20, 2023, I (TFC C. Strong #6699) made contact with Laura Ann Hill-McKinney (DOB: 09/13/1950 B/F) at the Centreville Barrack where she wanted to report money being stolen from her bank account. Hill-McKinney stated she was contacted by PNC Bank, by text message, and told $200 had been withdrawn from her account after a check had been cashed on January 18, 2023. Hill-McKinney advised she immediately went to the PNC banking app to look at her account and found a photo of the check that had been used. The Pay to the Order of line was filled in with the name Helena Hamilton-Turner. (Sin Fronteras Multiservices LLC, MD-0315, Intermex Wire Transfer LLC was written on the back of the check. Both Sin Fronteras and Intermex are different money transferring websites.) Hill-McKinney stated she knows Helena and has had issues in the past with Helena stealing money from her. Hill-McKinney stated that Helena is not allowed around her residence. She also has not spoken to her in over a year. Hill-McKinney looked a little further into her bank account and found that $200 more dollars had been withdrawn from 101 Hissey Road, which is the address to ATM located in Wawa. Hill-McKinney called her bank and informed them that she had not made those withdrawals. PNC put a hold on her account and advised her she needed to file a police report, and then they would go further with an investigation.  Hill-McKinney stated her account showed the $200 withdrawn from her account was posted on the 19th, but she was unsure when the money was actually taken from the ATM. Bank statements can sometimes take up to 24 hours, so I assumed it happened sometime on the 18th of January. I provided Hill-McKinney with a case number for her bank and advised her to contact the barrack if she found any other suspicious activity on her account.  A METERS/NCIC search showed Helena Cecilia Hamilton-Turner (DOB:12/06/1996 B/F) lives in Queenstown, MD and has previous theft charges. After looking at Hamilton-Turners license photo and her recent photos on Facebook, I went to Wawa in Grasonville to see if they had any camera footage for the ATM. I spoke with the General Manager, Deb Bonello, who advised they do not have a camera near the ATM, but there is one at the front entrance and another near the lottery machine that is on the same wall as the ATM. I advised Bonello that the money was most likely withdrawn on the 18th, but I did not know the time. I started at 0800 hours on January 18, 2023, and watched until January 19, 2023, at 2200 hours. On January 18, 2023, at approximately 1625 hours, a female walks into Wawa wearing a black sweatshirt and a black KN95 mask. The female matched the description of Hamilton-Turner. Hamilton-Turner is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 260 pounds. The female is in Wawa for 2 minutes, from 1625 hours to 1627 hours. It is unknown where she goes after she walks into the building because there are few cameras and the ATM is near a wall with only one, and it is pointed in the opposite direction. The general manager stated the cameras here suck. I watched the female exit the building and walk to the east side of the parking lot. You can only see half of the small, light colored passenger car. It could have possibly been a Mazda. When the female approaches the vehicle, she takes her mask and sweatshirt off and places them in the vehicle. I could not see her face because the camera footage was blurry.  After being on hold for 17 minutes, the employee for PNC Bank Customer Service, advised I needed to email their processing division, and they can assist me with any further information I need. An email was sent in regard to see if they can provide what time the ATM withdraw took place.  I attempted to call Hamilton-Turner with the phone number provided to me by Hill-McKinney, but there was no answer. An application for charges will be completed for Hamilton-Turner.  I request this case remain open pending further information.  All events occurred in Queen Annes County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Commissioner Alvarez advised there is not enough evidence to name Hamilton-Turner as the suspect in this case. I attempted to make contact with Hill-McKinney at her residence, but no one came to the door. Her vehicle was in the driveway and there were lights on in the home, I knocked on both doors and several windows, still no one answered. I called PNC Banks Customer Service line to gain information on who to speak to about the ATM cameras at Wawa. The representative was no help and stated I had to wait for Hill-McKinneys fraud case through the banks investigative team to be resolved first before they would give any information regarding the transaction. I asked if they would be able to tell me if the case was still pending through PNC if I gave the case number, to which the representative said No, we cant do that.  The representative stated the ATMs at the Wawa location do have cameras installed in them, but that does not mean the bank will willingly give access to them. I asked if they could provide a number for someone who would be able to give me that information, and again I was told No.  I emailed Hill-McKinney asking if she has any further information from PNC Bank, I have not heard back from her yet.    </NarrativeText>
