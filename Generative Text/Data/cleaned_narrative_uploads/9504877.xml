         <NarrativeText>I-62 equipped with an in-car camera system. This interaction was not captured on In-Car camera. This interaction was captured on body camera.  Scene Processing: No scene processing was required for this case. Both subjects involved in the verbal altercation were interviewed.  Physical Evidence: No physical evidence was obtained in this case.  Involved subject: Myara Amelia Rookard (U/F, DOB: 06/26/1989)  Involved subject: Shannon Marie Febles (W/F, DOB: 06/21/1981)  Narrative:   On September 09, 2023, at approximately 2235 hours, I (TFC. Milich #6493) was dispatched to a residence located at 4302 Grouse Circle, Hurlock, Dorchester County, Maryland, for the report of a possible domestic dispute between two females.   I arrived on scene at approximately 2245 hours and made contact with a juvenile female in the front yard of the residence who stated that her mother (Myara Rookard) got into a verbal argument with her girlfriend and they were intoxicated.   I walked up to the front door and made contact with a subject who later identified herself as, Shannon Marie Febles (W/F, DOB: 06/21/1981). Febles tried telling me what the issue was, but was repeatedly interrupted by her girlfriend, that was later identified as, Myara Rookard (U/F, DOB: 06/26/1989). Rookard continued to say fuck you and did not allow Febles to speak with me, interrupting her on multiple occasions. I advised Rookard if she did not wish to speak to me she can separate herself from the conversation. Rookard continued to say Fuck you. I requested Febles to walk away from the residence with me into the front yard, separated from Rookard. She complied and began telling me her side of the story. Febles stated that her and Rookard got into an argument so Febles threw an alcoholic beverage at Rookard and Rookard brushed her shoulder into Febles. The two continued arguing. Rookard, again interjected herself into our conversation, cursing and threating if we put hands on her there will be a problem. At this time, I placed Rookard into custody to detain her because she refused to comply with my orders to stop walking up to me and hindering my investigation. Febles stated that her two small juvenile children with in the residence, along with Rookards Juvenile daughter while the two were arguing. Febeles stated that she was from New York and did not have anywhere local to go to for the night and refused to leave the residence without all of her belonging. She stated that her and Rookard were in an intimate relationship together. Febeles advised that she has established residency at this address for almost a month.   I spoke with Rookard after she was able to calm down. Rookard agreed with the statements provided by Febles. Rookard initially refused to separate from the residence for the remainder of the evening, however two neighbors arrived on scene and were able to talk with Rookard. Rookard was released from detention/ handcuffs after calming down. After speaking with Rookard, she agreed to separate from Febles for the remainder of the evening at the neighbors residence.   Both Febeles and Rookard were referred to the District Court Commissioners office for peace/ protective orders.    Case closed. No follow up investigation needed at this time.  All events occurred in Dorchester County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
