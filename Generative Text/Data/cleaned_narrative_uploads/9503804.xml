TFC Tenorio requested I get the information from the driver in the silver Infiniti G35 bearing Maryland registration 5EV0649. I made contact with the driver and introduced myself. I asked the driver for his license and registration. The driver advised he did not have his license and identified himself as Jordan Uhn Suh Park, A/M, DOB: 02/25/2005. I positively identified the driver as Park by his Motor Vehicle Administration photograph. A routine METERS/NCIC check of Park revealing his license was suspended. Due to Park being a minor, 17 year of age at the time of the incident, a Juvenile Release Form was completed. A tow truck was requested for the vehicle Park was driving, Taubers Towing responded to the scene. I advised Park he needed to contact his parents and have them respond to the scene. Park was unable to make contact with his parents. Park advised his parents were separated and they had rented a house for him to live in at 8867 Roll Right Court, Columbia, Howard County, Maryland. Park said his mom lived at a different address, but he was not sure what the address was. Park said his father had two different houses that he resided at, but what unsure of which address his father was at.

I relayed Park to the Fairway Avenue and spoke with his grandfather and advised of what had occurred. His grandfather said he did not want to take custody of Park and provided me with his fathers address, 7312 Johnnycake Road, Catonsville, Baltimore County, Maryland. I then relayed Park to his fathers address and Spoke with his father, Johnathan Park.

         <NarrativeText>On Wednesday, January 25th, 2023 at approximately 0058hours, I was in the area of W Nursey Rd and MD-295 Linthicum, Anne Arundel County, Md, assisting Tfc Frye with a traffic stop. While with Tfc Frye, I heard loud revving engines and wheels spinning near by. I advised Tfc Frye, I would check behind the Royal Farms. As I made my way behind the Royal Farms in the area of Pinnacle Dr another vehicle was heading directly toward me. The suspect vehicle was a 2003 Infiniti G35 bearing Maryland registration 5EV0649. I activated my emergency equipment and advised the driver to stop. The driver advised it wasnt him and it was the other two cars behind him. At the time I made contact with the driver, two other vehicles were still spinning tires and revving engines. As I continued my conversation with the driver the other two vehicles made their way towards us. I began collecting vehicles and driver information when Tfc Frye arrived on scene to assist. Tfc Frye obtained the information of the driver I was originally out with. The driver was identified as Jordan Uhn Suh Park A/M D.O.B 02/25/2005. It was later revealed Park was suspended and Tfc Frye made a juvenile arrest. All events occurred in Anne Arundel County.</NarrativeText>
