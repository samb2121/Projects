         <NarrativeText>On July 28, 2023, at approximately 0600 hours, I was contacted by a family member, who advised that Helen Ridenour (11/09/1987), a cousin of mine, has recently suffered mental status changes due to complications of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The concerned family member advised that Helen drove from her residence, and it was unknown where she was at. Helen had been recently talking as if she was Median, who talks to dead people. Helen had been transported to UPMC Western Maryland Hospital in the prior days for mental status changes, however refused treatment and was not Emergency Petitioned. It should be noted, her husband, Christopher Ridenour had sent their children to stay with her brother Gary based on her mental state of mind.  After learning of the aforementioned circumstances, I contacted the MSP Cumberland Barrack to broadcast a lookout for her vehicle and was attempting a GPS ping on her cellular phone. During this time, a family member contacted me again and advised that Helen was located, parked in a field behind 10314 Mertens Ave, Oldtown, MD. It should be noted, this residence is Helens great aunts house and my grandmothers.  Upon arriving at 10314 Mertens Ave, I contacted Helen and observed her talking to herself and stating she was waiting on other family members she had spoken with on the phone. I asked Helen to exit the vehicle and she did, but stated she wasnt going to harm anyone. I spoke with Helen for a period of time, and she expressed emotional feelings of missing her father, who had passed away approximately 22 years prior. While speaking, Helen stated she speaks with dead people and stated she was a median. During this time, I could see different facial expressions change on Helens face, as if she was wondering what was happening as she looked around and got quiet. It should be noted, I am familiar with Helen as a family member who has been around her since she was a child and could tell she was not her normal self.  While speaking with and observing Helens behavior, her mother, Anita Whorton, arrived and advised that Helen hadnt been taking her MS medicine due to costs and changes with medical insurance. Anita stated that since she stopped talking the medications, she has begun this behavior and believes the MS has caused further brain damage as a result. It should be noted, MS has been known to cause brain damage and other medical issues with the human body.  Based on the aforementioned circumstance, an Ambulance was requested for Helen, for purposes of Emergency Petition due to the belief that Helen may try to jump from a moving vehicle if transported in that manner.As the Ambulance arrived, Helen began shouting as she ran through the grass away from the Ambulance. Family members were able to gently restrain her as Ambulance personnel administered medicine to help her relax. Helen was then placed in the ambulance and transported to UPMC Western Maryland Hospital.  Upon arriving at the Hospital, medics on the ambulance advised that Helen had to be restrained as she attempted to exit the ambulance during transport, before being further sedated.  After speaking with medics, I completed the Emergency Petition Paperwork and Helen was committed for treatment.  All the above events occurred in Allegany County, MD.  Case closed.                     </NarrativeText>
