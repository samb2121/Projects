Socks #6504   Maryland State Police   Hagerstown Barrack 90-64  Assisting Trooper:   S/TPR Bussard #5921 Maryland State Police   Hagerstown Barrack 90-64  Suspect:   William Allen Johnson Jr, W/M, 11/21/1992 (MD SDX J525887051891)   14821 Orchard Ridge Road, Hancock, MD, 21750   (Extremely cooperative during the entire event)  Suspect Vehicle:   2006 dark blue Subaru Impreza   MD Registration 9EK7056   VIN# JF1GD67656H507363  Victim(s):   None.  Witnesses:   1) Audrey Ona Beltz, W/F, 08/28/1989     9692 Browns Mill Rd, Greencastle, PA, 17225     New Hancock truck-stop Burger King Employee.    2) Daniel Roy Hockenberry, W/M, 02/12/1990    9692 Browns Mill Rd P.O. Box 174, Greencastle, PA, 17225     717-690-4001     Sitting in his truck in the Burger King parking lot.  Narrative:   Initial call from Witnesses:   On February 4th, 2023 at 0458 hours, I was dispatched to the new Hancock truck-stop Burger King located at 436 E Main St, in Hancock, Maryland, for a report of a vehicle that had been stopped at theBurger King parking lotstop sign at MD-144(E Main St) for quite some time with the driver passed out behind the wheel. Daniel Hockenberry was the witness/caller who initiated our response.    Arrival on scene/Initial Contact:   When I arrived on the scene, I immediately observed a dark blue Subaru Impreza sitting at the parking lot stop sign. I made contact with Daniel Hockenberry who was sitting in his vehicle in the Burger King Parking lot. Daniel advised his wife/girlfriend, Audrey, was working the drive-thru when the vehicle came through wanting food. She advised the male driver appeared to be intoxicated.    After briefly speaking to Daniel, I pulled up to the Subaru and made contact with the driver. I activated my body-worn camera and walked up to the front passenger window. The vehicle was running and its headlights and tail lights were on. I observed the inside of the vehicle and saw the keys in the ignition and the vehicles transmission was still in drive as indicated by the position of the sifter in the center console. The driver was laid back in his seat with his head turned to his right shoulder. The driver was slobbering as if he appeared to be overdosing from some type of CDS. I then advised the barrack to start EMSfor a possible CDS overdose. I went around to the drivers door and opened it to make contact with the driver and immediately detected the very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. I attempted to wake the driver who took a minute to come to and be coherent in conversation. During the initial contact with the driver, he can be heard stating he was intoxicated by alcohol. His eyes appeared to be glassy in appearance. The driver was identified asWilliam Allen Johnson Jr by his Maryland-issued license.    Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTS)   After making contact with Johnson Jr, detecting the very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, and Johnson Jr himself advising he was intoxicated, I asked him if he wanted to perform the Standardized Field Sobriety Test to which he politely refused. Due to the extremely freezing temperatures, Johnson Jr was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle to finish the paperwork. Due to being extremely cooperative, I backed his car into a parking space in the Burger King parking lot for him to pick up at a later time.    DR-15 Advice of Rights:   After backing his vehicle into a parking space, I played the DR-15 in English from my in-car computer directly from the MVA Law Enforcement Website. Johnson Jr was given a paper copy of the DR-15 to follow along. At the completion of the DR-15 audio, Johnson Jr politely refused to sign the DR-15 at 0540 hours. While Johnson was sitting in my vehicle, I could smell the very strong odor of alcohol being emitted from his breath.    DR-15A Order of Suspension:   After refusing to sign the DR-15, I completed the DR-15A. I asked if he wanted to sign his portion of the DR-15A and again he politely refused to sign the DR-15A. Johnson Jrs license was confiscated and the DR-15A was issued.    Citations issued:   Johnson was issued the appropriate DUI-related citations, given his copies of all paperwork, and I transported him to his residence.    Hagerstown Barrack Intoximeter:   SGT brown completed the refusal process on the intoximeter and the Intoximeter test refusal slip was placed in the DUI file. The equipment was in working order at the time of refusal.  All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland.  Case Status:   Case closed by arrest.    </NarrativeText>
