         <NarrativeText>INCIDENT RECORDED AND SAVED UNDER ID 23MSP004740  On February 6th, 2023 at approximately 2234 hours, I was dispatched to the area of Ocean Gateway and Buck Bryan Road, located in Trappe, Talbot County, Maryland, for a check the welfare. The information provided was a male subject attempted to drive to the Cambridge Hospital and was unable to locate the hospital. The male subject stated he pulled over in the area of Tammys Cool things. I arrived in the area and located the vehicle in the Shore Stop parking lot. I was able to make contact with the male subject who was identified as Harry Stevens Clark (09/07/1953 2/M). Harry Clark stated he wanted to check himself into the Cambridge ER to be evaluated. Harry Clark further told me he was unsure where the hospital was. Harry Clark then told me that he was a mental patient and used to be prescribed Colonapin. Harry Clark told me that he had been duck hunting earlier in the day and his friend shot his dog, but he believed that it was an accident. Harry Clark continued to state that he was a mental patient. I asked Harry Clark if he had any thoughts of harming himself and Harry Clark stated he had been thinking about it all day. I asked Harry Clark how he was thinking of hurting himself and Harry Clark stated he was going to pull the trigger and end it all. Based on Harry Clarks statement, I took Harry Clark into custody and transported him to the Cambridge ER for an emergency petition. Harry Clark was released to the custody of the hospital.  I then responded to 31410 Miller Road located in Cordova, Talbot County, Maryland and made contact with Linda Clark. I explained to Linda Clark what was going on, and Linda Clark stated that Harry Clark did not go hunting. Linda Clark also advised that the dog that Harry Clark stated had been shot, was not shot and was okay. Linda Clark stated that Harry Clarks behavior had been unpredictable recently and that Harry Clark gone into two separate arguments with their neighbor and one of the arguments, Harry Clark alleged that the neighbor pulled a firearm. I asked Linda Clark if there were any firearms in the residence that Harry Clark had acces to and Linda Clark stated the only firearm was a .22 Pistol which Harry Clark did not have access to. Linda Clark stated that Harry Clark had been spending more time in his workshop, but she was unsure if he had any firearms in the workshop. Linda Clark also advised that Harry Clark used to abuse alcohol but that he had quit drinking for about 34 years, Linda Clark stated that last year, Harry Clark had started to drink alcohol again, but then he quit drinking again, and she was unsure if he had started drinking again. Linda Clark took me to the workshop to verify there were no firearms. I observed the dog which Clark stated had been shot and observed the dog did not have any injuries. I also observed a 5 gallon bucket that had empty beer cans inside. I checked the workshop and did not locate any firearms. Linda Clark advised Harry Clark was prescribed prescriptions but she ws unsure if Harry Clark was taken the medication a prescribed.  All events occurred in Talbot and Dorchester Counties  Case Closed </NarrativeText>
