         <NarrativeText>On October 4, 2023, at approximately 2000 hours, I responded to the area of the I/L I-695 near Loch Raven Blvd, for a motor vehicle collision.  Upon my arrival, I observed an unoccupied silver, Ford Fusion bearing Ohio registration JDD7058 with damage to its from passenger wheel and corner panel. The Ford was disabled in lane 3. The second vehicle involved was a blue, Toyota Corolla bearing Maryland registration 3DM8345. The operator of the Toyota was identified by his Maryland drivers license asChristopher Michael Battaglia (2/M, DOB 2/2/1966). When asked, Battaglia stated that he was traveling in lane 2 and the Ford unsafely changed from lane 1 into lane 2 and struck his vehicle. As Battaglia safely pulled onto the right shoulder, the unidentified operator of the Ford approached and confronted Battaglia before fleeing the scene on foot. The operator of the Ford never exchanged information with Battaglia before fleeing the scene. A tow truck was requested to the scene due to both vehicles sustaining damages causing them to become disabled. Once both vehicles were removed by the tow company, Senior Trooper Boblitz and I searched the area in search of the operator of the Ford but our search was unsuccessful.  A late hit confirmation on the Ford revealed that it was reported stolen to the Baltimore County Police Department on this same date. According to the hit notification, the suspect took the victims keys and left in vehicle without her permission.  On October 25, 2023, I contacted the owner of the Ford via telephone. The registered owner was identified as Alexandra Svesko. When asked, Svesko stated that the Ford was not insured at the time of the collision. She stated that the suspect was someone she previously dated. He became upset when she decided to end their relationship so he took her vehicle keys and vehicle without her permission. When asked, Svesko advised she only knew the suspect as Michael and could not provide any additional information. Svesko was instructed to contact me in the event that she discovered any identifyable information of the suspect. Svesko was provided with a case number for the accident report.  At this time, I respectfully request this case be closed due to lack of suspect information.  All events occurred in Baltimore County, MD.</NarrativeText>
