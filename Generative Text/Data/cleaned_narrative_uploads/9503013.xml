         <NarrativeText>  On 1/26/2023 I was dispatched to respond to the Sleep Inn located at 18216 Col H k Douglas Dr, Hagerstown, MD 21740 for a reported theft of a motor vehicle. Upon making contact with the complainant he advised that a motor vehicle he was in possession of had been stolen from the parking lot. That vehicle was identified as a gray Honda Civic bearing NC registration KDJ6834. The vehicle was initially entered into NCIC as stolen and a case number of 23-MSP-003232 was issued. Shortly after entering the vehicle into NCIC the Washington County Sheriffs Office contacted the barrack and advised that they had possession of the vehicle and that it was involved in a motor vehicle collision the previous night. There were multiple people who had access to the vehicle, and it was determined that the vehicle was never actually stolen. The registered owner of the vehicle was provided with the information regarding the vehicle, and it was removed from NCIC. Due to the report being issued in error it was also deleted and subsequently re-issued under this case number for compliance purposes.  All events occurred in Washington County, MD  Case Status: Closed  </NarrativeText>
