         <NarrativeText>CAR B41 // IN-CAR CAMERA AVAILABLE / BODY CAMERA AVAILABLE  Attachments: MSP Form 30 (Notice not to Trespass) MSP Form 53 (Juvenile Release Form)  Victim/Complainant Victim: Wawa (5833 Ballenger Creek Pike) (301)668-1502  Complainant: Dallana Flores (Manager at Wawa) Ms. Flores contacted the Frederick Barrack because the suspect, Jason Elijah Lawrence, was back in the store even though a notice not trespassed had been completed on February 7, 2023, and he was not allowed to be in the store.  Witness/Neighborhood Check None  Suspect: Jason Elijah Lawrence (DOB: 12/13/2008, B/M)  Scene Processing: Talked to the manager, Dallana Flores, and obtained a copy of the MSP Form 30 (Notice not to Trespass).  Narrative: On June 3, 2023, at approximately 1917 hours, I, TFC Oyola of the Maryland State Police Frederick barrack, responded to the Wawa on 5833 Ballenger Creek Pike for a complaint of a subject that was trespassing. Upon arrival, as I was about to walk inside the Wawa, one of the employees directed my attention towards a subject that had walked past me. The employee, later identified as supervisor Dallana Flores, advised that the subject that had walked past me was previously trespassed from the store and was not allowed in the property. I made contact with the subject, later identified as Jason Elijah Lawrence. I asked Lawrence if he was aware that he was trespassed and was not allowed in the store, and he advised he was not aware. I asked if police or Wawa employees have talked to him before about not being allowed in the store, and he said they talked to him a few months back. Flores then provided a copy of the no trespass notice that was completed back on February 7, 2023, by TFC Rickard against Jason Elijah Lawrence, under case # 23-MSP-004815. This was also confirmed by the Frederick Barrack. I told Lawrence that since he was trespassed, he was not allowed in the store. At that time, I transported Lawrence to his residence at 603 Village Grove Drive #208. There, I spoke with Lawrences mother, Francesca Leona Mboua. Mboua was aware of the no trespass order against her son. I told Mboua that since the order was still in effect, Lawrence was trespassing. I charged Lawrence for the crime of trespassing at the Wawa and completed an MSP Form 53 Juvenile Release Form. Mboua signed the paperwork, and Lawrence was released to her custody at approximately 1945 hours.  Lawrence was charged under CR 6-403: TRESPASS: PRIVATE PROPERTY  Flores later stated that since the day Lawrence was trespassed, he has been back to the store multiple times despite Flores telling him that he is not allowed.  All the above events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.  </NarrativeText>
