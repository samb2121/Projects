         <NarrativeText>Attachments -NCMEC Cybertip #153490489 -Victims Linktree account -Suspects Neustar search -Screenshot of the Facebook message from Annalise -Maryland State Police Consent to Search and Seize (Form 78) -Maryland State Police Chain of Custody (Form 67)  Narrative On January 26, 2023, the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Section /Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force received NCMEC CyberTip #153490489. The CyberTip, generated by the complainant/victim, Daina Coley, that the suspect manipulated her from the time she was 13 to now, 18. The CyberTip was assigned to TFC Burnett for investigation.   The CyberTip provided the following information pertaining to the reported subjects:  Victim:  Relationship to Reporter: Its me, and I am no longer a child Name: Daina Coley Address: 4325 Dunn Rd Huntingtown, MD 20639 US Mobile Phone: (443) 771-0225 Date of Birth: 01-27-1999 Email Address: michaeldaina@gmail.com Profile URL: https://linktr.ee/Casimer Additional Information: this took place over more than just IMVU, but also over text messages, on my phone number and over messaging apps.  Suspect: Relationship to Reporter: Online friend Name: Annalise Shepherd Mobile Phone: (901) 303-4118 Date of Birth: 01-23-1997 Email Address: anna_shepherd@live.com Profile URL: annaliseblanche on redbubble and RosenB1anche on youtube, those are the only ones I know of now Additional Information: I used to have her old address but she moved   TFC Burnett reviewed this CyberTip and observed the reporting persons concern below:  This makes me really nervous. Recently I was going through text messages and gathering screen shots and it just makes me sick to know how ignorant I was as a kid. I feel scared, honestly. But I think it would be right to try to report this, and do something, rather than run away from it- because the reality is that it affected me deeply.  TFC Burnett conducted a police search and located the below information:  Victim: Daina Catherine Coley (W/F, DOB: 1/27/1999) Suspect: Annalise Blanche Shepherd (DOB: 1/23/1996), 933 Harbor View Dr, Memphis TN  On 1/26/2023 and 1/30/2023, TFC Burnett attempted to make contact with Daina by phone with no answer, a voicemail was left each time.  An attempt to make contact with Daina in person will be scheduled.   On 2/2/2023, I was made contact with Daina by phone and scheduled for 2/3/2023 to meet.  On 2/3/2023, at approximately 0735 hours, Sgt. Pitcher and I made contact with Daina at 4325 Dunn Rd, Huntingtown, MD. Daina explained that she was going through her old phone and located old conversations between she (14 yoa) and her ex-girlfriend, Annalise (17 yoa) at the time who lived in Arizona. Daina advised that she realized the conversations for her age at the time were inappropriate and she wanted to report it, to make sure no one else was being enticed by her.   Daina explained she met in Annalise in January of 2014 through a chatting site (IMVU), Annalise commented on Dainas character (avatar). Daina explained that Annalise and her started dating, but never saw each other in real life. Annalise was described as controlling and Daina quickly became isolated from others because she did not want Annalise to be mad at her. Daina advised that Annalise would tell her to act more mature for her age (14). In the spring of 2017, Annalise wanted Daina to come see her, but Daina was not able to go by herself. But Dainas mother said that it would be okay for Annalise to visit them, which did not happen. Daina explained during the fall of 2019, Annalise was overwhelmingly bugging her and Daina wanted a break, which Annalise was not happy about. Daina stopped talking to Annalise and blocked her at this point. Daina advised July 3, 2020, Annalise sent Daina a long message on Facebook messenger, but she did not respond.   Daina allowed me to take her old phone to go through the messages between her and Annalise by signing the Maryland State Police Consent to Search and Seize (Form 78).  Dainas white Galaxy S5 with the charger was seized and transported to the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit temporary storage until I can review the content.  I was able to review Dainas text messages between her and Annalise. The very first message that is still in the phone was from around the October 12, 2015. I did not locate messages from when they started talking. The only thing that I located was some text messages about when they met and their ages. I did not locate anything that was concerning such as Annalise asking for inappropriate images/videos of Annalise, or her sending anything. The conversations appeared to be normal conversations. Below are some conversations: Unknown Date: But in 2015  Daina: I really wish I knew the exact day I met you Annalise: Honestly, trying to think back to the very first time I found you on IMVU, Im pretty sure it was February or March of 2013. Annalise: But I do not know the day. Annalise: Late February to mid March. Daina: Its still crazy to me how much I changed through that year. Annalise: you were very young then, especially compared to now. Daina: Feels like its been more than like 2 years. Daina: Lol Daina: 3 soon Annalise: Thats the way she goes Daina: The beginning is a blur  10/16/2015, 5:56 PM  Annalise: Hes old and so am I. Daina: Same Annalise: U r not Daina: I feel like it Annalise: I will be 20 Daina: I will be 17 Annalise: Am older. Old. The retirement home is ready for me. Daina: Ive been in the retirement home since I was 10. Annalise: I call bs on that one.  Based on the lack of information, there is no evidence that would be chargeable by Maryland law.  On 3/3/2023, I returned Dainas Samsung phone to her residence, she was unavailable at the time, which her father, Danny Coley signed for her phone.  Case Status Case closed </NarrativeText>
