Narrative:  This report has been prepared based upon the observations of this trooper and/or those of other troopers relative to the offense(s). The facts contained herein are intended solely to give the prosecuting authority a basic understanding of the facts pertaining to this case. The facts contained herein are not intended to be an exhaustive recitation of the facts pertaining to pretrial or trial issues. Instead, this trooper anticipates that during the pretrial proceedings in this case, the prosecutor will take the opportunity to interview this trooper in order to ascertain any and all relevant facts which might be the subject of this troopers testimony during court proceedings.  Phase #1 - Vehicle in Motion: On the evening of March 11th, 2023, I was on proactive patrol along MD Route 822 in Princess Anne, Somerset County, Maryland. At approximately 2020 hours, I was traveling westbound on MD Route 822 when I observed a black Acura Sedan following me closer than reasonable. The Acura less than a half of a car length behind me, close enough that I could not see the headlights on the vehicle. As soon as I left the roundabout and started heading north on Somerset Avenue, the Acura continued to follow me at an unreasonable distance. As we approached MD Route 529, I pull off to let the Acura pass. As soon as it did, I performed a traffic stop on the vehicle. I was able to identify the license plate as 1EF4856, through the State of Maryland. The final location of the traffic stop was Somerset Avenue at MD Route 529. I never lost sight of this vehicle during the observation process.  Phase #2 - Personal Contact: I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the drivers door where I contactedthe operator, later identified as William Tarpeh (DOB: 7/11/1992) via his Maryland Drivers License. I introduced myself, stated the reason for the traffic stop, and advised him that he was being audibly and visually recorded.I immediately detected a moderate but distinct odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the drivers compartment of the vehicle. I observed Tarpehs eyes to be bloodshot and glassy. See the attached image IMG_0000 for a depiction of Tarpehs eyes.  I asked Tarpeh for his license and registration. As he was grabbing his information, I asked him where he was coming from. Tarpeh replied UMES before handing me his Drivers License. I asked Tarpeh how much he had to drink that night. He stated I aint really had too much to drink. Tarpeh also advised he was coming from a sorority reunion.  Phase #3 - Pre-Arrest Screening: I asked Tarpeh to exit the vehicle, and he did as I asked. As he exited the drivers seat, I observed him to be wearing black dress shoes, gray dress pants, and a white collared shirt with a striped tie. His movements exiting the vehicle were very slow and lethargic. I asked Tarpeh to stand at the front of his vehicle while I asked him a few questions. While he walked to the front of the car, Tarpeh could barely walk straight. As I spoke with Tarpeh outside the vehicle, I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person.  Based on Tarpehs driving that I observed and his admission to drinking paired with the odor of alcohol, he was offered field sobriety testing as a means to determine his level of impairment. He agreed to participate in the field sobriety testing. I began the testing with the Alphabet F to T test.  Alphabet F to T  I asked Tarpeh if he knew the English Alphabet, and he advised that he did. I asked Tarpeh to recite the English Alphabet from the letter F to T without singing it. Tarpeh said: F, G, H, I, A, B, C, D, E hold on. Then he paused. He resumed at F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T. Tarpeh did the following: - Skipped the letter Q  Count From 59 to 31  I asked Tarpeh to count backwards starting at 59 and ending at 31. Tarpeh did the following: - Skipped number 50 - Skipped number 33 - Stopped at number 30  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus  Starting off the introduction to the standardized tests, I asked Tarpeh if he wore glasses or contacts or was prescribed to be wearing them, and he stated No. I also asked Tarpeh if he had taken or is prescribed any medication. He advised No. I asked Tarpeh if he had suffered any traumatic head injuries recently, and he advised that he had not.  I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Tarpeh. I instructed him to stand still with his feet together, hands down by his side, and to follow the stimulus (my pen) with his eyes and eyes only, keeping his head straight.He advisedthat he understood and could see the stimulus clearly, so I began the test.  Resting Nystagmus: No Equal Tracking: Yes Equal Pupil Size: Yes Eye Color: Brown  - Lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes - Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes - Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes  Note: Failed to track with his eyes multiple times, following with head and sometimes just staring straight at me.  Total Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Clues6of6  Walk and Turn  Weather:Clear Surface:Flat paved surface free of any debris/used imaginary straight line  I explained and demonstrated the Walk and Turn test to Tarpeh. He was instructed to assume the starting position by placing his left foot on the imaginaryline and his right foot directly in front, heel touching toe, and to maintain this position while I explained the test. He was also instructed not to start or stop the test until instructed to do so.  He was advised totake nine heel-to-toe steps along the imaginaryline while looking down at his feet and counting each step out loud. Once he reached nine steps, he was instructed to leave his lead foot planted and take a series of small steps to turn himself around, then take nine more heel-to-toe steps back along thatline.During the test, he was also instructed to keep his hands down by his side. I asked Tarpeh if he had questions, and he stated he did not.  I asked Tarpeh if he was comfortable performing this test in the shoes he was wearing now, and he stated Yes.  While explaining and demonstrating, I observed Tarpeh to lose his balance, break the heel-to-toe position immediately, and stand normally, contrary to my instruction.  Instruction Stage - Cannot keep balance in starting position - Starts too soon  Walking Stage 1st 9 Steps - Stops walking on 9th step - Stopped test for an entire minute trying to remember how to turn around - Took9steps total  Turn - Lost balance while turning and pivoted once on lead foot.  Walking Stage 2nd 9 Steps - Misses heel to toe on 2ndstep - Stepped off the line by approximately 3 inches on 1st step - Took 9 steps total  Total Walk and Turn Clues6of8  One Leg Stand  Weather:Same as Above Surface:Same as Above  I explained and demonstrated the One Leg Stand test to Tarpeh. He was instructed to lift one foot of his choice about six inches off of the ground, look down at his raisedfoot, and count out loud by the method given -one-thousand one, one-thousand two, one-thousand-three, etc. He was also advised to keep his hands down to his side and to not stop counting nor stop the test until he is instructedto do so. I asked Tarpeh if he understood the test, and he advised me that he did.Tarpeh then began the test by lifting hisleftfoot from the ground.  Seconds 0-10 - Sways from side to side approximately 4 inches  Seconds 11-20 - Sways from side to side approximately 4 inches  Seconds 21-30 - Sways from side to side approximately 4 inches  Ended test at 30 seconds  Total One Leg Stand Clues1of4  Preliminary Breath Test  I explained the reasons for using apreliminarybreath test and Tarpeh wasoffered the opportunity to submit abreath sample.Tarpeh agreed and submitted a breath sample of .027 BrAC. Due to level of alcohol showing inconsistent to the impairment I observed, I notified the barrack to call a DRE.  Arrest and Transport  At 2045 hours, I placed Tarpeh under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Tarpeh was placed into the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle. Back at the barrack, I performed a secondary search and checked Tarpeh s mouth for foreign objects. I did not locate any foreign objects. I then pulled up a copy of the DR-15 Advice of Rights, sat it in front of Tarpeh, and asked if he could see the form. Tarpeh advised that he could, and I played the DR-15 audio directly from the MVA website, having Tarpeh follow along. After the reading was complete, Tarpeh stated that he would like to submit a breath sample.  Breath Test  Sgt. White, a certified Intoximeter operator, arrived and contacted Tarpeh. At 2130 hours, Sgt. White administered the Intoximeter Test with a result of .000 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  DRE Evaluation  Blood Sample  At 2206 hours, Tpr. Romeo, a certified Drug Recognition Expert, responded to the Princess Anne barrack to conduct an evaluation on Tarpeh. MSP HQ advised that nobody was available and the barrack struggled to obtain a local DRE after the original officer called out became busy. Tpr. Romeo concluded that everything appeared normal at the time, but due to the fact that she conducted the assessment over two hours from my initial contact, Tarpeh had already out measured the half-life of most drugs.  Charging  Tarpeh was charged with the following:    DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL/DRUGS  DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE SO FAR IMPAIRED BY DRUGS/ALCOHOL  FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY  RECKLESS DRIVING VEHICLE IN WANTON AND WILLFUL DISREGARD FOR SAFETY OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY  NEGLIGENT DRIVING VEHICLE IN CARELESS AND IMPRUDENT MANNER ENDANGERING PROPERTY, LIFE AND PERSON  Tarpeh was given all appropriate documentation and released to a sober friend, Tyere Louis Ferguson (DOB: 5/17/1989) at 0015 hours without incident.  All events did occur in Somerset County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
