         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>This incident was audibly and visually recorded on my Axon body worn camera.  Physical Evidence:       (6) Photos taken of both parties       (2) Photos of vehicle       (1) Criminal Summons       (1) Maryland State Police Form 246  Narrative:       On April 29, 2023, at approximately 1956 hours, I was on uniformed patrol in my Maryland State Police Unit, U-40. I responded to 2916 Jalaber Lane, Huntingtown, MD, for a verbal domestic dispute, along with Tfc. Marsch #6850 and Tpr. Quinn #7583.        Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant/suspect, Michael Patrick Halwick Jr. (W/M DOB: 09/08/1966). Michael advised me that he and his wife, Michelly Burigo Halwick (W/F DOB: 09/15/1978), had a verbal domestic the Sunday prior on April 23, 2023. Michael stated that he believed Michelly scratched and damaged the fender of his purple 1968 Camaro sitting in their garage. The car appeared to be in good condition with a small and barely visible scratch near the front fender of the vehicle. Michael stated that the Camaro was not damaged prior to their verbal dispute on April 23. Michael had no physical proof of Michelly damaging his vehicle. Michael advised that he and Michelly have had many verbal and physical disputes over the past two years.        I went inside the residence to speak with Michelly. Michelly stated that she never touched his car and advised the only reason he was making that statement was to receive insurance for his vehicle. Michelly advised me that on Monday, April 24, 2023, she and Michael had a verbal dispute which turned physical. Michelly showed me pictures of injuries to her face and still had visible bruises on her left arm. Michelly stated that Michael grabbed her and punched her neck, left arm, and both thighs. Michelly had no visible injuries to her face or neck at the time. I did not observe any injuries to Michellys legs as she stated they were on her inner thighs, and she was wearing pants at the time. I observed visible bruising on Michellys left arm. Michellys injuries were consistent with her story, so I took photos of the injuries to her arms and uploaded them to RMS. I asked Michelly why she did not call the cops when Micheal was physically abusing her. Michelly stated that she is from Portugal and is very unfamiliar with how the American criminal justice system works.        I spoke to Michellys two daughters, and they advised they were physically okay, however, they were upset because Michael verbally and physically assaults Michelly. I advised Michelly to call 911 immediately if Michael ever physically assaults her. I also advised Michellys two daughters to call 911 that if they ever see Michelly and Michael physically fighting. I did not observe any visible injuries on the two daughters. The kids did not advise if they saw Michael physically abuse Michelly on April 24, however, both daughters stated they constantly observe Michael physically assaulting Michelly.        Both parties were provided with a peace and protective order brochure along with the case number. Both parties were advised to go to the commissioner and apply for a protection order as well as to stay separated for the night.        Due to the statements made by Michelly as well as the evidence of injury, I completed an application of charges and presented it to the commissioner. The commissioner granted the request and provided me with a criminal summons. The summons was served on May 1, 2023, at approximately 2239 hours.        Michael is being charged with the following:  CR 3-203 ASSAULT-SEC DEGREE  On May 22, 2023, I made contact with Michelly and assisted her with completing a Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Form. Michelly advised me that after she was assaulted on April 24, 2023, she met with Court Advocate Colleen regarding the incident. Michelly advised me that she sent Colleen photographs of injuries she had received from Michael. Colleen assisted Michelly with applying for a protection order. Michelly received a final protection order against Michael on May 9, 2023. Michelly advised me that she has not had contact with Michael since receiving the protection order. Michelly had no apparent injures at this time.  Case closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Calvert County, MD.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>Narrative:   On 5-26-2023 I called Michelly Halwick in regard to this incident, but there was no answer. I was unable to leave a voicemail because it was not set up.    On 6-2-2023, I called Halwick and was able to speak with her. Halwick advised that she does have a protective order in place and that she has been working with the court and has sent updated pictures of her injuries to the victim/witness coordinator. When asked if she needed any resources or counselors, she advised that she has spoken with a counselor as well and seems to be in constant communication with the counselor. Lastly, we talked about her safety plan.   This concludes my part of the investigation.</NarrativeText>
