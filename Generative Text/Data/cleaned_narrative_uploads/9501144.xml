         <NarrativeText>  On 10/15/2023 at 0236 hours, I, Trooper ODonald, responded to 12747 Old Bridge Road, Ocean City, Maryland 21842 in reference to a domestic assault. Upon my arrival, I made contact with the complainant, an employee of Diakonia Inc. The employee informed me that the residents of apartment 5 had an argument and he believed that it turned physical. He advised that the male party was passed out on the couch in the apartment. The employee directed me to apartment 5. Upon my entry, I immediately observed a male passed out on the couch. I observed a femal standing in the back of the room away from the male subject. I made contact with the female and identified her by her Maryland Drivers License as Summer Brooke Timmons (DOB: 08/09/1993). Timmons advised me that the male subject on the couch was her boyfriend, identified as Darrin Lee Church (DOB: 09/14/1990). Timmons stated that she lives in the apartment in Diakonia with Church and their six children. Timmons stated that she got off work at approximately 2330 hours on 10/14/2023. At that time, she received a phone call from Church who was angry at the employees at Diakonia. Timmons advised that Church became angry when Diaknoia employees entered the apartment during their daily premises check. Timmons stated that upon her arrival home from work, Church was intoxicated and began arguing with her. Timmons stated that the argument turned physical and Church grabbed her hair and pulled it so that she flipped over the couch. Timmons stated that Church then reached over the back of the couch and began choking her. Timmons could not remember if it was with one hand or two hands. Timmons stated that Church stopped choking her and struck the right side of her face. Timmons advised that Church was so intoxicated that he was unable to continue assaulting her and sat down on the couch. Timmons said that Church continued arguing with her for a short time before he passed out on the couch. Timmons and their oldest child attempted to get Church into his bed after he passed out, however he would get up and lay back down on the couch. Timmons advised that she left him there until he passed out again. Timmons called the employees at Diakonia shortly after Church passed out, and the employees called the police. Timmons stated that Church has threatened to assault her in the past but this was the first time Church actually assaulted her.    While speaking with Timmons, I observed that her left ear was red and swollen in the area that she advised she was struck. I observed that her left eye appeared to be bruised. I observed red marks on her neck, however Timmons stated that the marks were not from being strangled. The MSP Form 246 was completed, however Timmons declined to speak with a counselor. Timmons additionally stated that she would not pursue a protective order against Church. Timmons injuries were photographed.    I then made contact with Church. Church was still unconscious at the time. It took me several minutes to wake Church up due to his level of intoxication. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his person. I observed that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy. While Church was waking up, his speech was slurred and incomprehensible. Churchs movements were uncoordinated and he was unable to remain sitting up. Based off the following, I placed Church under arrest at 0257 hours.       1) Church and Timmons live together and have children in common       2) Timmons had visible injuries to her face       3) The assault occurred just prior to the initial 911 call.    After I placed Church under arrest, he stated that he had to pee. I informed Church that he would have the opportunity to use the bathroom at a later time. However, when Church stood up, he pulled his pants partway down and began urinating on the couch he had been laying on. I had to physically support Church because he was unable to maintain his balance while he was urinating. I transported Church to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for processing. Church had his initial appearance with the District Court Commissioner over the phone. The District Court Commissioner set his bond at $3,500. Church was subsequently transported to the Worcester County Jail.    I request this case be closed by arrest.  All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
