VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1) On November 18th, 2023, at approximately 0644 hours, I, Trooper Fleming #7439 currently assigned to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, was dispatched to the area of southbound 95 at Powder Mill Road, Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland. The call for service was for a report of a black sedan off road. I was in full uniform operating a marked patrol vehicle Q-13. The incident was audibly and visually recorded on my body worn camera and Q-13s in-car camera. Upon my arrival, I identified a black Toyota Camry bearing Maryland registration 2FJ9569 with all around damage to the vehicle. The vehicle was completely off road to the right. I exited my patrol vehicle to make contact with the driver involved in the motor vehicle collision. EMS/Fireboard was on scene prior to my arrival. EMS personnel confirmed that Corea Castillo did not need or want to be transported to hospital.  PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2) I made contact with the driver of the black Toyota who I identified as Corea Castillo, Julio Cesar (5/M, DOB: 10/11/1989) via his Maryland Drivers license. I observed that there was a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on Corea Castillos breath and person. Corea Castillos eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Corea Castillos speech was slurred and mumbled.

I asked Corea Castillo what he meant by being irresponsible. Corea Castillo used google translate to say for driving drunk.  PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3) An additional police unit arrived on scene. Officer Valdes #3141 of Prince Georges County Police Department assisted in translating. I asked Corea Castillo how the accident happened. Corea Castillo stated that he was driving in the right most lane when another vehicle made him swerve to the right and run off road.
