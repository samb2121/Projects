         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on my Maryland State Police issued BWC. Q-16 front camera was operational.   HALL, SHERRITA L/ 23-MSP-041893 // 0C70YXS Defendants Name: SHERRITA LYNISE HALL Incident Number: 23-MSP-040865 DUI Folder: 23-293 Date of Offense: 11/26/2023 Officers Name  IBM: Trooper Richards 7514 Breath Tech Name  IBM: N/A Subsequent Offender: NO  Vehicle in Motion: (Phase 1): N/A   Personal Contact (Phase 2): On Sunday, November 26th, 2023, at approximately 1908 hours, I was dispatched to a collision on W/B RT 50 towards I-495. I arrived at approximately 1933 hours. Upon arrival, I observed a black Jeep bearing MD registration 6CT3498 off to the shoulder. I was advised by SHA (State Highway Administration) that this vehicle was involved in the collision by the ramp for RT 704. I made contact with the sole occupant and driver of the vehicle, SHERRITA LYNISE HALL (B/F DOB: 07/19/1990) who was verified by her Maryland drivers license. Upon making contact, I smelled the strong and distinct odor of an alcoholic beverage. I identified myself as a Maryland State Trooper and asked how this collision occurred. Hall advised that while driving she hit someone and then drove onto the shoulder. While Hall was advising on how the collision occurred, it was not making sense and her speech was low and lethargic. I asked the driver for her drivers license, registration, and proof of insurance. Hall provided her registration and said it was the insurance. Hall then scrolling on her phone looking for insurance and became distracted multiple times which prevented her from providing insurance. Hall also was unable to steadily hold her phone and dropped her cell phone. Hall speech was still lethargic. I asked Hall if she had any alcoholic beverages or any prescription medication for the day and Hall advised she has sleep apnea and took her prescription medication an hour before driving. Hall could not provide the name of the prescription nor did she have a picture of the prescription. As I continued to speak with Hall, her speech continued to be lethargic. I informed Hall that I wanted her to perform standardized field sobriety tests (SFST), to which she questioned why. I explained why I wanted to preform SFST and Hall continued to question why without making any eye contact.  Pre-Arrest Screening (Phase 3): N/A  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) 0/6 clues: Refused  Lack of Smooth Pursuit: N/A Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at Maximum deviation: N/A Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees: N/A  Walk and Turn 0/8 clues: N/A  Instruction Phase: Refused. Walking Phase (1st Nine Steps): N/A Walking Phase (2nd Nine Steps): N/A  One Leg Stand 0/4 clues: Refused  Seconds 1-10: N/A Seconds 11-20: N/A Seconds 21-30: N/A  At approximately 2101 hours, Hall refused to take the intoximeter test.  ARREST: Based on the following, I had reason to believe Hall was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs:  Hall speech was lethargic. Hall, the sole and only occupant had an alcoholic beverage emitting from their person. Hall was unable to understand directives and statements made to her.  I concluded Hall was driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2003 hours, I placed Hall under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. A search incident to arrest was conducted on Hall person by Trooper Fleming (Maryland State Police, College Park Barrack) yielding negative results. A mouth check was conducted at approximately 2014 hours which yielded negative results. Hall was placed in the front passenger seat per policy. Hall was transported to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack. While in route to the barrack, Hall was read her DR-15 Advice of Rights by audio. Hall advised numerous times she could not hear the audio, Hall was advised the audio was on max volume. While continuing to talk to Hall, I observed her speech to still be lethargic. At approximately 2101 hours, I finished reading the DR-15 Advice of Rights. Hall advised she understood what was read to her and refused to take the intoximeter test.  INTOXIMETER RESULTS  *******.00 BrAC*******  Hall was released to the care and custody of a family member.  I request this case to be closed due to an adult arrest being made.  All events occurred in Prince Georges County, Maryland. </NarrativeText>
