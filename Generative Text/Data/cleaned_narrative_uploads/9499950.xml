         <NarrativeText>  On 7/14/23 at approximately 0645 hrs, I was patrolling westbound IS 68 near Street Rd,Allegany County MD. I observed a black Honda Odyssey van bearing FL registration PXMV68. The van was traveling westbound in lane 1 at approximately 50-60 MPH in a 70 MPH zone. There were no vehicles in lane 2 and 3. I followed the van for several miles and determined that the driver was not moving from lane 1 and continued to travel at a speed that was slower than the speed limit and the normal flow of traffic. I initiated a traffic stop on the van and the driver pulled to the right shoulder of the roadway.   I approached the passenger side front window of the van and announced myself to the driver and explained that he was being recorded with audio and video equipment (body worn camera/ dash camera). I asked the white male driver, later identified by his FL DL as Ronald David Register, DOB 7/12/91, to produce his license and registration for the vehicle. I also explained that I was stopping him for his driving in the left lane at a speed slower than the speed limit and the normal flow of traffic. Register paused and I asked him if there was anything in the vehicle I needed to be concerned about. He asked me like what? and I explained firearms among other things. Register stated that he had a registered firearm. When I asked him where it was, he stated that it was in his pocket. I had Register remove the firearm from his right front shorts pocket with two fingers and place it on the dash of the van.     Upon securing the firearm, I determined that it was a Ruger LCP caliber .380, Serial Number 379054423, pistol in a black soft holster. The pistol was loaded with 6 rounds of ammunition in the magazine and 1 round in the chamber. The pistol was checked through NCIC and was determined to not have been reported stolen. Register also had a concealed carry permit issued by the state of Florida, in his wallet. Register stated that he had been traveling from Florida to New Jersey for a funeral and on this day, from New Jersey to Kentucky to visit his aunt. He stated that he was not familiar with firearm regulations in MD.      Inside the van were 3 male juveniles. Two were asleep on the rear center seat and one was asleep on the third row bench seat. A check of Registers Florida Driver License revealed that his license was suspended as of 7/5/2023 and the vehicle registration was expired as of 7/12/2023.      I placed Register under arrest for Handgun on person and Handgun in vehicle. He was transported to MSP Cumberland Barrack where he and the firearm were processed. and his vehicle was towed from the interstate. The handgun was packaged and placed into the Temporary Property Locker after being entered onto MSP Form 63 P-343159.    I then took Register before the District Court Commissioner for Allegany County, where he was released on his own recognizance. I transported Register back to MSP Cumberland Barrack to be reunited with the juveniles. Case closed by arrest. </NarrativeText>
