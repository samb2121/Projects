I responded to 28675 Hancock Drive, Mechanicsville, Saint Mary&amp;#39;s County, MD 20659 for a report of a domestic disturbance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon arrival, I made contact with Robert Allan Long Jr (W/M 06/09/1980). Long stated he had gotten into an argument with his wife and he had been trying to leave. He stated they have been married since March, but later stated they knew each other when they were eleven and were each other&amp;#39;s first boyfriend and girlfriend. He stated they hadn&amp;#39;t seen each other for thirty years. Long stated he told his wife to let him leave, and asked her why she is keeping him here. Long stated, as he was trying to leave, his wife, who was later identified as Stephenie Leigh Vinson (W/F DOB: 02/04/1981), would not get out of his car. He stated it was his car from a previous relationship, however, both of their names were on the registration. I immediately noticed Long had scratches on his neck that appeared to be fresh. When asked, He stated he did get them from his wife, who grabbed him plus scratched him in his throat. He advised he had to protect himself, but did not state how.&amp;nbsp; Long stated he asked Vinson to get out of the car. Vinson was seated in the car in the passenger&amp;#39;s seat going through and messing with his stuff. He stated that is when he reached in to grab his hats/ belongings that were in the car. He stated at that point, Vinson scratched/ grabbed his neck. Long stated he did not want things to get to this point, he was trying to leave. When later asked, Long did admit that he had been drinking prior in the night. Long also later stated Vinson had given herself the injury to her lip, and he did not do that. Long stated he later asked her what happened to her lip, but did not specify whether he saw Vinson cause the injury to her lip or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I then made contact with Vinson. I noticed Vinson appeared to have a busted/ scratched lip as she had blood that was around and on her lip. The blood appeared to be drying, but did appear to be from a recent injury. Vinson stated she got into the car, did not do anything, and Long had strangled her. She stated she had entered the car to get away from Long. Vinson stated at one point she could not breathe, but she was not exactly sure the manner Long had strangled her. Vinson also stated Long has strangled her in the past and she had to get medical attention for it. I asked if she had scratched Long which she stated she did, but it was in defense. Vinson&amp;#39;s neck did appear to be red from a recent altercation or incident. I did not observe any bruising on Vinson&amp;#39;s neck and she denied any medical attention. When asked how she got the injury on her lip, she stated she was not exactly sure how Long had hit her, but he did hit her and cause her lip to be injured when he got into the car and strangled her. She also later stated her voice and swallowing were different from being strangled. Vinson later also stated they had both been drinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point, I reviewed footage from a camera that was attached above the garage where the incident occurred. The footage shows Vinson inside the front passenger seat, with the door open and Long comes over to the vehicle. Long then reaches across Vinson. After a second or two, an altercation begins. At one point, it appears that Long&amp;#39;s arm is extended towards Vinson, however it is unclear if he was grabbing Vinson by the neck as she stated. It did appear that his arm or arms were up by her neck/head area during the altercation. It is unclear at what point both Vinson and Long sustained their injuries or who caused injury first, however at one point while Long&amp;#39;s arms are towards Vinson, it appears her arms go up near his neck area. During the video Long yells for Vinson to &amp;ldquo;stop playing games&amp;rdquo; and Vinson yells at Long to &amp;ldquo;Go, and get the fuck out of here.&amp;rdquo; It should again be noted that Long and Vinson are married and live together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An MSP Domestic Violence Supplemental Form was filled out with Vinson by Tpr Walker #7519, where she screened in as a high danger. Grace from The Southern Maryland Family Advocacy Center was contacted while Tpr Walker was on scene. Vinson did talk to Grace who is a counselor with the Southern Maryland Family Advocacy Center. Both parties were advised on Protective Orders. Long was also informed he could file charges against Vinson if he wished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to both parties having signs of physical injury, but the physical altercation starting when Long reaches into the vehicle across Vinson. Long was determined to be the aggressor, Long was placed under arrest at 0020 hours. He was placed into the front seat of my patrol vehicle, seat belted, advised he was being audibly and visually recorded, and transported to the Saint Mary&amp;#39;s County Detention Center pending a bond review with a District Court Commissioner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Long was charged with Assault Second Degree, Case closed by arrest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Saint Mary&amp;rsquo;s County, MD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;On 7/6/2023 at approximately 1030 hours, I attempted to contact the victim, Stephanie Vinson via telephone utilizing the phone number listed on the MSP Form # 246. Vinson did not answer, a detailed voicemail was left with my contact information, I requested she return my phone call. I checked secure case search and did not observe any Protective Orders issued in relation to this incident. I also observed the suspect, Robert Long was charged with 2nd Degree Assault and released from custody on 7/6/23 on a $2500 unsecured bond. Vinson did screen in as high danger and spoke to a counselor while on scene with Tpr. Walker.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; No further.&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Since the last supplemental report was filed, I was able to speak to the victim, Vinson via telephone on 7/10/23 at 1315 hours. While speaking to Vinson about the recent domestic violence incident she was involved in, she advised she did not want any charges filed against the suspect. I advised her the suspect, Long was arrested the night of the incident and charged with 2nd Degree Assault at SMCDC. Vinson advised she wanted to use her marital rights to drop the charges. I advised Vinson she would have to contact the States Attorneys Office, I provided Vinson with their number. I then asked Vinson if she needed any further assistance from MSP or the SMCFA, she replied not at this time. I then offered her the SMCFA&amp;#39;s phone number, she advised she already has it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; No further.&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
