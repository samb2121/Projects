He also advised Jahmere left without his cell phone due to him taking it away as part of his punishment from the earlier incident.&amp;nbsp; I asked what school Jahmere attended, and he advised he was currently in 8th grade at Mt Savage School, however there is no school this week due to spring break.&amp;nbsp; Mr Baugher was able to provide me with a current picture of Jahmere which has been placed in the case file.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; After the above, M/T Lechliter and I checked there area around Mt Savage with negative results.&amp;nbsp; M/T Lechliter then checked Rt 36 up to Frostburg and I checked Rt 36 to Corriganville also with negative results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; At this time, Jahmere&amp;#39;s whereabouts are unknown.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; Jahmere will be entered into NCIC.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;After the above, at approximately 0720 hrs, Mr. Baugher contacted the barrack by phone and spoke with Sgt Bennett, advising that Jahmere has returned home.&amp;nbsp; The total time that Jahmere was missing was approximately 4 hours.&amp;nbsp; Jahmere was removed from NCIC.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; Case closed.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
