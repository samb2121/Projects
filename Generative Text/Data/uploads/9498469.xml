There did not appear to be any additional nearby surveillance of footage of the incident. Victim was found with cast-iron umbrella stand tied around his left ankle and was laying on the pool deck on his back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 09/17/2023, at approximately 0833 hours. I. Tpr Jenkins #7357, was dispatched to 13388 Rollie Rd West, Bishopville, MD 21813 in response to a family member at the bottom of a pool. Upon arriving on scene, I observed Bishopville EMS was already there with some family members of the victim. The victim was later identified as Dino Iacchetta by his wife Lori Iacchetta, who was on scene. Dino was laying on his back on the side of the pool area with a yellow plastic rope tied to his left ankle and attached to an approximately 50-pound cast-iron umbrella stand. The umbrella stand along with Dino&amp;rsquo;s left leg just below the knee, was still in the pool water. Dino&amp;rsquo;s arms were out away from his sides. Dino appeared pale, wearing a black &amp;ldquo;White Marlin Open&amp;rdquo; T-shirt and black athletic shorts. Dino had deep rope-like indentations around his left ankle from what appeared to be the yellow rope and weight of the umbrella stand. William Cooper with Bishopville EMS pronounced D. Iacchetta deceased at approximately 0845 hours. I made contact with L. Iacchetta, who advised she last saw her husband at approximately 2230 hours when they went up to bed on 09/16/2023. L. Iacchetta that D. Iacchetta was restless and had gone downstairs around 2245 hours since he could not sleep. L. Iacchetta advised she did not see Dino again until she looked out of her second story bedroom window the morning of 09/17/2023 at approximately 0810 hours and observed Dino in the pool as it faced the same side the pool was on. L. Iacchetta advised that Dino was underwater but appeared to be in a vertical position. At that time L. Iacchetta advised she went outside right away and attempted to pull Dino from the pool using the pool rescue hook but was unable to do so. L. Iacchetta had called her daughters Gina Bell and Maria Thompson at approximately 0828 hours, who lived in the neighborhood, and advised them of the situation. Bell and Thompson advised they arrived on scene at approximately 0835 hours and attempted to pull Dino out of the pool with L. Iacchetta, but were ultimately unable to do so. Thompson returned to her home and picked up a family friend, William Hrebik to help. Hrebik and Thompson advised they returned to the scene around 0840 hours and were successful in pulling Dino mostly out of the pool, with just his lower half below the waist remaining in the water. By that time, EMS was on scene and pulled Dino further out of the water, to where just his left leg below the knee along with attached umbrella stand were remaining in the water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L. Iacchetta advised Dino had sold his business (Williamsville Country Village Shopping Center) in Selbyville, DE on 12/29/2022 but later had second thoughts about doing so. Iacchetta advised Dino did not plan to retire from his construction company (Iacchetta Builders) but that he was having problems where the foundation of a recent job was &amp;ldquo;messed up&amp;rdquo; prompting Dino to walk away from the job. L. Iacchetta advised she was in Florida on vacation with family while Dino was at home for a week in April 2023. L. Iacchetta advised she was concerned about Dino and returned home to Maryland on April 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2023. After returning home, L. Iacchetta advised Dino had taken the car in the middle of the night on April 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; around 2300 hours and drove to his former property at Williamsville Country Village. Dino had reportedly &amp;ldquo;slipped&amp;rdquo; off of the roof there around 2300 hours, but admitted after the fall that he had gotten up on his roof at home 5 times while the family was away in Florida. L. Iacchetta advised that Dino had told her he would contemplate suicide while he was up on the roof of their home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dino went to Beebe Hospital in Delaware after his fall for injuries to his right side, right arm, right leg, and head. L. Iacchetta advised that while at Beebe Hospital, Dino spoke with hospital staff and advised he was upset about a job he was working on where the foundation was bad. Family members advised Dino had anxiety about the problematic job foundation and was encouraged by family to see a psychiatrist at Beebe Hospital. Hospital psychiatrist reportedly advised that Dino had depression and anxiety but was not suicidal. Dino was sent to Sun Behavioral Health for 8 days by Beebe Hospital around 05/31/2023. Gina Iacchetta (Dino&amp;rsquo;s daughter) advised she lived at home with her mom and dad along with her two kids. Gina advised she left home around 1730 hours on 09/16/2023 to go out for the evening. Gina&amp;rsquo;s kids were away for the evening as well and as Gina was about to leave for the night, she advised her father Dino asked her if she or her kids would be returning home that night. Gina advised Dino did not talk to her much and that it seemed like Dino was making sure that no one would be coming back home that evening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dino was taking the following medications:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Levothyroxine (75 MG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Buspirone HCL (10 MG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Trazadone (100 MG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Rosuvastatin Calcium (10 MG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Trintellix (10 MG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Buspirone HCL (5 MG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A copy of this report along with MSP 89B sent to OCME.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

See Cpl. Townsend&amp;#39;s body camera for footage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pictures of the scene were captured and uploaded to the attachment section.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On September 17, 2023, at approximately 0833 hours, troopers assigned to the Maryland State Police - Berlin Barrack were dispatched to 13388 Rollie Road West Bishopville, Worcester County, MD, 21813 for the report of a suspected drowning. Due to the nature of the incident, I S/Tpr Jeffrey Hoffmeister #6163 along with Cpl. Daniel Townsend #6692 assigned to the Criminal Enforcement Division - Eastern Region (CEDER) responded to the scene. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Upon arrival, it was learned the victim, Dino Ottavio Iacchetta [hereinafter referred to as Dino] (W/M, DOB: 11/24/1957) was found in the bottom of his swimming pool tied to a yellow string tied to a cast iron umbrella holder. Dino was found on September 17, 2023, at approximately 0810 hours [8:10 a.m.], by his wife Lori Ann Iacchetta [hereinafter referred to as Lori]. Dino was pronounced deceased by Paramedic William Cooper of Bishopville EMS (EMS Run #23-006027) at approximately 0845 hours [8:45 a.m.]. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I contacted Lori who advised she last saw and spoke to Dino on September 16, 2023, at approximately 2230 hours [10:30 p.m.] before they went to bed. Lori advised Dino got up around 2245 hours [10:45 p.m.] to go downstairs because he was restless. This was normal of Dino according to Lori.&amp;nbsp;Dino and Lori were the only ones present within the household overnight. On September 17.2023 hours at approximately 0810 hours [08:10 a.m.] Lori woke up and looked outside, Lori looked in the pool and saw Dino at the bottom in vertical position. Dino was wearing a black t shirt and black shorts he was wearing the night prior before bed. Lori went outside and attempted to get Dino out of the pool; however, his leg was attached to a yellow string tied to a cast iron umbrella holder. Lori advised she called her daughters identified as Gina Marie Bell [hereinafter referred to as Gina] and Maria Erica Iacchetta-Thompson [hereinafter referred to as Maria] who were staying just down the road. When Gina and Maria arrived on scene they attempted to help Lori pull Dino out of the water; however, they were unable to due to the additional weight attached to him. Maria called 911 and had a friend identified as William Henry Hrebik [hereinafter referred to as William] arrived on scene, who was able to pull Dino&amp;#39;s body completely out of the water. Lori advised Dino had a previous suicide attempt back in April 2023. According to Lori, Dino fell from the roof of the Williamsville shopping center where he broke his arm and leg. Before that incident in April 2023, Dino texted Lori while she was in Florida and advised her he went on the top of the roof of their residence and was thinking about jumping off their roof. Ever since these incidents, Lori advised Dino has been depressed. According to Lori, Dino was a builder and recently had a business transaction fall through (problem with a foundation he built); in which he believed he was going to be sued and face some sort of legal action. According to Lori, Dino was planning on retiring after completing this job. Dino was also stressed from selling their shopping center they owned which was sold in December 2022. Dino was second guessing his choice to sell the property as it was as one of their main sources of income. Lori advised, Dino did not consume alcohol or use any illicit drugs. Dino was seeing a psychiatrist after the April incidents; however, he was told he was fine and diagnosed him with depression and anxiety. Lori believed something was wrong with Dino as noticed him to walk/pace around the house and &amp;quot;whimpers&amp;quot; all day. Dino was prescribed several medications; Rosuvastatin calcium 10mg, Buspirone HCL 10 mg, Trazodone 100 mg, Levothyroxine 75mcg and within the past two days began taking Trintellix 10 mg.&amp;nbsp; Dino&amp;#39;s primary physician was Dr. Nicholas N. Borodulia, MD of Fenwick Island. Lori advised she has not been able to locate any type of suicide notes around the house that Dino may have left behind. Dino did not have any type of conversations with Lori about suicide. According to Lori she had been married to Dino for approximately 42 years. Around 30 years ago Dino and Lori had their financial advisor named Mark Keen of Keen &amp;amp; Pocock out of Washington D.C. create a life insurance policy for the both of them. Lori advised she last spoke to Mark Keen in May but neither her nor Dino have made any changes to it to her knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I spoke with Gina who was able corroborated the statements made by Lori. Gina advised she last saw Dino on September 16, 2023, at approximately 1730 hours [5:30 p.m.] before she left the residence for the night and ended up staying the night with her sister down the street. Gina advised, Dino was severely depressed, he doesn&amp;#39;t say much, paces around the house, &amp;quot;its like he was a zombie&amp;quot;. Dino asked Gina if she was heading out that night, which Gina thought was strange at the time as that was not normal for him to inquire about. Gina advised when Dino fell off the roof of the Williamsville shopping center in April it happened out of nowhere. Dina advised, Dino never had suicidal thoughts before that and ever since then he has been a completely different person. Gina advised Dino was taking his medication as prescribed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I spoke with Maria and William who were both able to corroborate the statements made by Lori and Gina. Maria advised Dino has not been normal since April when he jumped off the roof. Maria advised Dino would pace around the house and was paranoid. Maria stated Dino thought people were out to get him and if you were having a conversation with him in the room he would think it was about him. William had never met Dino prior to this incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I observed Dino&amp;#39;s body lying just on the edge of the pool. Dino was laying on his back with his left ankle tied to a yellow rope which was attached to an approximately 45-50-pound cast iron umbrella holder. The cast iron umbrella holder was still submerged in the water. Dino was cold to the touch and slight rigor mortis was present. Dino was starting to develop lividity on his back. Dino was wearing a black shirt and black short. After surveying the scene, a portion of yellow rope was located in a nearby storage container. Also, present were scratch marks near the deep end of the pools edge; which may have been made from the cast iron umbrella holder when it was pushed into the pool. A video camera was located by the pool area that faced toward the house; however, it was discovered the video camera did not save and only provided live view footage. Dino&amp;#39;s cellular device was located, and no pertinent information was obtained. Investigators did not locate any sort of suicidal note. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Forensic Investigator Lawrence Towles with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME/ME #23-11464) responded to the scene, and it was determined Dino&amp;#39;s body would be transported to the OCME&amp;#39;s Office for an autopsy. Bishop-Hastings Funeral Home of Selbyville responded to the scene and transported the body. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;No signs of foul play were observed and the family&amp;#39;s statements were consistent with what was observed by on-scene investigators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case remains open pending autopsy report. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
