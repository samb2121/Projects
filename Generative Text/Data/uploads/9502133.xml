         <NarrativeText>On 11/15/2023, I, Sgt. Angermeier received a call from SAFE nurse Cheryl Young (717-860-3355) regarding a patient at the Wayspan Waynesboro Hospital who wanted to report she was sexually assaulted. The alleged victim, Morgan Hines, 26 YOA was placed on the phone. I could immediately detect that Hines&amp;#39; current mental state was not appropriate to speak to her regarding any incident. Hines would barely let this investigator speak as she would attempt to tell me what had occurred. In time, I was able to ask Hines if she would be able to come to MSP Hagerstown for an interview and she advised she could not because she was being placed into an inpatient mental health facility. Hines was then went on to explain that she was somewhere between Baltimore and Hagerstown. She advised she and a transport driver, later identified as Howard William Coleman, 76 YOA had left a Baltimore hospital due to them not wanting to take care of her there. Hines explained she had been to many hospitals and mental health facilities over the passed several days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hines advised after her and Coleman had left Baltimore, they were driving west, (believed to be I-70). Hines said she was tired so she rested her head on the center console of Coleman&amp;#39;s vehicle. She explained that Coleman then began rubbing her back and she did not want him to rub her back. I asked Hines if she told him to stop and she advised she did not. This made Hines upset. Hines then advised she was transgender and did not want to be called &amp;quot;ma&amp;#39;am.&amp;quot; Hines went on to explain that Coleman was handicap, as he had a handicap placard on his silver pickup. I again would advise Hines that I would prefer to speak to her in person at MSP Hagerstown, however she preferred to tell her story over the phone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hines stated that later as they were driving westbound, Coleman pulled off the roadway onto the shoulder (unknown location). She advised they both exited the vehicle, she sat on the running board of his pickup, and she performed oral sex on Coleman. I asked Hines if she told him she did not want to perform oral sex and she again got very upset with this investigator. She advised she did not tell him no, but she did not want to do it. I asked Hines what happened after she performed oral sex and she advised they stood outside of the pickup and smoked a cigarette. I asked Hines if she was forced into anything and this again made her upset and at this time, her therapist picked up the phone. Her therapist advised she was going to be admitted into Brooklane or another mental health facility.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Later, SAFE nurse Cheryl Young called this investigator and advised she did a oral SAFE exam on Hines. Young went on to explain that Hines also told her the alleged incident and advised that Hines&amp;#39; did not disclose any force used or anything that she did not consent to.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Young advised she would drop off the SAFE exam at MSP Hagerstown as she drives passed it every day going to and from work. The SAFE exam was dropped off and placed onto MSP Form 67, Chain of Custody by this investigator. The kit was placed into MSP Hagerstown property.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This case was briefed with ASA Christine Remsburg and also Debbie Heller of the MSP Crime Lab regarding the SAFE kit. ASA Remsburg advised this case would not be prosecuted due to the fact that at this time, there was no disclosure of a non-consensual encounter. Heller stated the SAFE kit would not be tested due to the case not being prosecuted and the alleged crime being unfounded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It should be noted that on 12/5/2023, I made contact with the alleged suspect, Howard Coleman. He advised he remembered Hines and that he had to take her to and form numerous hospitals and mental health facilities. Coleman advised he never stopped anywhere to or from any of the destinations nor did he do anything inappropriate with Hines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed as unfounded at this time.</NarrativeText>
