         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:14px"&gt;DWI # S-23-108&lt;br /&gt; Defendant &amp;ndash; Alfredo Reyes Rios (H/M, DOB 06/03/1986)&lt;br /&gt; Maryland Driver&amp;rsquo;s License # MD10272881304&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Certification and Training:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Trained and certified to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests by the Maryland State Police in accordance with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Received additional training in Advanced Roadside Impairment Detection Enforcement (ARIDE) in accordance with NHTSA. I attended the Maryland State Police Advanced Driving under the Influence training. I attended the 2021 Maryland Impaired Driving Conference in Ocean City, Maryland hosted by NHTSA.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This investigation was recorded by a Body Camera equipped to my uniform. K9-24 is not equipped with an in-car camera.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On August 19, 2023 at approximately 0022 hours I, Trooper First Class Prince was located on Route 18 at Castle Marina Road, Chester Maryland 21619. I observed a vehicle traveling the opposite direction with one working headlight. I turned around and activated my emergency equipment pulling the vehicle over at the Queenstown Bank parking lot on Castle Marina Road. I identified the vehicle as a Black 2004 Cadillac Escalade with Maryland Registration 2FF7253.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I made contact with the driver who I identified as Alfredo Reyes Rios (H/M, DOB 06/03/1986), through his Maryland Driver&amp;rsquo;s License. I advised Reyes Rios of the reason for the stop. Reyes Rios had his son translate, he advised that they ordered a replacement bulb through Autozone, but it has not come in yet. While talking to Reyes Rios I detected an overwhelming odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I noticed that Reyes Rios&amp;#39; eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I returned to my vehicle and requested another unit after providing dispatch with vehicle and driver&amp;rsquo;s information.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Deputy Cranel with the Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s County Anne&amp;rsquo;s County Office of the Sheriff arrived on location with Trooper Damiano. I made contact with Reyes Rios and requested that he step out of the vehicle. I advised Reyes Rios that I detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I asked Reyes Rios if he had anything to drink tonight. Reyes Rios stated just 1 shot about 30 minutes ago. I asked Reyes Rios what kind of shot, Reyes Rios stated by the bridge. I asked Reyes Rios if he would submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Test, Reyes Rios stated Ok.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Reyes Rios stated that he does have an injury to his left ankle. I asked Reyes Rios if he wore any glasses or contacts, Reyes Rios stated no. I asked Reyes Rios if he was on any medications today, Reyes Rios stated No. I noticed Reyes Rios had gum in his mouth and requested that he spit it out, which Reyes Rios did. I asked Reyes Rios if he could see me fine, Reyes Rios stated yes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS TEST: (CLUES 6/6)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; I explained the tests to Reyes Rios. Reyes Rios stated he understood my instructions. Prior to beginning the test, I held my finger Twelve (12) to Fifteen (15) inches from Reyes Rios&amp;rsquo; nose, slightly above eye level. During the test, Reyes Rios displayed equal tracking in both eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Lack of smooth pursuit was present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; Distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation was present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees was present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; Note: Vertical nystagmus was present.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I advised Reyes Rios that the next test would be the Walk and Turn test. I asked Reyes Rios if he wanted to attempt the test. Reyes Rios stated I can do it but the problem is his ankle. I asked Reyes Rios if he wanted to take his shoes off for the test. I advised Reyes Rios it was up to him. Reyes Rios took off his shoes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; WALK AND TURN: (CLUES 4/8)&lt;br /&gt; The area of the test was free of debris. This test was conducted in the parking lot of the Queenstown Bank&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I explained and demonstrated the test to Reyes Rios prior to my instruction, I advised Reyes Rios to stand with his right foot in front of his left foot, with his right heel touching his left toes and to keep his arms down at his sides. I advised Reyes Rios to remain in that position until instructed to begin the test. Upon completion of the instruction and demonstration, I asked Reyes Rios if he understood or had any questions. Reyes Rios pointed to his son and looked confused. His son who was identified as a 15 year old came out and translated instructions that were given.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Observation Phase:&lt;br /&gt; Reyes Rios missed heel to toe 3 times.&lt;br /&gt; Reyes Rios stepped off line 2 times.&lt;br /&gt; Reyes Rios used his arms for balance and raised them more than 6 inches from his side.&lt;br /&gt; Reyes Rios made incorrect number of steps, 10 steps down and 10 steps back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ONE LEG STAND (0/4)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I advised Reyes Rios the next test was the One Leg Stand test. Reyes Rios stated &amp;ldquo;I told you&amp;rdquo; and reached down to his left ankle. I advised Reyes Rios he could do it on either foot whichever one was better; if he cannot do, it let me know he cannot do it. Reyes Rios&amp;rsquo; son stated that his father has problems with his legs. I asked both of them? Reyes Rios&amp;rsquo; son stated yes about a year ago he got in an accident. I asked if he was unable to do the test. Reyes Rios stated he could try. I advised him it&amp;rsquo;s up to him. Reyes Rios stated he would try.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I explained and demonstrated the test to Reyes Rios. Upon completion of my explanation and demonstration, I asked Reyes Rios if he had any questions. Reyes Rios stated no.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Reyes Rios stopped the test as soon as he started. I asked Reyes Rios if he would submit to a Preliminary Breath Test, Reyes Rios stated sure. The P.B.T results .113. I advised Reyes Rios that he was being placed under arrest for Driving under the influence. Reyes Rios was secured into Trooper Damiano&amp;rsquo;s patrol car where he was played the Maryland Advice of Rights Spanish audio version through the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration website. Reyes Rios was provided a written copy of the form in Spanish so he could follow along with the audio. Upon completion of the form Reyes Rios stated he would submit to the Breath Alcohol Concentration Test. I made contact with Reyes Rios&amp;rsquo; son who contacted his mother who agreed to pick him and his brothers up. I observed 2 other juveniles in the vehicle. I observed a open container of Modelos a known alcoholic beverage located in the back of the front passenger seat which was in access of the juveniles. Deputy Cranel stayed on scene with the juveniles until the mother arrived. Trooper Damiano Transported Reyes Rios to the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack Reyes Rios submitted to the Breath Alcohol Concentration Test. Sgt. Bolduc administered the test which resulted in .14 B.A.C. Reyes Rios was issued all documents and citations. Reyes Rios was released to a sober driver at the Centreville Barrack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s County, State of Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
