         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Unmarked S-12&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 06/22/2023 at approximately 1126 hours, I, Trooper First Class Maranto #7116 of the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack was on patrol in full uniform operating unmarked MSP vehicle S-12. I was dispatched to 105 Clay Drive, Queenstown, Maryland 21658 at the Royal Farms store, for the report of a daughter advising that her father had abandoned her at the store.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon my arrival, I made contact with the female complainant at the rear of the store. I recognized her from numerous previous encounters. I asked for her for identification. A name and date of birth positively identified her as Laurel Mae Burton (W/F DOB: 03/18/1979) of 100 Tolson Lane, Stevensville, Maryland 21666. I had previously been out to the Tolson Lane address on numerous occasions. I asked Laurel what happened today. Laurel advised that her father Thomas, had dropped her off at the Royal Farms and refused to give her a ride home. I asked Laurel if they were arguing prior to this or what happened. Laurel advised that they were arguing because her father did not want her to have a boyfriend. She also stated that he was controlling. Laurel then stated that her father had been sexually assaulting her through &amp;quot;Mind control.&amp;quot; I asked her if they physically assaulted one another, and she told me that her father had assaulted her first, and then she defended herself. I asked how he assaulted her, and she stated &amp;quot;He keeps putting his thingy near my thingy.&amp;quot; Laurel also told me that she has a boyfriend in California named Leo. From previous encounters, I learned that &amp;#39;Leo&amp;#39; was actually Leonardo Dicaprio. Laurel states that he would not leave California to come visit her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I then made contact with the father over the phone. I had previously interviewed him as well from incidents at 100 Tolson Lane. A name and date of birth positively identified him as Thomas Lee Burton (W/M DOB: 10/18/1948) of 100 Tolson Lane, Stevensville, Maryland 21666. I asked Thomas what had occurred today. Thomas stated that he had taken Laurel to Walmart earlier, and now they were heading back home. He stated that while they were driving, Laurel asked for a lighter. Thomas gave Laurel a lighter, and then she punched him with a closed fist in his groin. Thomas asked her why she did that, and she stated &amp;quot;Because you keep putting your dick in my pussy.&amp;quot; Thomas advised he pulled into the Royal Farms where he was again assaulted by Laurel with a closed fist. Thomas then told her that he was leaving her there, and that he did not feel safe around her. He then drove back to his residence. Thomas advised that she refuses to take her medications, and has mental illness. He also stated she can not be trusted, and does not make ant sense of what&amp;#39;s going on. Thomas believes she is hallucinating. Thomas also said she&amp;#39;s been making more and more sexually related stories to him about him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I went and spoke with Laurel again. I advised her that her father doesn&amp;#39;t want to be around him because she assaulted him. She stated that he was using mind control to sexually assault her. I asked Laurel if she was having suicidal thoughts, or self harm thoughts, or had thoughts of harming anyone else. She stated she had no bad thoughts, and did not want to harm herself. She also stated that her father always wants her to go to the hospital, but she doesn&amp;#39;t want to because she&amp;#39;s fine. I told her she needs to stop fighting with her father and to make amends.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I spoke with Thomas again, and advised him that I did not have enough to take Laurel into custody for an Emergency Petition. I referred him to the Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office in reference to obtaining a protective order again Laurel. Thomas told me that he does not feel safe with her around anymore, and wanted her out of his residence because she refuses to get help or take her medications. I advised Thomas of the case number, and asked him if he wished to press charges against Laurel for assault. Thomas told me he did not wish to press charges against her, but would be going to the commissioner&amp;#39;s office in attempt to obtain a court ordered emergency petition, and a protective order. I advised Laurel of the situation, and she had a taxi company come and pick her up at the Royal Farms to take her back to her residence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Thomas did obtain a court ordered emergency petition against Laurel, as well as a protective order. The Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office responded to the residence to serve Laurel.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case be closed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
