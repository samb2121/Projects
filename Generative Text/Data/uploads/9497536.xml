         <NarrativeText>NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On January 19, 2023 at approximately 1000 hours, I responded to&amp;nbsp;23340 Red Oak Court California, MD 20619 and met with complainant, Lisa J. Walter, in reference to her daughter, Addisyn Pope Fedor (W/F DOB: 9/14/08).&amp;nbsp; Walter advised Fedor had been involved in an online relationship with a subject whom she believed was an adult.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Walter stated she because aware of this relationship on January 14, 2023, because she received a random phone call from a subject in California.&amp;nbsp; That subject informed Walter he was afraid of Fedor&amp;#39;s well-being because the suspect in the case has been carrying out the same type of enticement/exploitation to at least two other people.&amp;nbsp; Walter advised the online relationship with the suspect began approximately 2-2.5 years prior.&amp;nbsp; The name the suspect provided to Fedor was Yousef Mahmood.&amp;nbsp; Fedor told the suspect she was 19 years of age, at the time they started talking.&amp;nbsp; During this 2-2.5 year relationship, the suspect did learn Fedor was actually 12 years of age.&amp;nbsp; One of Fedor&amp;#39;s friends was in contact with the suspect and informed him Fedor was actually 12 years old, at which point they continued to talk.&amp;nbsp; Fedor and the suspect would chat via Discord and video chat calls.&amp;nbsp; Discord is believed to be the application they first began talking on.&amp;nbsp; The following name was associated with the Discord account: @Joker-sama.&amp;nbsp; That name was located on the Discord server approximately two years prior.&amp;nbsp; It was learned that Fedor gave the suspect access to all aspects of her life, including passwords and active locations off all family members.&amp;nbsp; While searching Fedor&amp;#39;s email and Discord, an IP address was located, which appeared to be associated with a log-on attempt made by the suspect.&amp;nbsp; The captured IP was 46.19.85.57.&amp;nbsp; Also, while searching Fedor&amp;#39;s phone, videos which were sexual in nature were observed.&amp;nbsp; Those videos had been sent to the suspect, as well.&amp;nbsp; A review of the chat conversations between Fedor and the suspect were located.&amp;nbsp; The suspect told Fedor he loved her, and they would be together in the afterlife.&amp;nbsp; The suspect also indicated to Fedor they were going to have a baby and name it Lucifer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Additional identifiers on the suspect were discovered on Fedor&amp;#39;s phone as well.&amp;nbsp; They included Instagram user names: punpun12321 and mahmood12321.&amp;nbsp; The following name and phone number were also located: Rami Levi (+97255-666-4029).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;An open source search of the IP address,&amp;nbsp;46.19.85.57, revealed it geo-located to Tel Aviv and the service provider is Pelephone.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A review of the Discord account did reveal multiple images which did meet the statutory requirement for child pornography.&amp;nbsp; Two images are described below:&lt;br /&gt; - 1/8/2023 at 2121 hours: One color image of an exposed vagina.&amp;nbsp; The female in the image is utilizing her fingers to spread her vagain.&amp;nbsp; The image is reasonably believed to be of Fedor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; -&amp;nbsp;1/10/2023 at 0535 hours: One color image of a nude caucassian female which displays breasts and vagina, reasonably believed to be Fedor&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Due to the aforementioned facts in this case, the suspect is believed to be living in a different country, which there is no jurisdiction.&amp;nbsp; I request this case be closed.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
