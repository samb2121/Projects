My department issued BWC was operational and recording at the time of the incident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 07/05/2023 at approximately 0644 hours, I, TFC. B. Reilly #6751 of the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack was on roving patrol westbound MD 140 at the intersection of Market Street, Westminster, MD. My patrol vehicle was stationary in the left turn lane with a steady red left turn arrow. At this time, the lights signaling westbound MD 140 through Market Street were green. As the light started cycling to yellow, then red, as I turned to my right, I observed a white 2015 Dodge Ram Pro Van bearing MD temporary registration T4934593 travel through the intersection of the steady red circular signal. I immediately intercepted the vehicle in question, and activated my emergency equipment. The vehicle stopped in the Taco Bell parking lot located at 625 Baltimore Blvd, Westminster, MD 21157.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Once the vehicle was stopped, I made contact with the male driver and advised him the reason for the traffic stop. While making a driver side approach, I noticed the temporary registration was expired 12/2022. The driver advised that he did not have his license with him, and also advised he did not have his registration.The driver was identified through his name and date of birth as Jaime Roberto Lara (2M DOB 10/28/1989). I returned to my vehicle, and license and wanted check was ran through NCIC. Lara&amp;#39;s license returned suspended. I also entered the temporary registration through METERS but did not return to any vehicle. I forwarded this information to Westminster Barrack, and they confirmed the same. I returned to the vehicle to verify the VIN of the vehicle with the registration that was displayed on the vehicle in question. I returned to my vehicle and ran the VIN through METERS, which returned through Maryland, with the registered owner being Lara, but was unregistered. I made another approach to the vehicle to make contact with Lara, who was unable to provide me with any proof of registration. I asked if he possessed any proof of insurance with the vehicle, to which Lara initially stated he had Geico, but then showed me a letter through his email that he had State Farm. I returned to my vehicle, contacted State Farm, and was able to connect to an agent who advised that there was no policy information for the vehicle. She stated that there was an active policy once before, but not anymore. I returned to the vehicle, and advised Lara that I had contacted State Farm and that I was going to request a tow. The tow that was contacted was Apex.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I returned to my vehicle once more, and printed out the applicable citations and notice to appear. Shortly, after, I returned to Lara to issue him the citations and notice to appear when he showed me another email through Progressive listing a policy number with no other information. I returned to my vehicle and contacted Progressive to verify, to which the representative stated the insurance was expired and no active policy existed. I made contact with Lara again, and advised him the same, and also stated that I was going to contact the tow. Apex was contacted back and continued to respond to the scene.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Shortly after, Apex responded to the scene to remove the vehicle. I continued to explain the situation to Lara about his license suspension, unregistered vehicle and driving with no insurance. He stated that he has another friend who could tow the vehicle to save him money. Once I told him Apex was going to be the company who towed the vehicle, Lara immediately entered the vehicle again, engaged the hand brake, exited the vehicle and locked the vehicle. When I asked for the key, Lara said that Apex can take the vehicle. I explained to Lara that the tow company needs the key for the tow lot, to which Lara stated he does not trust anyone with his vehicle. Both myself and the tow driver explained to him that if they do not receive the key for the vehicle, it would cost more in fees. Lara then stated &amp;quot;if it costs more money then it costs more money.&amp;quot; Eventually, I asked Lara to unlock the vehicle, that way the tow driver can easily tow it on the tow bed and also explained to him that winching the vehicle with the handbrake engaged will cause damage to the vehicle, to which Lara stated &amp;quot;if they break something the company is liable for it.&amp;quot; Eventually, Lara handed us the key and disengaged the handbrake. Apex was able to successfully tow the vehicle, and Lara left the scene with his ride.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Due to the above stated facts, I respectfully request this case closed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Carroll County, MD.</NarrativeText>
