         <NarrativeText>Interviews with victim, suspect, witness and family captured on body cam&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; Digital photos were taken of the victim&amp;#39;s injuries and attached, also uploaded to Veripic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On Sunday February 19th, 2023 at approximately 1617 hours, I was dispatched to respond to 519 A&amp;nbsp; Main st, Church Hill, Queen Anne&amp;#39;s county, Maryland in reference to an assault. I was advised two juveniles were involved in a physical altercation at Church Hill park.&amp;nbsp; Upon arrival, EMS personnel were assessing the victim, Liam Howell. As they were assessing Howell, I spoke with Howell&amp;#39;s mother and sisters. Mother, Alecia Barton, stated that her son had gone to Church Hill park by himself even though his sister usually accompanies him. Barton stated Howell called her at 1556 hours crying and in hysterics saying another boy had beat him up and tried to choke him at the park. At that time his sisters went and picked him up from the park. Barton said Howell knew who the boy was from previously attending school with him at Sudlersville Middle School, but Howell now attends Centreville Middle School. She added that he had been transferred due to bullying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; Howell refused to be transported to the hospital. Howell was seated on the couch holding a bag of frozen vegetables over his left eye. He was sporadically crying and complaining of pain in his head, left eye, right side of his neck, and right side of his torso. When I asked Howell what had occurred he stated he went to the park and was sitting on a concrete divider in the parking lot. He added that he was looking for something to draw. His mother then interjected that he is an artist. Howell said a boy named &amp;quot;Doug&amp;quot; came over with his girlfriend (name unknown)&amp;nbsp; and began telling him that people were making fun of him and talking about him. Howell said he knew that it was Doug picking on him and there was a verbal exchange between the two of them. Howell then stated that he &amp;quot;defended his pride&amp;quot; and attempted to strike Doug. He stated Doug then struck him several times with a closed fist while Howell was on his back on the parking lot. Howell said he took Doug&amp;#39;s bracelet off of his wrist, which he gave to me. Howell sustained the following visual injuries: contusion to his left eye; contusion to the right side of his neck; and superficial lacerations to his right torso. No blood was observed. (PHOTOS TAKEN)&amp;nbsp; After the assault, Howell said they went toward the &amp;quot;big neighborhood&amp;quot; indicating houses near Oakmont Ave. Howell described Doug as 13-14 years old, skinny, approximately 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot; tall, wearing a gray shirt, white socks, tennis shoes, and carrying a black and orange backpack. He described the girl only has having blonde hair and indicated she lived in the green house on the corner of Main St and Walnut St. The area was checked no subjects matching the descriptions were located.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; On Monday February 20th, 2023 I received information from Deputy Goodman from the Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County Sheriff&amp;#39;s office that he responded to Church Hill park in reference to a suspicious male. When he made contact with the male, the male indicated that his nephew had been assaulted at the park on the 19th. The male added that he just wanted to attempt to locate &amp;quot;Doug&amp;quot; in order to talk to both Doug and his nephew to settle things. While Deputy Goodman was speaking to the male, Howell&amp;#39;s sisters also responded to the park and pointed out Doug at the park. Deputy Goodman then made contact with Doug, &amp;quot;Douglas Canapp&amp;quot;, and his father, &amp;quot;Louis Canapp&amp;quot;. (names corrected later in this report)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Deputy Goodman indicated that Doug had admitted to the altercation stating that Howell had attempted to hit him first and struck his backpack. Deputy Goodman obtained contact information for the Canapps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; On Wednesday February 22nd, 2023 at approximately 2000 hours, I met with suspect Ronald Douglas Canapp, and his father Louis Vincent Guarnera at their residence. Canapp began the conversation by stating that he knew Howell from school and they had always been &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; with each other but not quite friends. He stated that he and his girlfriend Olivia were at the park playing basketball when they observed Howell at the park. According to Canapp the other juveniles they were playing basketball with began to talk about Howell in a derogatory manner. Canapp stated Howell previously had erratic and violent behavior at school so he decided to approach Howell and advise him of this. Canapp said his intent was to hopefully have Howell leave the park and avoid further bullying or an altercation. He stated Howell responded to him in a negative manner so he began to walk away from him. As he walked away Canapp said he felt something go over his head so he ducked. When he turned around Howell was directly behind him and had attempted to strike Canapp and had kicked Canapp&amp;#39;s backpack. Canapp said he told Howell to leave him alone and began to walk away and Howell threw his boot at him. Canapp again told Howell to leave him alone and Canapp began walking away backwards. Howell rushed towards Canapp and put his bike in front of Canapp. He said Howell kept turning the front wheel to prevent him from walking away. Howell also began to threaten to assault Olivia. Canapp said he grabbed Howell&amp;#39;s arm and pulled him off the bike and told him again to leave him alone. According to Canapp, Howell continuously spit on him and attempted to strike him. Canapp said Howell had fallen to the ground when he pulled him off the bike and he held Howell down on the grass to prevent him from assaulting him or Olivia. Canapp said when Howell started crying and screaming he and Olivia left the area. Canapp said Howell also stole his bracelet off his wrist during the altercation. I returned Canapp&amp;#39;s bracelet to him. Canapp and his father advised they did not wish to pursue any charges against Howell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I then responded to 529 Main st, Unit A and spoke with Olivia Pierce. Pierce confirmed the account of the altercation that Canapp gave. She stated she was very surprised at Howell&amp;#39;s reaction to Canapp&amp;#39;s attempt to advise him of the other juveniles possibly attempting to bully him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then responded to Howell&amp;#39;s residence and spoke with his mother Barton. When I advised Barton of what Canapp and Pierce had stated about the altercation, Barton stated she thought something like that may have occurred. She then advised me of Howell having behavioral issues which led to him transferring schools and that he has therapists and assistants at school due to his behavior. Barton stated she did take Howell to the hospital later in the evening when the assault occurred and the doctor stated he sustained no serious physical injury. Barton was satisfied with my investigation of the case and not pursuing law enforcement or legal action against either party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CASE CLOSED</NarrativeText>
