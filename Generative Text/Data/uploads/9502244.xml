         <NarrativeText>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-a2a77de4-7fff-f187-eee4-f0424d797595"&gt;On 1/16/24 Sgt. Newcomer made contact via telephone with Ray Anthony Mitchum, B/M, 9/17/59 in relation to a CIB complaint that was received stating Mitchum wanted to speak with Colonel Butler.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-a2a77de4-7fff-f187-eee4-f0424d797595"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mitchum advised he has been speaking with a female from Ghana via text messaging for close to a year. Mitchum advised the female from Ghana was involved in a bus accident with her family. Mitchum advised that police from Ghana contacted him via telephone and advised he was responsible for her medical bills. Mitchum advised he sent money to cover the medical expenses of the female and received another call stating the female was kidnapped and if he did not send more money they would contact Colonel Butler of the Maryland State Police to get him in trouble. To date Mitchum has sent over $7,000 to people in Ghana for this scheme. I advised Mitchum this is a common fraudulent scheme to get money from United States citizens and should not send any more money. I further advised Mitchum to change his telephone number and/or block the numbers calling him to prevent further fraudulent activities. I advised Mitchum to get LifeLock or another identity protection software to make sure his identity had not been stolen. Mitchum advised he wanted to contact the Maryland State Police to make sure he was not in trouble and to ask about jurisdiction questions related to the things he was being told from the police in Ghana. I advised Mitchum that we have no record of him being in trouble with us, and he was a victim of a scheme. Mitchum advised he would have no further contact with the people from Ghana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-a2a77de4-7fff-f187-eee4-f0424d797595"&gt;Mitchum advised he was going to be reaching out to a friend who is an investigator with the United States Capitol Police to see if they could provide him any more information regarding the matter and I asked if he needed me to put him in contact with someone from their department. Mitchum advised no, his friend would take care of everything for him and appreciates Sgt. Newcomer providing him insight into this matter. Mitchum advised he would not like any further assistance from the Maryland State Police. Sgt. Newcomer gave Mitchum his contact information should he need further assistance or questions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-a2a77de4-7fff-f187-eee4-f0424d797595"&gt;This case is closed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>
