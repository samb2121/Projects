         <NarrativeText>On January 25, 2023, MADTF investigators were contacted by Detective Shifflett of DSPII in reference to information about suspected drug parcels sent from California to a trailer park in Montgomery County. Investigators were able to locate information for a suspicious parcel that was sent from California to &amp;quot;Genaro Gomez&amp;quot; at a trailer park at 19515 Frederick Road, Germantown, Maryland 20876. An actual unit / trailer number was not listed on the parcel.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Deconfliction was made with Montgomery County Police - SID and Gaithersburg City Police Street Crimes and it was discovered that Gaithersburg Street Crimes had worked an investigation in the summer of 2022 resulting in a knock and announce search warrant at mobile home number 148, where quantities of cocaine and drug proceeds were seized. It was discovered that the trailer park was very difficult for surveillance and known MS-13 gang members were residents there who sold controlled dangerous substances at the entrance and had look-outs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On January 30, 2023 at approximately 0645 hours, investigators were conducting proactive parcel interdiction efforts at the Federal Express Ground Facility located at 800 North Frederick Avenue, Gaithersburg, Montgomery County, Maryland 20879 based off the information from Detective Shifflett. During these efforts, the attention of investigators was directed to a brown cardboard box that displayed numerous shipping anomalies and it was removed from the delivery stream for further investigation. Montgomery County Police Officer Richardson and his canine partner Axel conducted a canine scan on the target parcel and other non-target parcels, resulting in a positive alert for the odor of narcotics for the target parcel. A search and seizure warrant was authored for the parcel. Concurrently, investigators left a door tag with a call back number to the &amp;ldquo;leasing office&amp;rdquo; at the trailer park. The search warrant revealed that the parcel contained six heat-sealed bags of marijuana. FedEx did not grant an extension for a controlled delivery of the parcel and it was seized. As of this briefing, no consignees have called back requesting re-delivery of the above parcel. Investigators will continue to monitor the trailer park address for any future suspicious parcels.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I respectfully request this case be considered&amp;nbsp;suspended.</NarrativeText>
