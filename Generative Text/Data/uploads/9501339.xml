The radio dispatch also advised a hispanic male was observed to be walking away from the scene. I arrived on scene and observed a White Hummer H3 bearing MD registration (4EZ7239) stopped in the middle of the road straddling lane 1 and lane 2. The vehicle was resting while facing at an angle and wasn&amp;#39;t parallel with the road. I approached the vehicle and observed the driver&amp;#39;s seat was empty. I looked at the front of the vehicle if there where any signs of damage to verify if this was the vehicle that was part of the initial description in the dispatch. I observed no damage on the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{892b5b38-eb96-4f43-a5b2-e9f766cccad4}{99}" paraid="1242747743" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;PERSONAL CONTACT (Phase 2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{f67dc88e-98fa-4810-906e-ad66f88a7e40}{18}" paraid="223285715" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;I next reached for the driver&amp;#39;s door to see if it was left unlocked. The door was unlocked and when I shined my flashlight in the front row I didn&amp;#39;t observe anyone. I shined my flashlight in the back row and due to my height and the Hummer being higher, I didn&amp;#39;t immediately observe there was a male sitting on the second row passenger side seat and had his head tucked in to his jacket. Since I couldn&amp;#39;t clearly see all the seats I called out &amp;quot;Hello.&amp;quot; I was surprised I got a verbal response which was difficult to discern due to the speech sounding slurred. I noticed the male occupant sticking his head out of his jacket. I observed the occupant was a hispanic male,&amp;nbsp; who was later verbally identified as Santos Leonel Izaguirre Rodriguez. I asked Izaguirre Rodriguez who was driving the vehicle,and he replied nobody. I asked Nobody? and he reaffirmed &amp;quot;Nobody.&amp;quot; I asked why was the vehicle stopped in that spot? Izaguirre Rodriguez stated &amp;quot;It just stopped here.&amp;quot; I asked him again who was driving the vehicle though, and he again said nobody. I asked him are you alone in the vehicle or is there someone else with you and he stated &amp;quot;Someone with me.&amp;quot; Izaguirre Rodriguez then began to open the passenger side door to exit the vehicle and I told him to stay in the vehicle out of concern for his safety since traffic was passing around his vehicle on that side. Izaguirre Rodriguez was not obeying my instruction so I repeated my command in a stern voice and he asked why, I told him cause I am telling you to stay in your car. He scoffed at me and continued exiting the vehicle. I walked around to the other side and noticed Izaguirre had bloodshot and glass eyes, he struggled to maintain his balance while standing still. I asked him if he had any weapons and asked if I could pat him down and he stated it was okay. I asked Izaguirre Rodriguez to stand in the area between my patrol vehicle and his to avoid standing where cars where passing. While patting him down, Izaguirre Rodriguez said I have nothing on me, I have nothing, I just broke down what did you want me to do. I asked him if there was anyone else with him in the car and he replied &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have anything I lost my wallet.&amp;quot; I asked Izaguirre Rodriguez, &amp;quot;So you where driving the car?&amp;quot; He paused for a few seconds and said &amp;quot;Yes, but like I told you the car ran out of gas I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything.&amp;quot; I asked Izaguirre Rodriguez how long he&amp;#39;s been sitting there and he said like 10 minutes. I asked him where he was headed to and he said home. I asked him where he was coming from and he said &amp;quot;From work to my house.&amp;quot; I asked him if he had any alcoholic beverages and he said &amp;quot;None.&amp;quot; I asked him does his gas gauge work, and he said &amp;quot;Of course.&amp;quot; I asked him if it works then why didn&amp;#39;t you gas up before running out of gas, and he said &amp;quot;I was just on my way home.&amp;quot; Once Tpr. Stacey and Tpr. Strawser arrived to assist, we where able to push the Hummer to the right shoulder. After confirming Izaguirre Rodriguez identity, I asked if he would be willing to submit to Three Standardized Field Sobriety Test. He agree to the test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{f0a0033a-259d-47d5-a1f4-75a76467a2b3}{218}" paraid="374491167" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;PRE-ARREST SCREENING (Phase 3)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{72fd7ad0-6c22-4ccf-ace6-a53368f1053f}{175}" paraid="1268725977" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder of Soutthbound MD Rt 4. The surface was wet, level, and free from any debris. The weather was cloudy and rainy. My patrol vehicle forward emergency lights were deactivated during all three tests. Izaguirre Rodriguez appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{6b284776-772b-4643-9ddc-3c7af8fcf7e1}{71}" paraid="915793148" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Izaguirre Rodriguez was asked the following questions:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Glasses or Contacts - No&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Medical Conditions - No&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Injuries - No&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Medication - No&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{6b7d85e2-2637-4c6b-bde7-909d964d9ad4}{59}" paraid="1301623203" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6 of 6 clues observed)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; The first test was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.

He was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and remain in that position until told to begin. He was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, He was instructed to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. He was instructed that the second series of nine steps were to be formed identical to the first series of nine steps.
