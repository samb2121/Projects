         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;This incident was audibly and visually recorded using the Axon Digital Video Camera System installed in Maryland State Police Unit, U-16, as well as my Axon body worn camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Narrative:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;On July 4, 2023, at approximately 0005 hours, the Calvert Control Center dispatched a traffic lookout for a possibly impaired driver. The Control Center advised the vehicle was traveling North on Solomons Island Road from Solomons, Calvert County, Maryland and was driving all over the roadway in the wrong lane. The Calvert Control Center advised the vehicle was blue and was bearing Virginia registration, &amp;ldquo;UED6234&amp;rdquo;. The Control Center advised the Virginia registration returned to a Nissan.&amp;nbsp; I, TFC Moorman #6980, was on uniformed patrol operating unmarked Maryland State Police Vehicle, U-16. I was traveling South on Solomons Island Road approaching Southern Connector Boulevard. I made a U-turn to travel North on Solomons Island Road attempting to locate the vehicle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;I was traveling North on Solomons Island Road in lane two when I observed a blue truck traveling North in lane one. I observed the truck was having difficulty maintaining within lane one as it was drifting from left to right and crossing over the roadway lines. I noted the truck was a blue Chevrolet bearing Virginia registration, &amp;ldquo;UED6234&amp;rdquo;. I relayed the registration to the Barrack dispatcher who advised the registration returned to a 2015 Nissan. The dispatcher advised the registration was expired 2/2022. I continued following the Chevrolet and observed the driver&amp;rsquo;s side and passenger side brake lights were inoperative when the driver activated the brakes. The third brake light was the only operative stop lamp. I observed the Chevrolet drift to the left and cross over the roadway line by one tire width for approximately five seconds. The Chevrolet continued North drifting heavily from left to right within lane one. I observed the Chevrolet drift to the left and cross over the solid yellow roadway line by one tire width for approximately four seconds. The Chevrolet applied its brakes and slowed down to 30 mph in a posted 55 mph speed zone. We continued traveling North at 30 mph approaching the traffic signal at Cove Point Road. I observed the Chevrolet drift to the left and cross over the roadway line by one tire width for approximately three seconds. I observed the Chevrolet drift to the right and cross over the center dashed roadway line by half of the vehicle width for approximately three seconds before drifting back into lane one. The Chevrolet continued traveling North at 30 mph and was drifting heavily from left to right within lane one. I followed the Chevrolet for approximately 1/2 mile at 30 mph in a posted 55 mph speed zone. I activated my emergency equipment to initiate a traffic stop. The Chevrolet came to a complete stop in lane one of Northbound Solomons Island Road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;I made a driver&amp;rsquo;s side approach and made contact with the driver and front seat passenger of the vehicle. While making my driver&amp;rsquo;s side approach, I observed a small bottle of wine resting between the truck bed and truck cab. I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle. I informed the driver for the reason of the traffic stop. The driver stated they were fishing and heading home. I informed the driver about the registration returning to a Nissan. The driver stated he recently purchased the truck in Laurel, Maryland and his friend let him borrow their registration plates. I asked the driver if the vehicle had insurance, and he stated it did not. I asked the driver for his driver&amp;rsquo;s license. The driver advised he did not have his license with him. I asked the driver for any form of identification. The driver showed me an insurance card and bank card with his name, &amp;ldquo;Conklin Evans Goard&amp;rdquo;. The driver advised his name was, Conklin Evans Goard, B/M, DOB: 06/18/1951. Goard advised his driver&amp;rsquo;s license was through Washington DC. I asked Goard when his last drink of alcohol was. Goard advised he consumed one 12-ounce Icehouse beer one hour prior to driving. While speaking with Goard, I noted his eyes were bloodshot and glassy. I requested Goard to exit the vehicle and walk to the front of my patrol vehicle. Goard exited the vehicle and I noted he urinated on himself. Once at my patrol vehicle, I requested Goard to complete voluntary Standardized Field Sobriety Testing to which he agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;I am trained in the administration of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. That training was received at the Maryland State Police Academy and has been utilized in multiple prior DUI arrests. I have also completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;While speaking with Goard outside the vehicle, I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath as he spoke. The testing was conducted in lane one of Solomons Island Road, which was blocked by police vehicles for safety. The area was a paved surface that was flat, level, and free from all debris. I asked Goard if he had any injuries or medical conditions that would impact his ability to complete the testing, and he stated he did not. I asked Goard if he takes medications, and he stated he takes medication for glaucoma. I noted Goard was wearing glasses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Test One &amp;ndash; Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Goard had normal-sized pupils and displayed equal tracking in both eyes. I had to instruct Goard to follow the stimulus with his eyes only multiple times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;1. Goard displayed the lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;2. Goard displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;3. Goard displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Total Clues: 6 of 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Test Two &amp;ndash; Walk and Turn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;I instructed Goard into the instructional position. Goard broke the instructional position twice claiming he has bodily injuries and a crooked spine. Goard became argumentative and refused to complete any further testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;1. Goard could not keep his balance in the instructional position and broke heel to toe contact twice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Total Clues: 1 of 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Test Three &amp;ndash; One Leg Stand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Total Clues: Test refused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Additional Processing:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Goard was placed under arrest for DUI/DWI at 0027 hours. During a search incident to arrest of Goard, I observed one burnt cigarette containing suspected Cannabis residue in his jacket pocket. I observed the suspected Cannabis was a &amp;ldquo;personal use&amp;rdquo; amount due to my training, knowledge, experience, and previous drug arrests. Goard was placed in my patrol vehicle and was played the DR-15 Advice of Rights audio in English. Goard refused to submit to an alcohol concentration test at 0055 hours. I transported Goard to the Calvert County Detention Center for processing. While transporting Goard, the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage permeated the interior of my patrol vehicle. Goard was issued numerous traffic citations including DUI related offenses. Goard was extremely uncooperative while in my custody and yelled numerous racial slurs. Goard became uncooperative with the Calvert County Detention Center staff and had to be placed in a restraint chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;Case closed by arrest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
