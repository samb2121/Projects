         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;A copy of the emergency petition can be found in &amp;quot;Attachments.&amp;quot; There were no visible injuries that I could see to photograph.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217), am equipped with a body-worn camera. My body-worn camera was active during my response to this incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;A neighborhood check was not conducted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;SUBJECT OF EMERGENCY PETITION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;NAME: LOGAN MICHEAL SMITH (W/M)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; DATE OF BIRTH: AUGUST 9, 2001&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ADDRESS: 10 BLACKBORNE DRIVE, ELKTON, MARYLAND 21921&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; TIME PETITION FILED: APPROXIMATELY 1830 HOURS&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; DATE OF EMERGENCY PETITION: APRIL 2, 2023&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;On April 2, 2023, at approximately 1714 hours, I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217) of the Maryland State Police, was dispatched to 10 Blackborne Drive, Elkton, Maryland 21921 in response to a physical domestic dispute involving a mentally ill adult male. During dispatch, I was advised by the Maryland State Police North East Barrack that the caller had her son restrained. I arrived on scene at approximately 1723 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon arrival, I observed a younger white male being restrained by a second, older white male and a white female. All three subjects were on the ground of the residence&amp;#39;s garage. I could hear the restrained male yelling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; When I approached, I made contact with the three individuals on the ground and two others standing by. I identified the restrained male as Logan Micheal Smith (see &amp;quot;Subject of Emergency Petition&amp;quot;). The male restraining him was his father, Derek Adam Smith (W/M; DOB: 10/21/1983), and the female restraining him was his mother, Margaret Elizabeth Smith (W/F; DOB: 09/10/1984). Derek had his legs wrapped around Logan&amp;#39;s body and his arms wrapped around Logan&amp;#39;s neck, and Margaret was restraining Logan&amp;#39;s arms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Considering Logan was able to speak, I could tell his airway was not blocked. For the purposes of safely de-escalating the situation, I asked him if he would be okay with speaking to me if he allows me to detain him and have him sit upright. Logan agreed to the terms I proposed. Margaret relinquished one of his wrists, and I placed one of my handcuffs on the first wrist she released. I then instructed Logan to roll to his stomach, at which time he did and I was provided with his second wrist. Once I had him completely handcuffed, I assisted him with getting up and I escorted him outside to the front porch of the residence to separate him from his parents. Logan allowed me to handcuff him without incident or the need for force on my part.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I had Logan speak with Trooper First Class Bachu (#7184) while I spoke to Logan&amp;#39;s parents. I identified the other two individuals on scene as Logan&amp;#39;s grandparents, Donald Andrew Smith (W/M; DOB: 11/21/1953) and Sara Fay Smith (W/F; DOB: 02/29/1956). I gathered from speaking to Derek, Margaret, Donald, and Sara that Logan has been in-and-out of mental health and substance abuse treatments. I gathered he still uses 10 Blackborne Drive as his legal residence, but he has not actually stayed at 10 Blackborne Drive for approximately seven months. I was told he was living out of his car, at friends&amp;#39; houses, and at times with Donald and Sara.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I gathered that Logan returned home the evening of April 1, 2023, and then at some point left to visit a friend in Pennsylvania. That friend then dropped Logan off at 10 Blackborne Drive shortly before the call for service for this incident was placed. Derek and Margaret told me Logan attempted to enter the house through the garage. However, Derek and Margaret attempted to keep him from coming in, as they suspected he was impaired by some controlled substance. When they attempted to prevent him from coming inside, Logan then lashed out and started to shove Derek and Margaret before attempting to force his way inside. Donald and Sara told me they witnessed at least part of the assault, and they put Logan as the aggressor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Derek and Margaret told me Logan was previously diagnosed with an unspecified psychotic disorder. However, they said he has never lashed out like this before. They also said he did not damage property.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Derek and Margaret told me they did not have any injuries/marks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Derek and Margaret also told me Logan keeps telling them to kill him and choke him out. Derek said Logan was previously admitted to the hospital for self-harm reasons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; When I attempted to speak with Logan, he was aggressive. For example, when I asked if he wanted to hurt himself, he responded by asking me if I wanted to hurt myself. He did this multiple times. He then made other strange/incoherent statements. For example, he asked me if I was going to &amp;quot;put on my Matrix goggles or something.&amp;quot; He made multiple comments that I believe, based on their nature and his aggression, were his attempt to encourage me to point a firearm at him. For example, he attempted to stand up at one point. After being told to stay seated, he said &amp;quot;Should I stand up? If I do, are you going to shoot me with a gun, if I stand up?&amp;quot; He then went on to say, &amp;quot;Are you going to shoot me with the gun? That&amp;#39;s a little excessive. You can, like, put the gun in my face. You can draw it on me . . . you can draw it on me but I won&amp;#39;t do anything because I don&amp;#39;t harm people.&amp;quot; He was handcuffed as he said this and there was no reason a rational person would think it necessary to point a firearm at him. The comments he made were extreme for the current de-escalated state of the incident (and the entirety of the incident for that matter, which did not at any point result in anyone drawing a firearm).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At one point, while I wasn&amp;#39;t actively speaking to him, he said, &amp;quot;You suck, go fuck yourself . . . put your hand in a fist, you&amp;#39;re ass, put your hand in a fist, because you suck.&amp;quot; He then giggled and repeated to ask me to put my hand in a fist. My hands were relatively relaxed at my sides, so I&amp;#39;m unsure what the obsession was with &amp;quot;my fists.&amp;quot; Even as I continued to not pay attention to him and discuss the incident with Trooper First Class Bachu, he continued to repeatedly ask me to put my hand in a fist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also observed Logan&amp;#39;s nose was runny, his mouth seemed crusty and caked with saliva, and his pupils were constricted. Coupled with his aggressive/erratic behaviors and statements, and his parents&amp;#39; description of his treatment history, I strongly suspect Logan was impaired by a controlled substance of some kind. Logan denied having taken any substances. At one later point, he indicated his appearance was all due to crying. However, the severity of his behaviors coupled with what I previously stated still lead me to suspect otherwise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Logan also claimed his parents were the aggressors and that they shoved him first (contrary to what both his parents and grandparents were saying).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Based on the following facts, I decided to file an emergency petition against Logan:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - I discovered Logan&amp;#39;s parents restraining him on the floor of their garage. He was yelling and behaving aggressively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Logan&amp;#39;s parents told me he assaulted them when attempting to enter the residence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Logan&amp;#39;s grandparents also stated Logan was the aggressor and that he was assaulting his parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Logan was aggressive even when communicating with me.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Some of Logan&amp;#39;s statements did not make sense (such as repeatedly asking me to ball my hand into a fist or asking if I would put on &amp;quot;Matrix goggles&amp;quot;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Logan made aggressive comments that I believe were his attempt to encourage me to point a firearm at him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Logan&amp;#39;s parents told me he has been previously treated for psychiatric and substance abuse issues, and they advised he is diagnosed with an unspecified psychotic disorder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Logan&amp;#39;s parents advised part of the reason why Logan was previously hospitalized was due to self-harm issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At approximately 1751 hours, I advised the North East Barrack that Logan was officially in custody for an emergency petition. Logan&amp;#39;s parents were provided with my name/rank/identification number, the case number, and the barrack non-emergency line on a brochure. I advised them that since Logan technically has legal residency (based on their account of things), they need to file an eviction notice against him to legally prevent him from entering the residence. I also advised them that they can apply for criminal charges against Logan at the Cecil County Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office in relation to this incident if they wish.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Logan&amp;#39;s parents also provided a list of his medications, which include (as provided by them): Respirodol 1mg (AM), Zoloft (AM), Respiradol 2mg (PM), and Benadryl 2 tab (PM).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I transported Logan to Union Hospital in Elkton, Maryland for treatment. We arrived at Union Hospital at approximately 1816 hours. My body-worn camera was de-activated in the hospital for the purposes of preserving patient privacy. I completed an emergency petition for Logan there before clearing the scene at approximately 1845 hours. Logan was left in the care of Union Hospital staff when I cleared.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case be suspended pending an application for charges from Logan&amp;#39;s parents regarding the assault.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
