         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This incident was captured via body-worn camera, S-23.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Wednesday, September 20, 2023, at approximately 2034 hours, I was on duty, in uniform, operating marked vehicle, S-23. I responded to 215 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; St, Crumpton, MD 21628, for a reported trespassing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon arrival, I made contact with a female in the driveway who was later identified as Leigh Ann Logullo (W/F DOB: 05/21/1988). Logullo was clearly inebriated. I immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath and her speech slow and slurred. I questioned Logullo about the what took place earlier. Logullo was either very delayed in her responses or did not answer the question. Logullo stated she lives at the residence and that this was her house. She could not tell me what happened prior to our arrival.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I made contact with the male half and identified him as Kory Justin Dean (W/M DOB: 09/17/1988). Dean advised Logullo has not lived at the residence since October of 2022, but comes to the residence occasionally to visit their child. Dean stated previously that afternoon, Logullo texted him, asking to come over. When Dean called her later, he stated she knew she was drunk and told her not to come over anymore. According to Dean, Logullo came to residence anyway and began pounding on the doors and windows for Dean to let her inside. Dean stated he never allowed her inside the residence and she remained outside for hours, texting him to let her come inside. Dean stated he repeatedly told her to leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I then spoke to Logullo again and told her she could not be at the residence because she does not reside there and does not have belongings there. She then became belligerent yelling at me that &amp;ldquo;every single thing she owns&amp;rdquo; is in the house. I told her not to interrupt me when I was talking. Logullo then yelled &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t give a fuck, fuck you&amp;rdquo; and began walking away from me. I then told Logullo she was under arrest and ordered her to place her hands behind her back. Logullo repeatedly yelling, &amp;ldquo;No I&amp;rsquo;m not&amp;rdquo; and put both of her hands up and backed away from me. When I stepped towards her, she extended both of her arms and pushed my forearms, in an attempt to shove me away from her. Logullo actively resisted even after being told multiple times to that she was under arrest and needed to comply. Force was used to take Logullo into custody.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logullo was place under arrest at 2053 hours, placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle, and was transported to the Centreville Barrack for processing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logullo was transported to the Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s Commissioner and was temporarily committed due profuse vomiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s County, Maryland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On 09/20/2023 at approximately 2029 hours, I, Trooper Elburn #7076 and Trooper Pettitt #7174, currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack responded to 215 Second Street, Crumpton, Maryland 21628 for a trespassing complaint. The complainant, later identified as Kory Justin Dean (W/M DOB: 09/17/1988) called the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack and advised that his ex-girlfriend was outside of his residence banging on the windows of the house and had been for the past few hours. He advised that she was trespassing and did not live at the residence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We arrived on scene and I made contact with Dean while Trooper Pettitt made contact with the suspect who was standing by her vehicle. The suspect was later identified as Leigh Ann Logullo (W/F DOB: 05/21/1988). I talked to Dean and he advised that she had been outside of his house since around 1630 hours banging on his windows and doors. He advised that she appeared to be extremely intoxicated and would not leave after multiple attempts of telling her to. He advised that she has not lived at 215 Second Street since last October after she cheated on him. He advised that he wanted her to leave and his kids were trying to sleep and she was disturbing them. He advised that she called him and sounded drunk asking to come over, and he told her to not come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I then spoke with Logullo with Trooper Pettit. I asked her where she was living now and she advised that she lives with her parents in Earlville. I asked her when she had her last drink of alcohol and she stated recently. I observed Logullo to be very intoxicated from my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper. We advised Logullo that she needed to leave the residence and she was trespassing on the property. She then advised to us that she lives in the house, contradicting her previous statement that she lives at her parents. I then went back to speak with Dean and he advised that she has not lived at that residence since last October when he kicked her out after she cheated and that she was not on the rental agreement for the residence. He then confirmed that she lives with her parents in Earlville and not at 215 Second Street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To try and de-escalate the situation, we gave Logullo the option to call a ride to come pick her up and she refused and stated that she could not call her parents to get her because &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not supposed to be here&amp;rdquo;. We both attempted to have her call her parents or another person to come and pick her up due to her intoxication and she repeatedly refused. I also asked her for her parents&amp;rsquo; numbers so that I can call them on her behalf and she refused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to prior contact with this suspect and her mental state, I asked Logullo questions pertaining to an emergency petition and she advised that she did not wish to hurt herself or others. I then tried to de-escalate the situation by informing her that we needed her to get a ride or contact someone to meet us so we could remove her from the situation to resolve the incident. She refused to contact anyone and advised that she lives at the house. During this time, Trooper Pettitt was gathering further information from Dean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trooper Pettitt then asked Logullo if she had any property in the house and advised her that she was not referring to a toothbrush. At this point Logullo became disorderly and started screaming at Trooper Pettitt. Trooper Pettitt attempted to gain control of the situation verbally and Logullo turned away from us and attempted to walk away and stated &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t give a shit, fuck you.&amp;rdquo; At this point, Trooper Pettitt ordered her to turn around and that she was under arrest. Logullo stated &amp;ldquo;no I&amp;rsquo;m not.&amp;rdquo; Logullo then actively resisted arrest and placed both of her hands on Trooper Pettitt and pushed her. At this point, I grabbed Logullo&amp;rsquo;s right arm and utilized a soft empty hand control technique to stop her from striking. Logullo kept actively resisting by pulling her hands away and Trooper Pettitt repeatedly ordered her to stop. Trooper Pettitt then placed a cuff on her right wrist and Logullo started screaming at the top of her lungs and trying to pull away. We then used soft empty hand control techniques to gain control of her arms. Logullo then attempted to walk away and Trooper Pettitt softly placed her against the car while maintaining control of her arm. I then used a soft empty hand control technique to put her left arm behind her back. Trooper Pettitt was then able to place the other cuff on her wrist. We then assumed an escort position by placing our hands underneath of her arms to guide her to Trooper Pettitt&amp;rsquo;s patrol vehicle due to Logullo refusing to walk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trooper Pettitt then completed a search incident to arrest of Logullo and she was placed inside of the vehicle. Once compliance was gained all force ceased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This concludes my involvement in this case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
