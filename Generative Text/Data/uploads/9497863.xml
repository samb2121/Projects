         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On February 3, 2023, I, M/T Eric Schramm #2841, received an email from Sgt. Jonathan Martin #4841 of the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit, advising of a tip that came via telephone call to the Cumberland Barracks in reference to a cold case homicide. The cold case homicide was identified as that of Joan Ann Charlton. Charlton&amp;rsquo;s body was recovered on the campus of Frostburg State University on September 13, 1983. This case was originally investigated by the Maryland State Police and was assigned case number O-52-07114. The caller was identified as Donald Edward Shriver Sr (W/M 07/07/1939), telephone 240-284-2753.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Telephone contact was made with Shriver and a meeting was set for February 7, 2023, at 1000 hours at the Cumberland Barracks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On February 7, 2023, at 1000 hours, Sgt. Jonathan Martin and I, met with Shriver as scheduled. Shriver advised that he wanted to speak with us about the person he thought was responsible for the death of Charlton and his relatives. Those people were according to him Bob Booth (born approximately 1940 from Midland, MD), former Frostburg State Police Officer Bob Drees, and Bob Drees&amp;rsquo;s wife, unknown name. According to Shriver, Bob Drees&amp;rsquo;s wife was the sister of Bob Booth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Shriver advised us that he had known Bob Booth since they were young. Shriver stated that in the 1950&amp;rsquo;s or 1960&amp;rsquo;s he traveled to the Washington, DC area with Booth to look for employment. Shriver and Booth found work as painters, painting tall radio towers and bridges. According to Shriver, he could not deal with the heights associated with the job, and he returned home to the Frostburg area. Shriver indicated that Booth remained in the Washington, DC area after he departed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Eventually, Booth returned to the area and Shriver and him would often shoot pool together. Sometime in the 1950&amp;rsquo;s or 1960&amp;rsquo;s after Booth returned to the area, he received news that his mother was struck and killed by a vehicle in the Washington, DC area. Booth traveled back to the Washington, DC area for the funeral and returned home. According to Shriver, Booth learned that his mother was struck and killed by an African American man and made racial slurs indicating his dislike for African Americans. Shriver more specifically remembers Booth saying that he was going to get even and kill an African American person even if it took him his whole life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Shriver said that he worked at Frostburg State College some in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s and again around 2000&amp;rsquo;s. Shriver said that Booth also worked at the college as a painter. Shriver believed that Booth was employed at the college as a painter at the time of the murder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Shriver told us that around 2000 when he was employed there he was in Annapolis Hall and Booth walked in and began making coffee. Shriver said that is when he remembered that Booth had made those comments about killing and African American person. He remembered Charlton was last seen at Annapolis Hall; therefore, giving Booth the opportunity and access to Charlton.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; According to Shriver, Booth was involved in running the operations of a bar called &amp;ldquo;The Patch&amp;rdquo; located in Midland, Maryland. Shriver surmised that Booth kidnapped Charlton from the college, drove her to the bar, killed her, then drove her back to campus and dropped her off.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Shriver said he remembers reading newspaper articles about Charlton when she was killed. He remembered reading that Officer Drees was involved in the investigation and Shriver believed he was the lead investigator. Shriver said that Bob Drees always walked around the old Beall High School approximately 20 years ago. Shriver said that he spoke to Drees about his suspicions. According to Shriver, Drees was upset about the accusations and denied that they were true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; According to Shriver he never confronted Booth about his suspicions because he was afraid of Booth. Shriver said that Booth had a reputation as being tough. Shriver recalled that he challenged Booth to a fight one night at a bar and he ended up beating Booth. He said that after the fight he was leery of Booth, out of fear that Booth would retaliate for the fight, although they remained friends afterward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Shriver told us that Bob Booth died approximately 5 years ago. He said that he himself is getting older and his health is not the best, so he wanted to tell someone about his suspicions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A search of local obituaries revealed a James Robert Booth, born May 13, 1940 of Midland, Maryland, died on July 3, 2017. The obituary mentions that he retired as a painter from Frostburg State University. The obituary mentions his father but no mention of his mother was present. It also indicates that he is survived by a sister, Shelly Drease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On February 15, 2023, Sgt. Martin and I traveled to Frostburg State University Human Resources Department and met with Lee Ann Nightingale. We inquired with Mrs. Nightingale about James Robert Booth&amp;#39;s employment at Frostburg State University. Mrs. Nightingale accessed Booth&amp;#39;s records, and we learned that Booth was employed as a painter at FSU from April 2, 1986, until his disability retirement on February 1, 2002.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Since Booth was not employed at Frostburg State University until approximately 3 years after the murder, this makes Shriver&amp;rsquo;s theory impossible and makes Booth no more likely to have committed the crime than any other citizen. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Report closed, Cold Case Homicide remains active.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
