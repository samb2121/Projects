         <NarrativeText>Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 6/28/2023 at approximately 0054 hours, I was dispatched to 14201 MacFarlane Green Ct, apt 301, Upper Marlboro, MD 20772, to assist Tpr. Ware and Tpr. Stacey, with a possible break in of a Trooper&amp;#39;s apartment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon my arrival I made contact with both troopers who informed me that Sonya Theresa McGriff, B/F, DOB 04/11/1967 had attempted to enter the apartment by force using a crow bar. When I asked Trooper Stacey if she explained why she was doing that, McGriff had explained that she had not heard from F/Sgt Anthony Alexander since around 2pm that afternoon and was concerned for his welfare since he had not been answering his cell phone. McGriff explained to both Trooper Ware and Stacey that she was Alexander&amp;#39;s fiancee and has been in a relationship with him for 10 years. I asked Tpr. Ware and Tpr. Stacey if they had made contact with anyone inside the apartment and they stated no.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked Tpr. Ware and Tpr. Stacey to make entry in the apartment and to see if F/Sgt Alexander was inside and if he was okay. I asked McGriff when was the last time she spoke with F/Sgt Alexander and she stated around 2pm earlier in the day. McGriff stated to me that she was just concerned that nothing bad had occurred to him inside the apartment. F/Sgt Wiesemann called me by cell phone and asked for an update to the situation, I explained that Tpr. Ware and Tpr. Stacey where checking the apartment. He asked that I go with them to ensure everything was okay. I responded to the apartment to check on Tpr. Ware and Tpr. Stacey. I noticed they were standing outside by the doorway. I also noticed the door to the apartment was badly damaged. F/Sgt Alexander had provided the passcode to his apartment so we could enter. I asked if they had searched the entire apartment and they stated not yet. I entered the apartment and began to call out F/Sgt Alexander&amp;#39;s name, and began to search through the apartment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When I entered the bedroom, I noticed F/Sgt Alexander was standing behind the bedroom door. I asked if he was okay, he stated &amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; I asked him if he knew the female outside, F/Sgt Alexander stated yes, it was an ex partner, but he didn&amp;#39;t want to have any contact with her so he just avoided answering the door. I asked F/Sgt Alexander if he wanted to press charges for the damaged property, and he stated no. I also asked F/Sgt Alexander if he wanted to hurt himself he said &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; Tpr. Stacey returned to McGriff and explained that everything was okay and that F/Sgt Alexander would reach out to her later on in the day. McGriff left the scene with no further incident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed due to F/Sgt Alexander not wanting to press charges on McGriff for MDOP.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Prince George&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On June 28, 2023 at approximately 0035 hours, I, F/Sgt. Wiesemann #5573 was the Duty Officer at the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack. At this time the barrack phone began to ring. I looked at the display on the phone and it said &amp;ldquo;Alexander A.&amp;rdquo; From previous phone conversations I knew the person calling was F/Sgt. Anthony Alexander.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I answered the telephone. After doing my introduction I heard F/Sgt. Alexander introduce himself and then say, &amp;ldquo;Do you know if PG County is busy?&amp;rdquo; I did not understand the question so I began to ask further questions. F/Sgt. Alexander stated he had someone banging on his front door. I could hear loud banging in the background of the phone call. I obtained F/Sgt. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s address from him, 14201 MacFarlane Green Court, Upper Marlboro, and advised him I was going to send Troopers. A short time later F/Sgt. Alexander stated the person was breaking into his residence. I went over the radio, provided the address to the Troopers, and advised them to respond code. During this time I continued to hear loud banging in the background of the phone call. A short time later F/Sgt. Alexander advised the subject had left and that he was okay. The phone call then ended. During the conversation with F/Sgt. Alexander he appeared confused and would give contradicting&amp;nbsp;statements. It should be noted this summary does not encapsulate the entire conversation I had with F/Sgt. Alexander. The telephone I spoke to him on is recorded and to hear the complete conversation one should listen to the recording.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I went over the radio and advised the two closest Troopers to continue to the scene, routine response. Tpr. Ware and Tpr. Stacey advised they were in the area and would respond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, I called the dispatch center for the Prince George&amp;rsquo;s County Police Department and asked them if they had received a call for service for F/Sgt. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s address. They stated they received a 9-1-1 hang up from that address a short time ago. They stated there was no voice contact. I asked for the number that called and it matched F/Sgt. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s cell phone number, 301-536-8144.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once Tpr. Ware and Tpr. Stacey arrived on scene, they relayed to me that they located a female with a crowbar outside of F/Sgt. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s apartment. The female advised the Troopers that she was F/Sgt. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s fianc&amp;eacute; and was attempting to get into the apartment because she feared F/Sgt. Alexander was suicidal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tpr. Stacey called me on my cell phone and I asked him to give the phone to the female so I could speak with her.&amp;nbsp; I introduced myself to the female and asked her to explain what had happened. She stated she has been in an intimate relationship with F/Sgt. Alexander for 10 years and they are engaged. She stated she spoke to him on the phone at 1400 hrs today and described him as sounding &amp;ldquo;down.&amp;rdquo; She stated after their phone conversation at 1400 hrs, she had not been able to get ahold of him. She stated her career field deals with suicidal subjects and she was concerned F/Sgt. Alexander was suicidal. I asked her if F/Sgt. Alexander had made any suicidal statements recently and she said, &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; I asked her if there was something going on in F/Sgt. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s life that would cause her to think he would want to kill himself and she stated he has been having medical problems. I asked her why she had a crowbar with her and she stated she was using it to try and get into the apartment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, I had S/T Ortiz respond to the scene to assume the investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I called F/Sgt. Alexander and advised him that there were Troopers outside of his apartment and I told him to step outside to speak with them, to make sure he was okay. He advised me that he was not currently home. I advised him that I knew he was home. He stated he was driving home and would be home in approximately 1 minute. S/T Ortiz, Tpr. Stacey, and Tpr. Ware contacted F/Sgt. Alexander, who was inside the apartment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I instructed S/T Ortiz to complete an incident report, to document this incident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At approximately 0300 hours F/Sgt. Alexander arrived at the Forestville Barrack. He came up the stairs and asked if he was in trouble. I informed him that I viewed him as the victim. I informed him that notification was made about this incident up the chain of command and that someone might be reaching out to him. Additionally, F/Sgt. Alexander informed me that the female that was banging on the door was not his fianc&amp;eacute;. He stated, &amp;ldquo;My girl was the one inside.&amp;rdquo; I told him that she stated that she had been in an intimate relationship with him for 10 years. He replied by saying, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, we went out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;No further police actions were taken on my behalf. Refer to S/T Ortiz&amp;rsquo;s report for further details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Prince George&amp;rsquo;s County, MD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;p&gt;This incident was recorded via body worn camera.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On June 28, 2023, at approximately 0030 hours, I, Trooper Ware # 7467 and Trooper Stacey #7390 were dispatched to&amp;nbsp;14201 MacFarlane Green Ct, Upper Marlboro, Maryland 20772 for a possible breaking and entering in progress at a Trooper&amp;#39;s residence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon our arrival myself and Trooper Stacey #7390 were met by a black female in a blue dress who we later identified as&amp;nbsp;Sonya Theresa McGriff (B/F, DOB: 04/11/1967), McGriff advised that she wanted a check welfare done on F/Sgt Alexander due to him not sounding normal on the phone when she spoke with him last. McGriff advised that he sounded suicidal. McGriff told me that he was possibly intoxicated, she said he sounded sleep, yet he said he was working. McGriff became concerned because she stated F/SGT Alexander vehicle was parked at his residence, yet he told her he would call after work.&amp;nbsp; McGriff did not provide myself or Trooper Stacey with factual statements or evidence that F/Sgt Alexander well-being was at harm. I had already Spoken to F/SGT Alexander prior to arriving on scene to which he advised that he was safe and not home.I could hear in his voice that he was completely coherent and not inebriated. Furthermore, he would like McGriff to leave his property.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At this time S/Trp Ortiz #5858 arrived on scene and advised us that he would stay downstairs with McGriff while myself and Trooper Stacey went upstairs and checked the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Myself and Trooper Stacey went upstairs and noticed the door was badly damage and was missing the doorknob completely. I noticed there was a pass-code needed to enter the residence I contacted F/Sgt Alexander to obtain the pass code to gain entry to the apartment. Once I received the pass code I entered it and the door unlocked. Due to its current state the door did not open immediately after a few turns of what was left of a handle the door opened and myself and Trooper Stacey made entry. I began to call out F/Sgt Alexanders name, with no answer. I checked the bathroom and the closet when S/Trp Ortiz # 5858 called us on the radio and asked what apartment we were in. At this time myself and Trooper Stacey preceded to back out of the apartment to meet with S/Trp Ortiz.&amp;nbsp; S/Trp Ortiz advised we were all going to search the apart if it was not currently done already. We all entered the apartment, and began searching again. S/Trp Ortiz located F/Sgt Alexander behind the bedroom door near a closet. We made sure F/Sgt Alexander was ok, and he advised everything was fine, and he wanted McGriff to leave the premises. We left the apartment and told McGriff that everything was ok. We informed McGriff she could now leave. At which time to my surprise McGriff got in her Prince George&amp;#39;s County Marked Sheriff vehicle and left.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of the above events did occur in Prince George&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>

McGriff advised that he sounded suicidal, however she could not advise any suicidal statements he made. McGriff did not provide us with any factual statements made my F/Sgt Alexander to indicate that his well-being was at harm. I learned once we arrived on scene that Trooper Ware spoke with F/Sgt Alexander on the phone while we were en route to his address and he advised he was ok and nothing was wrong. He advised Trooper Ware that he was not home and wanted McGriff to leave. While we were on scene trying to call F/Sgt Alexander, I observed McGriff walk away with a blue crowbar and put it behind a nearby shed. At this time S/Trp Ortiz #5858 arrived on scene and advised us that he would stay downstairs with McGriff while myself and Trooper Ware went upstairs and checked the apartment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Myself and Trooper Ware went upstairs and noticed the door handle and the door itself were damaged, and the door handle was broken off of the door completely. Trooper Ware texted F/Sgt Alexander to obtain the pass code to gain entry to the apartment. Once Trooper Ware received the pass code to gain entry into F/Sgt Alexander&amp;#39;s home. Myself and Trooper Ware made entry and began to call out F/Sgt Alexander&amp;#39;s name, with no answer. Trooper Ware began to check the bathroom and the closet when S/Tpr Ortiz called us on our agency issued radio and asked what apartment we were in. At this time we backed out of the apartment to go meet S/Tpr Ortiz. S/Tpr Ortiz then entered the apartment with us, and we began searching again. S/Tpr Ortiz located F/Sgt Alexander behind a bedroom door near a closet. We made sure F/Sgt Alexander was ok, and he advised everything was fine, and he wanted McGriff to leave the premises. F/Sgt Alexander did not wish to press charges on McGriff. We then left the apartment and told McGriff that everything was ok, and we told her she could leave now. At this time McGriff got in her vehicle and left.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of the above events did occur in Prince George&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>
