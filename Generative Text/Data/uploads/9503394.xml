Tyler #6787 of the Maryland State Police (MSP)&amp;nbsp;Annapolis Barrack was stationary on the right shoulder N/B Rowe Blvd S/O Taylor Avenue, when I observed a dark in color SUV in my rearview mirror approaching me at a high rate of speed in lane one. With my Golden Eagle II radar activated which I&amp;rsquo;m trained and certified to use, I obtained the speed of 56mph in a 40mph zone. At that time, I proceeded after that vehicle to conduct a traffic stop. I conducted a traffic stop on that vehicle N/B Rowe Blvd &amp;nbsp;N/O E/B Rt. 50. The vehicle was a gray Dodge Journey bearing Maryland registration 6EY9298.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;While advising the driver for the reason for the stop, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from the driver&amp;#39;s vehicle and person. The driver only rolled his window down about the size of a driver&amp;rsquo;s license when I was speaking with him. I observed the driver&amp;#39;s eyes to be red, watery, and glassy. The driver&amp;#39;s speech was also slightly slurred. I asked the driver to furnish his driver&amp;rsquo;s license and registration. The driver was identified by his Maryland license as Ryan De Mario Johnson, (B/M DOB 05/14/1988) of Shady Side, Maryland. On my second approach I asked Mr. Johnson if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages before operating the vehicle. I also asked him where he was coming from, Mr. Johnson advised me that he was coming from a party in downtown Annapolis, MD and that he had some Tequila while at the party. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Due to the odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Mr. Johnson&amp;#39;s vehicle and person and his demeanor after I made contact, I asked Mr. Johnson to step out of the vehicle to perform the Standard Field Sobriety Tests. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The test surface was dry, level and free of debris. The weather was clear and the testing area was illuminated by streetlights and my flashlight. Before administering the Standard Field Sobriety Test, I asked Mr. Johnson if he had any prior injuries that would prevent him from completing the tests correctly.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;I asked Mr. Johnson the following questions:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Glasses or contacts- No&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Medical Conditions- Stated &amp;ldquo;A dry left foot&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Injuries- No&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Medication- No&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The first test given was Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Mr. Johnson&amp;#39;s eyes. Mr. Johnson was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Mr. Johnson&amp;#39;s pupils were equal in size and had equal tracking.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation- Present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;3) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees- Present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;4) Vertical Nystagmus- Present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;WALK AND TURN (4/8 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Mr. Johnson was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and heel to toe touching. Mr. Johnson was instructed to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin the test. Mr. Johnson was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Mr. Johnson was instructed to keep his hands flat at his sides, keeping his eyes focused on his feet and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Mr. Johnson was instructed to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to the left to turn completely around. Mr. Johnson was again explained the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Mr. Johnson was instructed once he began the test he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his sides, look down at his feet, and count aloud each step. I asked Mr. Johnson if he understood the test and he stated, &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instructional Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Cannot keep balance- Unable to stay in instructional position as told once.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Walking Stage (1st Nine)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. Missed touching heel to toe on steps- 1-9&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;3. Steps taken- 10&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Turn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 4. Completed unsatisfactory. &amp;nbsp;(Mr. Johnson displayed a military facing movement to turn completely around in which the direction he started.) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Walking Stage (2nd Nine)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Missed touching heel to toe on steps- 1-9&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ONE LEG STAND (completed satisfactory)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. Mr. Johnson was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was instructed to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Mr. Johnson was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; Mr. Johnson completed the test satisfactory but while counting during the test he said one thousand fifteen twice and one thousand two on one thousand twenty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Mr. Johnson raised his left foot.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A Preliminary Breath Test was offered to Mr. Johnson on the scene. Mr. Johnson was advised that the test was not admissible in court. Mr. Johnson was also advised that the preliminary breath test was an additional test given to the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. Mr. Johnson agreed to submit to the preliminary breath test which indicated a result of .13 BrAC.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ARREST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Based on my training, knowledge, and experience acquired from the Maryland State Police and prior DUI arrests, I placed Mr. Johnson under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 0102 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr. Johnson was transported to the Maryland State Police Annapolis Barrack &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; for further processing. I administered the 20 minute observation period. During the 20 minute observation period, I did not observe Mr. Johnson belching, regurgitating, or ingesting anything. While at the barrack Mr. Johnson stated, &amp;quot;I know, I shouldn&amp;#39;t been driving.&amp;quot; At 0131 hours, the DR-15 Advice of Rights was read to Mr. Johnson via the MVA audio recording English. Mr. Johnson agreed to submit to a chemical breathalyzer with the results of .14 BRAC. The test was administered by Cpl. Higgins #4518 (Intoximeter ID 2455) of the Annapolis City Police Department.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mr. Johnson was given a DR-15, Citations, and DR-15A (Officer&amp;#39;s Certification and Order of Suspension). Mr. Johnson driver&amp;rsquo;s license was confiscated and sent to MVA.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DISCHARGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Mr. Johnson was released from the Annapolis barrack to his girlfriend Devonia Lee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
