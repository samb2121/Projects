He was not breathing or responsive; therefore, he called 911. He last saw Robertson last night (02/21/2023) around 11:00 p.m. He explained that Robertson was obviously high or drunk at the time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Next of Kin:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Robertson, Diane Sue (W/F/12/16/1963)&lt;br /&gt; 2529 Hanover Pike&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Hampstead, MD 21074&lt;br /&gt; 667-221-2469&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Next of Kin Statement:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On February 22, 2023, Diane Robertson explained that she last saw Robert last night around 9:00 p.m. He had woken her up asking when Walmart opened in the morning, so he could get cigarettes. She noticed that he was high, and she knows him to use painkillers and &amp;quot;crack.&amp;quot; The only medical condition he was known to have been high blood pressure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Narrative:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On February 22, 2023, I (TFC Eckhardt #6469) was on duty and in uniform when at approximately 0637 hours, I was dispatched to 2529 Hanover Pike for a reported cardiac arrest.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon my arrival, I observed Paramedics to be inside a detached garage which is located behind the residence. I observed a white male laying supine on the floor of the garage. The male was identified by his Maryland ID Card as Robert Dwayne Robertson. At the time, EMS was doing chest compressions and other life-saving attempts. The bucket which Robertson was squatting over, was moved by EMS. I observed the contents of the bucket which were only rusted tools.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Also in the garage was Larry Holton. I obtained the above statement from Holton.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While EMS was still working on Robertson, I made contact with his wife, Diane Robertson, who was inside the residence. She provided the above statement as well. She also provided me the medications that Robertson takes daily. The medications consisted of Lisinopril 20mg, Duloxetine 20mg, and Oxycodone 10mg. The bottle of Oxycodone was empty; however, it was filled on 02/17/2023 with 12 pills. The instructions on the bottle advised to take one by mouth every six hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Based on Holton and Robertson&amp;#39;s statements, Robert Robertson was last seen alive on 02/21/2023 around 2300 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At 0717 hours, Paramedic Prolux (0124984) called a time of death for Robertson. All life-saving efforts were ineffective. EMS Report Number 23-003369.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I notified the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack of the priority 4 time and requested the on-call Forensic Investigator to respond. MSP Criminal Enforcement Division was also notified and advised they were responding.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I observed the tan Carhart Jacket that EMS had removed from Robertson. While checking the jacket, I located his black Samsung cellular phone. I placed the phone into airplane mode. I also located two silver spoons; both of which did not have any residue or scorch marks, and a piece of steel wool. A single US $100 bill was located in his jacket pocket, which was given to Diane Robertson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I conducted a search immediately around the deceased for any evidence of overdose or cause of death. I did not immediately observe any CDS or paraphernalia. I also check the propane tanks and propane space heater. All items were turned off and covered in dust; therefore, the cause of death was not suspected to be asphyxiation from an outside source.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FI Millender arrived at scene. FI Millender and I photographed the detached garage and the deceased. Upon arrival of D/Sgt. Knight, the deceased was rolled over for examination of the back. There were no obvious signs of trauma or fowl play on the deceased. While searching the pants pocket of the deceased, a small green plastic &amp;quot;trash can,&amp;quot; which contained CDS residue, and a silver 11 millimeter socket, which contained burnt CDS residue, was located. These items were found in his front right pants pocket.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FI Millender requested Mid Atlantic Transport Services to respond, who eventually took custody of the deceased and transported him to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All money located within the deceased clothing was provided to Diane Robertson. D/Sgt. Knight interviewed all parties on scene, please refer to his supplement for further.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I returned to the Westminster Barrack where I documented, packaged, and placed the &amp;quot;trash can,&amp;quot; socket, and Samsung Phone (IMEI 358997696470307) into evidence, all in accordance with Maryland State Police Policy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I respectfully request this case to remain open pending the report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;LIST OF ATTACHMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; None&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DECEASED:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ROBERTSON, Robert Dwayne&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; w / m 11/01/1965&amp;nbsp; 5-10 / 185&lt;br /&gt; 2529 Hanover Pike&lt;br /&gt; Hampstead, MD 21074&lt;br /&gt; MD Soundex: 10272007998&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ACTION TAKEN:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On February 22, 2023 at approximately 0825 hours, I responded to 2529 Hanover Pike in Hampstead, Maryland in reference to a death investigation.&amp;nbsp; Upon my arrival, I was met by Trooper First Class Eckhardt of the Westminster Barrack, and Mr. Jake Millender of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.&amp;nbsp; They led me to the location of the deceased, who was located in a detached garage at the rear of the residence.&amp;nbsp; Tfc. Eckhardt had already obtained the Maryland Driver&amp;#39;s License of the deceased, which identified him as Robert Dwayne Robertson (w/m 11/01/1965).&amp;nbsp; Robertson was laying on his back on the floor of the garage, and was shirtless with electrodes/pads on his torso that had been left by the EMTs that responded to the residence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;An examination of the body revealed no trauma, and there were signs of lividity in the head and neck area.&amp;nbsp; A search of Robertson&amp;#39;s pockets revealed a small green plastic container, commonly referred to as a &amp;quot;trash can,&amp;quot; containing CDS residue, and a socket with burnt steel wool also containing burnt CDS residue.&amp;nbsp; Robertson&amp;#39;s cell phone was located in a coat pocket nearby.&amp;nbsp; All items of interest were taken by Tfc. Eckhardt for processing.&amp;nbsp; The cell phone will be held pending a download, and Sergeant Hodgin of CED Narcotics North was notified and will be retrieving the phone on February 23rd.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW OF DIANE ROBERTSON:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I spoke with Diane Sue Robertson, who is the wife of Robertson.&amp;nbsp; Diane told me that she and Robertson have been married for 20 years, and Robertson has always struggled with substance issues.&amp;nbsp; Robertson struggled with alcohol when he was younger, and moved to drugs later on.&amp;nbsp; Diane said that Robertson had chronic back and shoulder pain from falling off of a roof.&amp;nbsp; He was prescribed Oxycodone by his physician for pain management.&amp;nbsp; The prescription is for 12 pills a week, but he commonly ran out early and bought pills and crack off of the street.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Diane told me that Robertson and her had ice cream at approximately 2000 hours the previous night, which is a daily routine for them.&amp;nbsp; Diane and Robertson had an argument because Robertson was &amp;quot;acting off,&amp;quot; and she believed Robertson was high.&amp;nbsp; Later in the evening, after Diane had gone to sleep, Robertson woke her up asking what time Wal-Mart opened up because he needed cigarettes.&amp;nbsp; Diane could not say what time that was, but found his behavior to be odd.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Diane described Robertson as a kind man who was her primary caregiver.&amp;nbsp; Diane currently suffers from COPD and cancer.&amp;nbsp; She also said that Robertson took care of his elderly parents by cutting the grass, carrying bags of pellets, and other chores around their house.&amp;nbsp; Robertson would take care of his parents when nobody else in the family would.&amp;nbsp; Diane wanted it known that even though Robertson sounded like a horrible person due to his substance abuse issues, he was actually a kind and caring person.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW OF LARRY HOLTON:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I next spoke with Larry Holton at the residence who is Robertson&amp;#39;s friend and landlord.&amp;nbsp; Holton said he had last seen Robertson the previous night at around 2300 hours.&amp;nbsp; Robertson was in the kitchen of the residence cooking something in the crock pot.&amp;nbsp; Holton said that Robertson appeared high to him, and kept knocking items over in the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; Holton said that he has told Robertson to go to bed due to him being high.&amp;nbsp; After Holton went to bed, he heard Robertson in the kitchen several times during the night knocking items over.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At 0624 hours, Holton woke up to the sound of a truck.&amp;nbsp; Holton knew the exact time because he checked his clock immediately upon waking.&amp;nbsp; He recognized the truck as belonging to Ed Redifer who picks up Robertson for work each day, and pulls up to the house right outside of Holton&amp;#39;s bedroom.&amp;nbsp; Holton did find the time to be odd because Redifer does not usually pick up Robertson until 0730 to 0800 hours.&amp;nbsp; Holton stayed in his bed, but didn&amp;#39;t hear anybody moving in the house, and didn&amp;#39;t hear anybody get out of the truck.&amp;nbsp; After a few minutes, Holton got up to look for Robertson.&amp;nbsp; Holton found all the lights on in the hallways, but did not find Robertson where he normally sleeps, or anywhere else in the house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Holton looked outside and saw the truck was gone, but noticed all of the yard lights were one.&amp;nbsp; Holton recalled thinking that Robertson never could turn any lights off and routinely left lights on.&amp;nbsp; He went outside to turn the lights off, and when he got to the garage he saw Robertson in the garage.&amp;nbsp; He said that Robertson was crouched over a bucket and had a lighter in his hand.&amp;nbsp; Holton went into the garage to see if Robertson was okay, and saw that his entire head was purple.&amp;nbsp; Holton shook Robertson, and got no response.&amp;nbsp; Holton said that he knew that Robertson was dead, but called 911.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;According to Holton, Robertson has had a substance abuse problem for many years, and Holton even saved his life once.&amp;nbsp; Holton said that Robertson and Redifer worked together, but also bought drugs together.&amp;nbsp; He told me that Robertson would go through his prescribed oxycodone quickly, and would buy more off the streets or would buy other stuff.&amp;nbsp; Holton said that he repeatedly told Robertson that he needed to get off the drugs or it would kill him.&amp;nbsp; Holton also suffers from chronic back pain and is prescribed Oxycodone for pain management.&amp;nbsp; He had to hide his prescription throughout the house to keep Robertson from stealing his pills, but Robertson had found the hiding places in the past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW OF ROY EDWARD &amp;quot;ED&amp;quot; REDIFER:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I contacted Redifer by telephone.&amp;nbsp; Redifer and Robertson worked together in home improvement and had been friends since about 1993.&amp;nbsp; Robertson has had a substance abuse problem since Redifer met him, saying that Robertson likes to drink and to get high.&amp;nbsp; Robertson called on February 22nd at 0603 hours asking what time Redifer was going to pick him up.&amp;nbsp; Redifer responded that he was coming at the normal time; between 0700 and 0730.&amp;nbsp; Robertson said that he needed cigarettes and wanted Redifer to come and pick him up.&amp;nbsp; Redifer went to the residence, parked in the driveway, and called Robertson to let him know he was there.&amp;nbsp; There was no answer to the phone call, and Redifer attempted to call Robertson a total of 7 to 8 times.&amp;nbsp; After not receiving an answer, Redifer left the residence because Robertson had mentioned that he had been up half the night.&amp;nbsp; Redifer believed Robertson went to bed and was blowing off work for the day, which is not unusual behavior.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Redifer admitted to driving Robertson to get drugs in the past.&amp;nbsp; According to Redifer, he has only driven Robertson to get pills, but not crack or any other hard drugs because Redifer did not want Robertson doing hard drugs.&amp;nbsp; Robertson used the same person to get pills all the time, a female that Redifer claims not to know the name of.&amp;nbsp; Redifer believes that her number is saved in Robertson&amp;#39;s cell phone.&amp;nbsp; Redifer doesn&amp;#39;t know the exact address where he has taken Robertson, but said he would be willing to take somebody to show it to them.&amp;nbsp; He described the location as an upstairs apartment located in an alley behind the bank in Manchester, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The information provided by Redifer has been forwarded to CED Narcotics North for follow up and validation.&amp;nbsp; Also, it should be noted that the cell phone seized from Robertson for download is to be returned to Larry Holton.&amp;nbsp; Holton had given the phone to Robertson and would like it back.&amp;nbsp; Diane Robertson agreed that the phone should be returned to Larry Holton.&amp;nbsp; The Medical Examiner Case Number for this incident is 23-02464.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case remains open pending autopsy results to be retrieved by Tfc. Eckhardt.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
