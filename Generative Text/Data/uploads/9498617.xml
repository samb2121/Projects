I responded immediately from the Westminster Barrack to assist. While traveling eastbound on MD Route 140, I observed a blue Jeep with its flashers on, that appeared to be stopped in lane two of MD Route 140 westbound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I used the cross-over just east of the landfill to turn around and when I came over the hill I observed the vehicle traveling westbound on MD Route 140. I observed the vehicle weaving in lane one and then changed lanes from lane one to the left turn lane without signaling. When the vehicle turned to go eastbound on MD Route 140, I observed a cell phone in the right hand of the driver, and it appeared as though he was talking to someone on speaker. The vehicle failed to use its turn signal when it turned right into the Sheetz parking lot located at 1023 Baltimore Blvd, in Westminster Carroll County Maryland. The vehicle then pulled into a parking spot and I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Contact (Phase II)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I made contact with the driver at the driver side window and identified myself. I explained the reason for the traffic stop to the driver and advised that driver the traffic stop was being recorded. I also observed that the driver parked in a parking spot that states, no trucks or SUV&amp;rsquo;s and was for passenger cars only. The driver advised that he was looking for his husband. I asked if his husband was in danger, and he advised that he was not. The driver&amp;#39;s speech was slurred, and his eyes were bloodshot and glassy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle and when I asked the driver if he had anything to drink, he advised &amp;ldquo; I did, I did earlier&amp;rdquo; at a friend&amp;#39;s house. I requested the driver exit the vehicle and when he did he lost his balance and nearly fell backwards, catching himself before falling.&amp;nbsp; I continued to detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his person and requested he perform Standardized Field Sobriety, to which he agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre Arrest Screening:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mr. Wyatt was asked the following questions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About how long ago was your last drink? He advised about an hour or two ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What do you typically drink? Mixed drinks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glasses or contacts? &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. He advised he was wearing them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gum, fake teeth or dentures? &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medications? &amp;ldquo;Yes, a few&amp;rdquo;. He did not specify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Injuries? None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;He swayed to his front and back while speaking with me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)-&amp;nbsp;6/6&amp;nbsp;clues observed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I instructed Mr. Wyatt to look at the tip of my pen. &amp;nbsp;I then requested Mr. Wyatt stand with his feet together and to place his hands down at his side. I advised Mr. Wyatt that I was going to shine my flash light on the side of his face, to see his eyes. I advised him that I was going to check his eyes and I asked Mr. Wyatt if he could see my pen, and he advised that he could. I advised him to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes and not to move his head. I observed Mr. Wyatt swayed to his front and back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resting Nystagmus- not present&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Equal Pupil size-both pupils were the same size&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Equal tracking-both eyes displayed equal tracking&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lack of Smooth Pursuit-&amp;nbsp;Present&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation-&amp;nbsp;Present&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees-&amp;nbsp;Present&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Walk and Turn (WAT)- 6/8&amp;nbsp;clues observed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I asked Mr. Wyatt to use the parking spot white line to help him with this test. The area was well lit and free from debris. I asked Mr. Wyatt to place his left foot on that line and to place his right foot in front of it, heel touching toe and to remain in that position, until I told him to begin. &amp;nbsp;He got into position and began walking while I was trying to explain the test. I asked him to get back into position. He had difficulty maintaining the instructional position and then stood with two feet together while I finished explaining the test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mr. Wyatt was advised that he would be taking nine heel touching toe steps on the line, turn while keeping his lead foot planted and to take nine more heel touching toe steps. He was told to keep his hands down at his side, look at his feet and to count his steps out loud. He was then advised that if he stepped off-line at any point, he was to get back into position and to continue the test until completed. He advised that he understood the test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Instructional phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;1.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starts too soon&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;2.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;Cannot keep balance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walking phase:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;3.). Missed heel to toe contact - Mr. Wyatt Missed heel to toe contact on steps three, four, five, six, eight and nine of the first nine steps. Mr. Wyatt missed heel touching toe contact on all steps of the second nine (he took ten) steps. The second nine steps were large steps (nearly a foot).&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;4). Improper turn &amp;ndash; Turned around with feet together, not as demonstrated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;5.) Stops walking-Turned and stared at me after the turn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;6.) Improper number of steps - Mr. Wyatt took ten total steps.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;One Leg Stand (OLS)- 2/4&amp;nbsp;clues observed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mr. Wyatt was requested to place his feet together and to keep his hands down at his side. I advised Mr. Wyatt that when he was told to begin, he would raise, whichever foot he chooses, approximately six inches off the ground, keep his legs straight, point his toe and would be counting in one thousand. He was advised that if he put his foot down, he was to pick it back up and continue where he left off, until I advised him to stop. Mr. Wyatt acknowledged that he understood. He raised his right foot and balance on his left (He was wearing sneakers). He then said that he had a question but had difficulty forming a sentence, and again I noticed his speech was slurred. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1). Swayed - Mr. Wyatt to his left and right - Within the first 10 seconds. Approximately on second five.&lt;br /&gt; 2). Put foot down &amp;ndash; Mr. Wyatt put his foot down within approximately five seconds, raised his foot again and put it down again, crossing his right foot in front of his left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It should be noted that Mr. Wyatt had difficulty counting properly. &amp;ldquo;Three thousand, four One thousand four, five one thousand, four one thousand.&amp;rdquo; Losing track of where he was while counting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mr. Wyatt was offered the preliminary breath test, and he refused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mr. Wyatt was placed under arrest at approximately 0340 hours for driving under the influence of alcohol. I observed two drinking containers in the middle console. When I picked up the open one, it had liquid inside and I detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from it. Mr. Wyatt advised that it was not his, and it was Tennessee Honey, which is an alcoholic cocktail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mr.Wyatt was transported to the Maryland State Police Westminster barrack.
