         <NarrativeText>This stop was audibly and visually recorded on my BWC utilizing the Axon Digital Recording system. This incident was also captured on TFC Bauer&amp;rsquo;s #6719 and S/T Rucker&amp;#39;s #6120 BWC.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Defendant: Wills, Tito Xavier&lt;br /&gt; Date of Birth: 08/10/1975&lt;br /&gt; Date of Arrest: 08/18/23&lt;br /&gt; Time of Arrest: 2242&lt;br /&gt; License#: MD-10272287498&lt;br /&gt; DUI #: 23-072&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)&lt;br /&gt; On August 18th, 2023 at approximately 2219 hours, S/T Rucker #6120 observed a Gray Ford Fusion bearing Maryland registration &amp;quot;8FH8406;&amp;quot; operating S/B on MD Rt. 4 in the area Nursey Lane, Lusby, Calvert County, Maryland failing to maintain its lane. Please refer to S/T Ruckers&amp;#39; supplemental report for further details of the stop. TFC Bauer #6719 and I responded to assist S/T Rucker at 2227 hours and took over the investigation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)&lt;br /&gt; I made contact with the driver of the vehicle, later identified by his Maryland license as, Tito Xavier Wills, (B/M, DOB: 08/10/1975). While speaking with Wills, I immediately detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. I also observed Wills&amp;rsquo; eyes to be glassy and his speech to be heavily slurred. Wills walked to the front of S/T Rucker&amp;rsquo;s vehicle where Standardized Field Sobriety Tests were administered.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)&lt;br /&gt; The evaluation was performed on the side of the road, adjacent to the traffic stop. The surface was dry, level, and free of any debris. The lighting conditions consisted of the streetlights as well as my flashlight. When Wills was asked about any pre-existing medical conditions, injuries, or if he took any medication, he replied that he had some pain in his knee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (6/6 clues observed)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test&amp;#39;s stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Wills&amp;rsquo; eyes. Wills was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. The following clues were observed:&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - present in right and left eye.&lt;br /&gt; 2.) Distinct and sustained Nystagmus at maximum deviation-present in right and left eye.&lt;br /&gt; 3.) Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees-present in right and left eye.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walk And Turn (7/8 clues observed)&lt;br /&gt; Prior to Wills performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Wills was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Wills was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin. Wills was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line, touching heel to toe on every step. Wills was to keep his hands flat at his sides, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Wills was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Wills was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Wills was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keeping his hands down by his side, looking down at his feet, and counting each step out loud. Wills stated that he understood the instructions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Instructional Stage:&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Wills could not maintain balance during instructional stage and fell off balance multiple times as I demonstrated the Walk and Turn Test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walking Stage (1st Nine):&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Wills took 15 steps then paused and took 4 more steps until reaching the back of his car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; 2.) Wills stepped off-line at step (15)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walking Stage (2nd Nine):&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Misses heal-to-toe (1,3,4)&lt;br /&gt; 2.) Use arms to balance (4)&lt;br /&gt; 3.) Stops walking at step 4 and restarts&lt;br /&gt; 4.) Wills took 16 steps instead of 9&lt;br /&gt; 5.)&amp;nbsp;Steps off-line (16) Wills stepped off-line and stumbled towards the roadway. At this time, the test was stopped for safety precautions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Turn:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Wills did not follow instructions for the turn. Wills turned the opposite way that he was instructed to do so and he failed to keep one foot planted during the turn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One Leg Stand (3/4 clues observed)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Prior to Wills performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Wills was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the&amp;nbsp;instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, keep his hands at his sides, to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two), and to continue the test until told to stop. Wills stated he understood the instructions. Hill then lifted his left leg.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Instructional Stage:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Nothing to report&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Balance and Count Stage:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Seconds 0-10:&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Foot touches the ground (7)&lt;br /&gt; 2.) Use arms to balance (4)&lt;br /&gt; 3.) Swaying (entire test)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Seconds 11-20:&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Foot touches ground (13)&lt;br /&gt; 2.) Swaying (entire time)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Seconds 21-30:&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Foot touches ground (25)&lt;br /&gt; 2.) Swaying (entire test)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A preliminary breath test was offered to Wills, and he stated he was not going to take the test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ARREST&lt;br /&gt; Based on the following, I had reason to believe Wills was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *Inability to travel within his lane&lt;br /&gt; *Heavily slurred speech.&lt;br /&gt; *Clues observed during the standardized field sobriety tests.&lt;br /&gt; *Glassy eyes.&lt;br /&gt; *Lethargic movements. While getting out of the vehicle, Hill moved very slowly as he walked to the back of th ecar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; *Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person.&lt;br /&gt; *Admission to drinking alcohol. Hill stated that he had two drinks at the Tiki Bar in Solomons Island.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Wills was advised he was being placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at 2242 hours. After being placed into my vehicle, TFC Bauer conducted a search incident to arrest of the vehicle. He observed a &amp;ldquo;handle&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;Titos&amp;quot; vodka on the back passenger side floorboard of the vehicle. The bottle had been opened and was approximately 1/3 of the way empty. He also observed a plastic cup in the center console containing an unknown mixed drink. Wills was read the DR-15, Advice of Rights, in English via the MVA website. At the conclusion of reading the DR-15, Wills refused to take the breath test at 2307 hours. Wills was then transported to the Calvert County Detention Center where he was held pending contact with the Commissioner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed by arrest.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This stop was audibly and visually recorded on using the Axon Digital Video Camera System assigned to Maryland State Police Unit, U-10 and Axon Digital Body Camera System assigned to Senior Trooper N. Rucker #6120.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;DUI #: 23-072&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maryland Soundex: MD-10272287498&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On August 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2023, at approximately 2215 hours, I, Senior Trooper Rucker #6120, was on patrol in my marked MSP patrol unit U-10, in the area of northbound Route 4 approaching Cove Point Road, Lusby, Calvert County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I was traveling northbound in lane #1, I observed a dark colored passenger vehicle ahead of me in lane # 2 swerve partially onto the shoulder, with the passenger side tires crossing over the white line, after the vehicle proceeded through the light at Cove Point Road. I then observed the vehicle continue to swerve/drift out of its lane and onto the shoulder multiple times. As we approached the side road for Calvert Cliff&amp;rsquo;s State Park, the vehicle moved partially into the turn lane, as if it was going to turn but did not. The vehicle then straddled the line for the turn lane and for lane #2, blocking the passage of vehicles on both sides. There was another vehicle traveling behind it, which had to slow down and apply its brakes multiple times. The vehicle then proceeded to drive partially on the shoulder before returning to lane #2. The vehicle continued to drift back and forth from lane #2 to partially driving on the shoulder. The vehicle then used its turn signal and went from lane #2 to lane #1, after changing lanes the vehicle then straddled the dotted line between lane #1 and lane #2, swerving back and forth before correcting itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to the observed above driving behavior, I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the gray Ford Taurus bearing Maryland &amp;ldquo;8FH8406&amp;rdquo;. The vehicle stopped northbound Route 4 at the south entrance to Nursery Road, Lusby, Calvert County, Maryland. I made a driver side approach and made contact with the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle. Upon contact with the driver, I identified myself and informed him of the reason for the stop. As I was talking to the driver, I observed there was a plastic cup in the center console containing a yellow liquid, ice and a straw. I also noticed the driver&amp;rsquo;s eyes were glassy, and there was a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the open window of the vehicle. As the driver was retrieving his identification from his wallet, I noticed his hand movements were very slow and methodical, as if he had to seriously concentrate on the task. It took the driver several times to retrieve his driver&amp;rsquo;s license out of his wallet, at which time he was identified as, Tito Xavier Wills, B/M, DOB: 8/10/1975. As Wills spoke I noticed his speech was slightly slurred and I observed the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. I asked the Wills where he was coming from and he advised &amp;ldquo;Tiki&amp;rdquo;, referencing the Tiki Bar, 85 Charles St, Solomons, Calvert County, Maryland. I asked if he was going by to the address on his license and he advised he was, the address on his license was in Hyattsville, Maryland. I asked Wills how much he had to drink that night and he advised two drinks at the bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through my training, knowledge and experience in the Maryland State Police, and from previous impaired driving arrests, I noticed several indicators of an impaired driver. Upon returning to my vehicle, I requested Tpr Sivic (U16A) and TFC Bauer (U-16) &amp;nbsp;to respond to my location. Upon their arrival, I informed them of my observations, and Tpr Sivic went to make contact with the driver. After making contact with Wills, Tpr Sivic asked the driver to exit the vehicle to perform voluntary Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFSTs), at which Wills agreed to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I stood by as a secondary unit, until Tpr Sivic conducted his SFSTs, and at the conclusion arrested Wills for driving under the influence of alcohol. Upon securing Wills&amp;rsquo; vehicle for him, I was able to confirm the beverage in the center console cup did have the odor of an alcoholic beverage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This concludes my assistance in this investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
