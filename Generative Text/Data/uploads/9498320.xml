         <NarrativeText>Reporting: CAR B-5 // TFC CARR // Body worn Camera not available // In-Car Camera not available&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 23-MSP-016906&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Complainant:&lt;br /&gt; Mario MANALDI (VCC Staff)&lt;br /&gt; Richard D KUNKEL Jr. (VCC Staff)&lt;br /&gt; Ms. A. MOREFIELD (VCC Staff)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Involved Person(s):&lt;br /&gt; Shanna Nicole DUVALL (VCC Student)&lt;br /&gt; Kimora CRAPPER (VCC Student)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Possible Witness(es):&lt;br /&gt; Brianna WHITE (VCC Student)&lt;br /&gt; Haleigh Marie TACKETT (VCC Student)&lt;br /&gt; Trania Jackson DYNASTY (VCC Student)&lt;br /&gt; Amoni HICKMAN (VCC Student)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 5/12/23 at approximately 1300 hours I, Tfc. Carr #6935, spoke to Mario MANALDI, the assistant Superintendent at the Victor Cullen Center (VCC) in the education wing of VCC. MANALDI advised the previous evening at about 2015 hours one of the female students had alleged an assault/unwanted touching had been reported by Shanna Nicole DUVALL.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; (see attached VCC Incident Reporting Form)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There was no physical contact injury reported in the incident. No medical attention was required for anyone involved. In summary, DUVALL stated on 5/4/23 at approximately 1030 hours she was groped by Kimora CRAPPER in the exercise room. DUVALL stated other students Brianna WHITE, Haleigh TACKETT, Trania DYNASTY and Amoni HICKMAN were touching each other in the same location.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;After speaking with the assistant superintendent I believed the statement made by DUVALL may be a fabrication. MANALDI advised the exercise room where the physical contact was alleged had been secured on 5/3/23 through 5/5/23. MANALDI advised he could provide CCTV footage corroborating the lack of possible access to the exercise room. Additionally according to the VCC report DUVALL claims she called 211 on 5/4/23 after the physical contact. MANALDI confirmed that no 211 Call had been made from VCC phone lines. MANALDI additionally contacted the 211 call center and no contact was made with DUVALL.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be forwarded to the Criminal Enforcement Division.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All the above events occurred in Frederick County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

Assistant Superintendent&amp;nbsp;Monaldi also advised that Duvall had expressed how she was going to file a Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) against Crapper, given Crapper was alleged to be filing a PREA against Duvall.&amp;nbsp;Assistant Superintendent&amp;nbsp;Monaldi also advised that Duvall has filed false allegations against staff and youth in the past.&amp;nbsp;Assistant Superintendent&amp;nbsp;Monaldi further provided that the youth did not have access to the&amp;nbsp;Exercise Room of the Gymnasium on the date of the allegations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Assistant Superintendent&amp;nbsp;Monaldi provided an interview room for S/Tpr. Burleson and I to conduct interviews.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The forthcoming interviews were recorded on a departmentally issued Sony IC Recorder.

When asked I showed White an image of Crapper, White advised that she did not know Crapper. White denied any misconduct against her and could not provide any investigative leads in the case.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At approximately 1151 hours, S/Tpr.

Hickman acknowledged that the youth sometimes have access to the Exercise Room in the Gymnasium.&amp;nbsp;Hickman denied having access to the&amp;nbsp;Exercise Room on 4/27/2023 or 5/8/2023. When asked if Hickman had anything further to advise, she advised she did and went on to say that Duvall would write Crapper letter detailing how Duvall wished for Crapper to touch her &amp;quot;sexually&amp;quot;. Hickman also provided that Duvall was filing PREA on Crapper, because Crapper intended to file PREA on Duvall. Hickman advised that she has known both Duvall and Crapper through detention. Hickman alleged that Duvall was going to file PREA on her as well. Hickman went on to advise that Duvall expressed to Crapper how she wanted Crapper to be her girlfriend as well as how Duvall wished for Crapper to touch on her.

Hickman advised that Crapper told Hickman that Crapper did not like Duvall and that Crapper thought Duvall was ugly and that Crapper thought Duvall looked like a boy.

Hickman added that Duvall makes her feel uncomfortable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; After the interviews concluded, S/Tpr. Burleson and I responded to&amp;nbsp;Assistant Superintendent&amp;nbsp;Monaldi&amp;#39;s Office. I requested to review video surveillance of the Gymnasium on 5/8/2023 and 4/27/2023 from approximately 1030 hours to 1130 hours, which Assistant Superintendent&amp;nbsp;Monaldi assisted with. During a review of the surveillance on 4/27/2023, youth did not have access to the Exercise Room of the Gymnasium. During a review of the surveillance on 5/8/2023, youth did have access to the Exercise Room of the Gymnasium. Further review provided that&amp;nbsp;youth, including Duvall and Crapper, as well as Ms. Goins can be seen in the Gymnasium. Later in the video, youth, including Duvall and Crapper can be seen gaining access to the Exercise Room, while&amp;nbsp;Ms. Goins supervises.&amp;nbsp;Ms. Goins can be seen sitting on the edge of the Gymnasium bleachers, closest to the Exercise Room, allowing her to observe the youth. While monitoring the youth, Ms. Goins walks to retrieve a log book, which took minor seconds to retrieve, and she continued to monitor the youth in the&amp;nbsp;Exercise Room. Due to the angle of the video surveillance system, I was unable to see directly into the Exercise Room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Due to the facts provided above, the case is being &lt;strong&gt;CLOSED&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Unfounded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case Status: &lt;strong&gt;CLOSED&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Unfounded&lt;/strong&gt;</NarrativeText>
