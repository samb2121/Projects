Incident was NOT captured on camera.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; DECEASED INFORMATION:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Kenneth Chantone Manokey (9/9/1959)&lt;br /&gt; 804 Allen St.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Cambridge, MD 21613&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NEXT OF KIN:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lanot Darnell Manokey (11/19/1953)&lt;br /&gt; 804 Allen St.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Cambridge, MD 21613&lt;br /&gt; 443-515-0941&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; WITNESS: (EMPLOYER)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Terry Lee Groves (3/25/1949)&lt;br /&gt; 1566 Taylors Island Rd.&lt;br /&gt; Woolford, MD 21677&lt;br /&gt; 410-463-3189&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bart Cohee (443-786-0263)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Digital photographs were obtained of the deceased and the approximate location the deceased collapsed as well as the boat he was working on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ATTACHMENTS:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. Groves written statement.&lt;br /&gt; 2. MSP Form 89B.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On Friday, July 28, 2023 at approximately 1110 hours, I, TFC. Meekins was dispatched to 4362 Bay Shore Road Taylors Island, MD 21669 for an unattended death. I arrived at that location and made contact with Dorchester Paramedic 500. I spoke with Paramedic Wells in regard to an unknown black male that had been found unresponsive. Wells advised that the subject had been out crabbing that morning and when he arrived back to the dock he passed out. Wells advised his employer call 911 and began CPR to the best of their ability. Wells advised they arrived on scene and moved the subject into the ambulance due to being on the gravel and the extreme heat conditions we were under that afternoon. Wells advised that they attempted CPR for approximately 30 minutes before calling the time of death at 11:40 am. Very little information was available with regard to the deceased or his employer as the employer left the scene to make contact with the deceased&amp;#39;s brother. Wells did advise the employer&amp;#39;s name was Terry and did provide a phone number. That information was forwarded to the MSP Easton Barrack. The deceased was then transported to the University of Maryland Dorchester location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While en route to the University of Maryland Dorchester location the MSP Easton Barrack contacted the employer via telephone. They were able to identify the deceased, Kenneth Chantone Manokey (9/9/1959), and the full information of the employer. The employer was instructed to make contact with myself at the University of Maryland Dorchester location. Upon arriving at the&amp;nbsp;University of Maryland Dorchester location, I made contact with the forensic investigator, Bart Cohee, who was provided with all the information we obtained about Manokey. Cohee completed his examination and made arrangements for Manokey to be transported to the Medical Examiner&amp;#39;s office in Baltimore for further autopsy due to the unknown cause of death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then contacted the employer, Terry Lee Groves (3/25/1949). Groves advised that Manokey seemed to be fine while they were out crabbing, &amp;quot;we have water and Gatorade on the boat, and he was drinking&amp;quot;. Groves advised they came in early due to the extreme heat. Groves advised that when they got back to the dock, they were going to put some brake fluid in his truck, Groves advised that Manokey got the bottle of brake fluid and handed it to him. Groves advised that is when Manokey fell out. Groves advised they called 911 and began CPR. Groves advised they even put a bag of ice on his head in case it was heat stroke. Groves advised they did CPR the best they could until the ambulance got there. Groves advised he left shortly after the ambulance got there to go and inform Manokey&amp;#39;s family of what had happened. Groves advised he made contact with Manokey&amp;#39;s brother, Lanot Darnell Manokey, and advised him of the situation. The Cambridge Police Department was sent to Manokey&amp;#39;s residence to make the death notification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events did occur in Dorchester County.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
