         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on body-worn camera.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; On March 19th, 2023, at approximately 0425 hours, I, Trooper Larimer #7397 was on duty, in uniform, on patrol, when I was dispatched to 23569 Mervell Dean Rd, Hollywood, St. Mary&amp;#39;s County, MD 20636 to assist The St. Mary&amp;#39;s County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office with a subject who had an active warrant through the Maryland State Police. The warrant was confirmed to be active prior to my arrival.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At approximately 0426 hours, I arrived on scene and made contact with Deputy Marsch #397, Deputy Edelen #330, and Deputy Ocasio #413, who advised they had already made contact with the subject, identified as Laryssa Jean Wall (DOB 01/01/1996.) Wall was advised she had an active warrant and would be placed under arrest upon my arrival. I was advised that Wall was uncooperative, and refused to give her full name. I was advised that she had a confirmed warrant through the Maryland State Police for Assault - Second Degree. I positioned my patrol vehicle to the left of Wall&amp;#39;s vehicle, while a deputy parked their vehicle in front of her and behind her, to prevent Wall from attempting to drive away.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I made contact with Wall, who was crying and irate. Wall was already advised of the warrant but did not believe she had one, and continued to ask to see it. Wall was advised she needed to exit the vehicle she was in. Wall continued to interrupt and say that she did not care and that she was not going anywhere. Wall was asked to turn her vehicle off, and upon being asked, rolled her driver side window up and locked the doors. Wall continued to yell in the vehicle that she did not have a warrant, and then rolled her driver&amp;#39;s side window down to ask what the second degree assault charge was for. I advised Wall that she would have a copy of the warrant but she had to exit the vehicle. Wall said that she would not be going anywhere, and that she was being falsely accused. Wall took her seat belt off and continued to yell, &amp;quot;what do I have a fucking warrant for,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fucking done with ya&amp;#39;ll,&amp;quot; and continued to state that she was not going anywhere until she could see the warrant. Deputy Hersch unlocked the driver&amp;#39;s side door from the inside and opened the door, to which Wall said &amp;quot;fuck you,&amp;quot; and attempted to pull the door closed. Wall laid back into the vehicle. I grabbed Wall&amp;#39;s right leg and Deputy Ocasio grabbed Wall&amp;#39;s left arm, and were able to bring Wall out of the vehicle. Wall rolled onto her stomach, and while I attempted to handcuff her, she continued to pull her arm in towards her body. Wall continued to ask to see the warrant, and yelled &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t fucking do it, show me the fucking warrant,&amp;quot; multiple times. Deputy Edelen held her left arm behind her back and I held her right arm, and Deputy Marsh placed the handcuffs on Wall. After an active struggle, Wall was placed under arrest.&amp;nbsp;Wall refused to stand up, and had to be lifted by Deputies Marsch and Ocasio. Wall refused to get into Deputy Ocasio&amp;#39;s vehicle, and both deputies needed to push and assist Wall into the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Deputy Edelen asked Wall if she had any injuries and if she needed EMS, to which she answered no. Wall was transported to the St. Mary&amp;#39;s County Detention Center.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Wall was charged with&amp;nbsp;1 0600 Cr, 9-408(B) : Resist/Interfere With Arrest. A copy of the statement of charges is attached to this report.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in St Mary&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
