         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On July 28, 2023 I was on uniformed patrol in unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle S-38. At approximately 1612 hours I was driving northbound on Pine Tree Road near Ashley Lane when I observed a silver Acura (Maryland registration 8EH3282) traveling southbound. As it approached closer, the vehicle appeared to had been traveling at an excessive speed which was verified by my patrol vehicle&amp;#39;s radar unit. I observed the driver to be the sole occupant and was a 1/M wearing a floppy hat and dark-colored shirt. As I began to turn around to initiate a traffic stop, the vehicle rapidly increased its speed. After getting turned around and activating my emergency equipment, the vehicle turned into 322 Pine Tree Road. Due to the distance between us, I was not able to initially approach the vehicle. When I entered the long driveway of 322 Pine Tree Road, I was able to observe the 1/M flee into the nearby wooded area south of the driveway. I exited my patrol vehicle but was extremely far behind the individual. A description of the individual was given out on the radio. A deputy believed he saw the individual and the floppy hat on the ground, but a floppy hat nor the individual were located. The vehicle was later towed to the MSP Centreville Barrack for processing. Contact was made with the owner and her husband who stated they did not know who had the vehicle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Since the above date, the vehicle was released back to its owner. Due to the lack of information for the possible suspect, no processing of the vehicle was completed. I request this case be closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
