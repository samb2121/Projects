         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING: (1) One Maryland State Police Uniform Identity Fraud/ Theft Reporting Form was completed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: (1) One PNC bank statement was attached and uploaded to this report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On March 7, 2023 at approximately 1805 hours, I, Corporal J. Palumbo # 5974 with the Maryland State Police responded to the MSP Prince Frederick Barrack for a reported fraud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I arrived at the Prince Frederick Barrack and made contact with the complainant/ victim, Joanne Elizabeth Shick, W/F, DOB 07/02/1954, who I positively identified by her Maryland Driver&amp;rsquo;s License. Shick advised last Monday (2/27/2023) her bank account was hacked. Shick further elaborated she received a text message from PNC Bank&amp;rsquo;s fraud department, advising there were possible fraudulent charges made utilizing her debit card. Shick advised there were two unauthorized purchases from her PNC Virtual Wallet with Performance Select bank account (X1166), for approximately $6.00 and $89.00. Shick was unsure of the actual amount at the time of this report. Shick recalled the purchases were some &amp;ldquo;gadgets&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Shick advised on March 3, 2023, she received another text message from PNC Bank&amp;rsquo;s fraud department advising there were unauthorized purchases on her account. Shick did not know what the purchases were or the amount. This was later unfounded and there were no unauthorized purchases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On March 7, 2023, at 1628 hours,&amp;nbsp; Shick received a telephone call from a &amp;ldquo;Jack Siglar&amp;rdquo; (410-610-1346), who claimed to be from Amazon.com Inc. &amp;ldquo;Jack Siglar&amp;rdquo; advised Shick there were $1500.00 in charges on Shicks Amazon account that needed to be paid for. &amp;ldquo;Jack Siglar&amp;rdquo; then advised Shick her account was being hacked by Amazon and asked her if she knew about the charges. &amp;ldquo;Jack Siglar&amp;rdquo; then advised he would transfer Shick to the fraud department.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Shick advised a male with an accent came on the telephone. The unknown male told Shick she needed to go to the bank and withdraw $10,000.00. Shick advised the male did not provide a reason why. Shick advised the male was in her night clothes and not dressed to leave the house. The male then told Shick she needed to get dressed and keep him on the telephone. Once Shick was dressed, the male advised Shick to drive to the bank and to keep him on the telephone and not to talk to him during the drive. Once Shick arrived at the bank, she was to let the male know she was there. Shick went to the PNC Bank in the Giant Food located at 11740 Rousby Hall Rd, Lusby, MD 20657.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Once Shick arrived she notified the male. The male advised her to go to the bank, withdraw the $10,000 and not to talk to anyone. Shick advised she went into the bank, but it was busy. While she was standing in line, she kept thinking about what she was doing. Shick advised she was approached by an employee and told them what was happening. The employee advised Shick she was being scammed. While interviewing Shick, she was visibly upset, crying and trying to recall the events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, during the interview, the male called Shick again. Shick answered the telephone and male with a middle eastern accent was speaking. The male asked what happened and said it sounded like the call disconnected. The male asked numerous times, insisting he knew what happened. &amp;nbsp;Shick told the male she did not want to go through with the withdrawal anymore. The male insisted that she get the money and kept asking what happened. I asked Shick to ask what his name is and where he worked. The male advised his name was &amp;ldquo;Jim&amp;rdquo; and he works for the Federal Trade Commission. When Shick told the male, she was not going to go through with this, and it was late, he insisted that she try again tomorrow. Shick disconnected the call. After she disconnected, she received several telephone calls in a row from the same number that the male had called on. On 3/7/2023 (12) twelve telephone calls were made from the male to Shick. The telephone number the male called from was 425-880-5184 from Redmond, Washington.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Shick was showed how to block the cellphone number on her phone. A Maryland State Police Uniform Identity Fraud/ Theft Reporting Form was completed. Shick advised she placed a freeze on her account and that she would be receiving a new card. Shick was asked to provide a bank statement showing the unauthorized charges. &amp;nbsp;Shick later provided her bank statement that showed the following unauthorized purchases:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Posting date- March 1, 2023- debit card purchase- Ardent Joy Gadgets NY- $6.89&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Posting date- March 2, 2023- debit card purchase- Dulce Products Gadgets- $89.90.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These charges were disputed. A follow-up with Shick will be conducted to ensure the charges were reversed.&amp;nbsp;On 3/12/2023, I conducted a LINX query utilizing the telephone number that &amp;ldquo;Jack Siglar&amp;rdquo; had used to call Shick. The telephone number returned to a Jack Siglar of 3610 Clover Drive, Port Republic Maryland. An MVA query was conducted on Jack Siglar, however no results were returned. A Maryland Real Property Search was conducted which revealed the current owner is John Muelbe Siglar. An MVA query was conducted using Siglar&amp;#39;s full name and a DOB of 12/08/1957.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; An alias is listed on John Siglar&amp;rsquo;s driving record of &amp;ldquo;Jack Muelbe Siglar.&amp;rdquo; It was discovered John Siglar has a son named John Muelbe Siglar Jr., W/M, DOB 05/02/1991.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Shick was advised of the case status. Shick was provided an Identity Theft Protection Guide and Identity Theft brochure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case remain open pending further investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since the initial investigation, I researched the business where the fraudulent purchases were made. I could not find any information on &amp;ldquo;Ardent Joy Gadgets NY. However, I located the business &amp;ldquo;Dulce Products Gadgets, where the $89.90, purchase was made at &lt;a href="http://www.dulceproductsgadgets.com" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"&gt;www.dulceproductsgadgets.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dulce Products Gadgets advertises a limited selection of coffee cups, coffee makers and wine glasses, etc, for sale. The contact information for the website states the business has an address of 103 Crest Ave., Glen Burnie MD 21061. The contact telephone number listed on the website is 888-563-2952. I conducted a Maryland Business Entity Search of &amp;ldquo;Dulce Products LLC&amp;rdquo; with Department ID Number W23172067, which returned in Good Standing. The resident agent for the business is Donita Phillips with an address of 103 Crest Ave. Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061. Dulce Products, LLC was formed on August 1, 2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I conducted a LINX query with the telephone number provided on Dulce Products LLC website (888-563-2952). The query revealed a case where the telephone number listed was used in a similar incident on 10/01/2015, and reported through the San Antonio Police Department in Texas (SAPD15212775). In reference to the 2015 incident, the complainant was contacted and advised by an unknown person they were from a travel agency and requested they meet at a certain location with &amp;ldquo;any type of credit cards&amp;rdquo; they had. The complainant did not follow through with the callers request and notified police. It appears no official report was filed with San Antonio Police Department and this was only informational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On April 18, 2023, I made contact with John &amp;ldquo;Jack&amp;rdquo; Siglar. I advised Siglar I was conducting an investigation where his name and telephone number had been used in a possible crime. John Siglar was positively identified and advised of his Miranda Rights, which he waived. I confirmed Silgar&amp;rsquo;s cell phone number, which was in fact his. Siglar advised he does not know Joanne Shick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Siglar advised he does not work for Amazon and works for Morgan Stanley Financial. Siglar stated he is the only person who has access to his cellphone which is password protected. Siglar did not make any telephone calls at the date and time the victim stated she received the telephone call. Siglar has not noticed anything indicating his cellphone was hacked or of any other fraudulent activity. Siglar also advised he has not been a victim of any recent fraud or identity thefts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Siglar reviewed his cellphone call log in front of me, however he stated he deletes old calls and only had recent calls from April 13, 2023. I asked Siglar if there have been any security breaches at his place of employment and he advised there was not. I mentioned to Siglar, I was aware he and his son have the same name. I asked Siglar if he would suspect his son of doing something like this, and he replied &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I requested to receive a copy of Siglar&amp;rsquo;s cellphone log from his carrier. This concluded this interview. On April 19, 2023, Siglar contacted the MSP Prince Frederick Barrack, however, I was not available. Siglar left his employment telephone number, instead of his cellphone number, which is what he was previously contacted on. On April 23, 2023, I contacted Siglar on his cellphone number. Siglar advised he spoke to his Risk Management Office at Morgan Stanley who recommended he be listed as a victim.&amp;nbsp; Siglar also advised he contacted Verizon to verify there were no other outgoing calls from his cellphone, which there was not according to Siglar. Siglar advised he would bring his cellphone logs to the Prince Frederick Barrack on April 24, 2023. At this time, I do not suspect Siglar as a suspect, however, I will not be listing Siglar as a victim until I verify his&amp;nbsp; Verizion cellphone logs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I attempted to contact Shick to advise her of the case status and inquire if the charges were reversed, however there was no answer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Case remains open pending further investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On June 6, 2023, a criminal history check was conducted on Donita Felicia Phillips DOB 06/17/1973, which revealed no criminal history. As of 6/5/2023, the telephone number of Dulce Products LLC (888-563-2952) is no longer in service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I conducted a LINX query of Donita Phillips that revealed on May 9, 2015, Phillips was the victim of theft from a motor vehicle and malicious destruction of property in Washington DC. Metropolitan Police Department Report number (15067005). During this incident, Phillips&amp;rsquo; purse and wallet, along with her social security card and birth certificate were stolen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;According to Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation website, the address of 103 Creston Avenue, Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061, was purchased by Phillips on 4/10/2019 from Stephen Allen Peck DOB 04/29/1954. Peck currently retains the address of 103 Crest Avenue, Glen Burnie, Maryland through the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A subpoena will be authored to obtain the owners account information for Dulce Products LLC and all IP logs used by the administrator and owner of the site. Additionally, the payment method for the website, creation date and email addresses associated with the website will be outlined in the subpoena.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I contacted Joanne Schick on 6/5/2023 to advise her of the case status. I requested her call logs for the months of January-March 2023, to inquire if there are any telephone calls from Jack Siglar.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On June 11, 2023, I conducted another business entity search of Dulce Products LLC. Dulce Products is now listed as &amp;ldquo;Not in Good Standing.&amp;rdquo; I retrieved the Articles of Organization from the website. &amp;nbsp;The Articles of Organization still lists Donita Phillips as the resident agent of the company. A copy of the AOO is attached to this report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I then checked the website of Dulce Products again and observed the website to have a return address for their products. This was not on the website previously. The return address for the products is 5242 Argosy Avenue , Huntington Beach, California. A Google search of the address lists the address as a company called &amp;ldquo;Prizes&amp;rdquo; which is a toy store. The google map search further revealed this to be a warehouse that is permanently closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On June 11, 2023, I contacted the Huntington Beach Police Department to inquire about Prizes toy store. I was advised by a Huntington Beach Police Officer the company has no call history besides a few alarms. I asked the police officer if they have a policy to obtain a name of whom they contact when they respond. The police officer advised they do not and typically only speaks with the monitoring company. I was advised by the police officer Prizes is now called Fulfilment X.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I then conducted a check of Fulfilment X, which is officially named XPro Fulfilment Corporation. The website appeared fake as there was no contact information, vague descriptions of the service they provide, and none of the hyperlinks were active. I conducted a California business entity search of XPro Fulfilment, and it is listed in &amp;ldquo;Good Standing.&amp;rdquo; The agent listed for XPro Fulfilment Corporation is Corporation Builders, INC. The filing date is July 6, 2022.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A Google search of the address for the Corporation Builders returned as 413 S Riverside Drive, unit D, Modesto California. I searched the address which returned to C.W.Brower INC. Wholesale Grocers. It is unknown at this time if this business has any involvement at this time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I located a telephone number for Corporation Builders, 949-612-5418. A LINX query on the telephone number returned to a Gary Douglas Grant, DOB 08/21/1957, of California. It is unknown if Grant has any involvement at this time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After viewing Dulce Products, XPro Fulfilment Corporation, and Corporation Builders, I noticed all three websites had similarities. All three websites appear to have the same design themes including color schemes, and similar wording on the sites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then researched Donita Phillips through www.bizapedia.com. Three companies returned to Phillips as the resident agent:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;DP 103 LLC. &amp;nbsp;The purpose for which the Limited Liability Company is for &amp;ldquo;Real Estate Services: Buy,Sale And Invest in Real Estate Property. The address associated is 103 Crest Avenue, Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061. The Articles of Organization was filed on August 17, 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; I could not locate any additional information for this business through numerous website searches. There is a signature associated on the AOO for Phillips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Dotted Pines LLC. &amp;nbsp;The Articles of Organization does not list a purpose for which the Limited Liability Company is for. The address associated is 103 Crest Avenue, Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061. The Articles of Organization was filed on June 15, 2022. I could not locate any additional information for this business through numerous website searches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Dulce Products LLC. The Articles of Organization does not list a purpose for which the Limited Liability Company is for. The address associated is 103 Crest Avenue, Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061. The Articles of Organization was filed on August 1, 2022.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; After researching these three business, I noticed all three companies had the initials &amp;ldquo;D.P.&amp;rdquo; Additionally, only the AOO for Dulce Products LLC states &amp;ldquo;Mrs.&amp;rdquo; as part of the filing parties name and return address. All three businesses were created within the same time period, as was XPro Fulfillment Corporation/ Corporation Business INC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;An &amp;ldquo;unmasked&amp;rdquo; people search of Donita Phillips revealed an email address associated to her as &amp;ldquo;DFP4biz@gmail.com&amp;rdquo;. A query of this email address through LINX revealed no related incidents. Phillips Facebook page was discovered where it lists she is a real estate agent with Samson Properties, located in Columbia Maryland. Samson Properties employs over 5500 agents and are licensed in Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Upon an initial research into the business, there appears to be a large amount of Middle Eastern agents. This is relevant as when I briefly spoke to the suspect scamming Schick on the telephone, I noticed suspect to have a Middle Eastern accent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I located Phillips Linked In account and reviewed her public profile. Phillips profile lists the following background information:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Production Control Specialist with Northrop Grumman- 2016- Present&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Licensed real estate agent- 2019- Present&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Independent Energy Consultant&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;System Administrator &amp;ndash;The Mil Company&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Help Desk Analysis- STG INC&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Technical Support Specialist- Time Warner Cable&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Verizon Central Office Tech&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;University of Maryland- Electrical &amp;amp; Electronics Engineering&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Strayer University: Associates of Applied Science in Computer Information Systems and Security Information Assurance&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Certified Security- CompTia &amp;ndash; The Computing Technology Industry Association, which is one of the Information Technologies top trade associations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;APICS- Operations Management certification that allows you to advance your supply chain career.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Some of these certifications and background experiences is consistent with facilitating the above findings. I request this case remain open pending a subpoena granted for NameCheap.com, and further investigation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>DATE: 9/6/2023&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; OFFENSE: Fraud&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; SUSPECT: Donita Felicia Phillips DOB 06/17/1973&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; VICTIM: Joanne Elizabeth Shick DOB 07/02/1954&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *Attachment: (1) One request for State&amp;#39;s Attorney Subpoena&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On March 7, 2023, at approximately 1805 hours, I, Corporal J. Palumbo # 5974 with the Maryland State Police responded to the MSP Prince Frederick Barrack for a reported fraud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I arrived at the Prince Frederick Barrack and made contact with the complainant/ victim, Joanne Elizabeth Shick, W/F, DOB 07/02/1954, who I positively identified by her Maryland Driver&amp;rsquo;s License. Shick advised last Monday (2/27/2023) her bank account was hacked. Shick further elaborated she received a text message from PNC Bank&amp;rsquo;s fraud department, advising there were possible fraudulent charges made utilizing her debit card. Shick advised there were two unauthorized purchases from her PNC Virtual Wallet with Performance Select bank account (X1166), for approximately $6.00 and $89.00. Shick was unsure of the actual amount at the time of this report. Shick recalled the purchases were some &amp;ldquo;gadgets&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Throughout this investigation, I pursued many leads, and developed the suspect of Donita Felicia Phillips DOB 06/17/1973. On August 20, 2023, I authored a subpoena for NameCheap.com seeking the owner&amp;#39;s/ administrator&amp;#39;s account information for the website of &amp;quot;www.dulceproductsgadgets.com&amp;quot;. Additionally, I requested the following that would be associated to&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;www.dulceproductsgadgets.com&amp;quot;, IP logs, payment methods for the website, email addresses, and any back up emails or contact information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This subpoena was submitted to Paula Shrawder with the Calvert County Circuit Court State&amp;#39;s Attorney Office. I was later contacted by the Calvert County Circuit Court State&amp;#39;s Attorney Office, and advised this subpoena was screened by one of the judges. It was determined that due to the monetary value of the crime not meeting the felony threshold, the subpoena would not be granted. It should be noted, that by granting this subpoena, the results may have uncovered evidence that would rise to a felony.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
