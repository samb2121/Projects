         <NarrativeText>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;This incident was recorded audibly and visually on BWC and MVR.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Defendant: Casey, Kimberly Golena&lt;br /&gt; Date of Birth: 07/06/1963&lt;br /&gt; Date of Arrest: 10/03/2023&lt;br /&gt; Times of Arrest: 0052 Hours&lt;br /&gt; DUI # 23-311: (Forestville Barrack)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;Trained and certified to operate the Preliminary Breath Test through the Maryland State Police.&lt;br /&gt; *Trained in&amp;nbsp;Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (A.R.I.D.E.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On 10/03/2023 at approximately 0015 hours, Cpl. Taylor#5479 and I were assigned to work zone enforcement and were parked stationary directly behind the crash trucks on Indian Head Highway in the area of Fort Road, Fort Washington, Prince George&amp;#39;s County, Maryland. We observed a red Chevrolet Blazer bearing Maryland registration (1FH4694) traveling at a high rate of speed directly behind Cpl. Taylor. The Chevrolet came to a hard stop and swerved to the left, causing the traffic behind it to stop at the same time. Corporal Taylor then activated his patrol vehicle emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop in the left turn lane. I then positioned my vehicle directly behind Corporal Taylor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I approached the driver&amp;#39;s side of the vehicle&amp;nbsp;and requested the driver to exit her vehicle.&amp;nbsp;She complied and exited her vehicle. I immediately detected an odor of alcoholic beverages emitting from inside the vehicle and on her breath. The driver was identified as&amp;nbsp;Casey, Kimberly Golena (DOB: 07/06/1963, B/F) by her Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license. I observed Casey&amp;#39;s eyes to be glassy and her speech was slurred. I questioned Casey about when was the last time she had consumed alcoholic beverages and she stated &amp;quot;about an hour ago&amp;quot;. I asked where she was coming from and she stated &amp;quot;Sunnybrook Tavern.&amp;quot; Casey advised that she had three Heinekens.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;I informed Casey that I wanted her to perform Standardized Field sobriety Tests, to which she agreed to the tests.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The evaluation was performed on the left turn lane S/B MD-210 in the area of Fort Road. The surface was dry, level, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 67 degrees. Lights consisted of my flashlight and surrounding lights. Casey appeared to be in good physical condition. (Reference below for further information regarding Casey&amp;#39;s injuries and medications).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked Casey the following questions:&lt;br /&gt; Injuries - No.&lt;br /&gt; Medication - High blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma.&lt;br /&gt; Contact lenses - No.&lt;br /&gt; Glasses - Yes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Casey&amp;#39;s eyes. She was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping her head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with her eyes until told to stop. Casey&amp;#39;s pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking, and no resting Nystagmus was observed. I asked Casey if she understood the instructions, and she stated, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 2) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 3) The Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Vertical Nystagmus - Not observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WALK AND TURN (7/8 clues observed)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Prior to Casey performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Casey was instructed to imagine a straight line and put her left foot on the imaginary line, place her right foot directly in front of her left foot, and touch heel to toe. After she assumed the instructional position, she was advised to keep her hands flat at her side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Casey was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. Casey was to keep her hands flat at her side, keep her eyes focused on her feet, and count every step aloud. On the ninth step, she was instructed to keep her lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with her rear foot to turn completely around. Casey was again explained, and I demonstrated that the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. Casey was instructed that once she began the test that she was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep her hands down by her side, look down at her feet, and count each step out loud. I asked Casey if she understood the test, and she stated, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;(Footwear: Black sneakers).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Instructional Stage:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1) Unable to maintain balance - She could not maintain her balance while I was explaining the instructions.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2) Starts too soon - Not observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walking Stage (1st nine):&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1) Stops while walking - Observed. She stopped before turning to complete the second series of the test.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2) Misses heel-to-toe - Observed. She missed step two.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3) Step off the line - Observed. She stepped off-line after missing step two.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4) Uses arms to balance - Observed. She raised her arms the entire time.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 5) Incorrect amount of steps - Not observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walking Stage (2nd nine):&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1) Stops while walking - Observed. She stopped walking after turning around.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2) Misses heel-to-toe - Observed. She missed step three.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3) Step off the line - Observed. She stepped off-line after missing step three&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4) Uses arms to balance - Observed - She raised her arms the entire time.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5) Incorrect amount of steps - Observed - She took 12 steps.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Turn:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Completed improperly.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Casey was instructed to stand with her heels together and hands down at her sides while the instructions were given during the test. When instructed to start, she was to raise the foot of her choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While her leg was raised, she was to keep her leg straight, watch her raised foot, count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two, one thousand-three), and continue the test until told to stop. Casey was asked if she understood the test and Casey stated that she understood.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 1) Putting Foot down - Observed.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 2) Swaying - Observed.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 3) Hopping - Not observed&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; 4) Raising Arms -Observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After completing the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, I requested Casey to submit the Preliminary Breath Test (PBT), and she refused.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ARREST/ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Based on the following, I had reasons to believe Casey was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:&lt;br /&gt; *Slurred speech&lt;br /&gt; *Admission to consuming alcoholic beverages&lt;br /&gt; *Glassy eyes&lt;br /&gt; *An odor of alcoholic beverages&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Casey was arrested for DUI/DWI at 0052 hours. Casey was then transported to the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack. While en route to the barrack, I played the English audio DR-15 Advice of Rights form via the MVA&amp;rsquo;s official law enforcement website to her in its entirety. At the conclusion of the DR-15, Casey agreed to submit to the intoximeter test (10/03/2023 at 0118 hours), and later signed the form indicating the same.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I conducted the observation period on Casey in its entirety, starting with her time of arrest. I escorted Casey into the arrest processing room and remained in her custody until the time of releasing her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;INTOXIMETER RESULT:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The breath test was administered by Sergeant Estrin#6052, and two (2) samples of Casey breath were obtained. The breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of 0.19 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CHARGES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Casey was charged with the following citations:&lt;br /&gt; 1. DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL PER SE (18Z0YJK)&lt;br /&gt; 2. DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL (1900YJK)&lt;br /&gt; 3. DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE IMPAIRED BY ALCOHOL (1910YJK)&lt;br /&gt; 4. NEGLIGENT DRIVING (1920YJK)&lt;br /&gt; 5. UNSAFE LANE CHANGE (1930YJK)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Casey&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;was given all copies of pertinent paperwork and released to her friend.&amp;nbsp; She was polite, respectful, and cooperative towards the end of the process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed by arrest.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Prince George&amp;#39;s County, MD.&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;This incident was recorded audibly and visually on Body Worn Camera (BWC).&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Defendant: CASEY, Kimberly Golena&lt;br /&gt; Date of Birth: 07/06/1963&lt;br /&gt; Date of Arrest: 10/03/2023&lt;br /&gt; Times of Arrest: 0052 Hours&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; DUI # 23-311: (Forestville Barrack)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On October 3, 2023, at approximately 0015 hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Trooper Thienom #7518 and I (Corporal Taylor #5479) were working a state highway assignment southbound Route 210 (Indian Head Highway) at Swann Creek Rd, Fort Washington, Prince George&amp;#39;s County, Maryland. I observed a red Chevrolet Blazer bearing Maryland registration (1FH4694) traveling at a high rate of speed directly behind my marked patrol vehicle in lane two. The Chevrolet came to an abrupt stop less than one car length behind me and made and unsafe lane change into lane one causing the traffic behind it to stop at the same time. My patrol vehicle&amp;#39;s emergency equipment was already activated, so I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle and&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&amp;nbsp;made contact with the driver who was later identified by her Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license as Kimberly Golena Casey B/F DOB: 07/06/1963. While speaking with Casey I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath, her speech was slurred, and I noticed her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. Trooper Thienom #7518 responded to the scene to conduct standardized field sobriety tests on Casey. Casey was subsequently arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) and transported to the Maryland State Police Forestville Barrack for processing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Prince George&amp;#39;s County, MD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>
