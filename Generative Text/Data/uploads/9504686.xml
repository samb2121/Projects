         <NarrativeText>THIS INCIDENT WAS RECORDED ON BWC WITH FUNCTIONING AUDIO AND VIDEO&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Suspect:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Jennifer Cupples (W/F 04/24/1972)&lt;br /&gt; 9611 Morning Walk Drive, Hagerstown Maryland 21740&lt;br /&gt; 301-393-7777&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On July 12, 2023, at approximately 1401 hours, I responded to the Liberty Gas Station located at 10524 Sharpsburg Pike, Hagerstown Maryland for the report of a disorderly subject.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Upon arrival, I contacted the suspect who I identified as Jennifer Cupples (W/F 04/24/1972) As I contacted Cupples she took a hat she was wearing off, and placed it on the ground. Cupples then took off a black jacket she was wearing, and also threw it to the side. I asked Cupples what was going on, and she advised there were several African American subjects that came into the store, and advised the female workers were under duress. Cupples then began making several incoherent statements. Cupples sat down on the ground, and advised &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to sit right here&amp;rdquo; Cupples then lifted her legs straight up in the air, closed her eyes, and laid her head back. I asked Cupples several times to stand up, and have a conversation with me. Cupples failed to comply, and sat with her eyes closed on the ground, not answering to any verbal commands or questions. As I continued trying to speak with Cupples, she was constantly switching the topic of what she was talking about. Each topic was not coherent, and did not make any logical sense. Cupples then attempted to crawl out of the front door of the gas station on her hands and knee&amp;rsquo;s. at this time, Cupples was detained placed in handcuffs for her, and our safety. Cupples continually refused to sit up, and have a logical conversation. Cupples began screaming that we were raping her, and she needed federal help. Cupples began asking for Obama, Clinton, and began loudly singing &amp;ldquo;God Bless America.&amp;rdquo; Due to Cupples incoherent statements, and erratic behavior EMS was requested to respond to the scene, so she could be transported to Meritus Medical Center for an emergency petition for evaluation. EMS responded to the scene, at which time, Cupples continued to make nonsensical statements, and attempted to kick myself, and other Personnel on scene. Cupples grabbed my leg and boot, and refused to let go. Cupples was placed on a stretcher and had to be restrained with multiple straps, and have each arm handcuffed individually to the railings of the stretcher. With the assistance of EMS Personnel we were able to place Cupples into the back of the ambulance, at which time she continued to attempt to grab, and spit on myself, and other personnel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cupples was transported to Meritus Medical Center for an emergency petition for evaluation. This is the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; reported incident the MSP Hagerstown Barrack has handled involving Cupples (Reference 19-MSP-046212). Cupples was left in the care and custody of hospital staff. Cupples ex-husband, Jon Fletcher (240-401-2334) was contacted and advised of the situation. Fletcher advised Cupples is currently being treated by the VA for bipolar disorder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I respectfully request this case be closed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
