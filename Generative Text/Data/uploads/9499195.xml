Bryan advised he last saw Dawn at approximately 2130 hours on August 28, 2023. Bryan advised he and his wife, Deanna Cunningham (W/F 04/14/1963) were concerned that the family dog needed to go outside. Bryan advised Dawn and the family dog were inseparable, and it was not uncommon for Dawn to sleep late. Bryan advised he and his wife entered the bedroom, and did not see Dawn on the bed. Dawn was located by Deanna on the side of the bed, with a dog leash around her neck, to hanging from a dresser. Bryan advised he cut the dog leash, but Dawn was beyond help.

Bryan provided the statement captured above. I located the deceased, identified as, Dawn Nicole Cunningham (W/F 06/14/1985). Dawn was sitting on the ground of her bedroom leaned against a dresser. I observed Dawn had been cut down from a dog leash, that was still currently around her neck. I observed lividity in Dawn&amp;#39;s face, stomach, and feet. Dawn&amp;#39;s body was cold to the touch, rigor had set in. The approximate ambient temperature of the bedroom was 70 degrees fareinheit. I observed no signs of trauma. EMS responded to the scene, and did not perform CPR. Dawn was pronounced deceased by EMT Prescilla Morgan (registry number 0003240) at approximately 1027 hours. Prescriptions for Memantine, Buspirone, Sertraline, Propranolol, and Sumatriptan were located in a drawer in Dawn&amp;#39;s room. Medical Examiner Roger Testerman responded to the scene, and advised the ME office doctor, doctor Dean would sign off on the death certificate. There were no signs of foul play in this case. Dawn&amp;#39;s body was transported from the scene by Thompsons funeral home.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I respectfully request this case be closed.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 8/28/2023, the MSP Hagerstown Barrack contacted CED West Investigators to assist with a reported hanging at 13819 Big Pool Rd., Clear Spring, MD 21722. S/T Darren Burleson and D/Sgt P. Martin responded to assist. On scene, we were led to a front bedroom of the residence where a white female was observed in a seated position in front of a cabinet. The female had one end of a dog leash around her neck and the other end was attached to a door knob of the furniture she was seated in front of. The leash had been cut by family members prior to police arrival. The female was identified as Dawn Nicole Cunningham, W/F 6/14/1985. The residence belonged to Cunningham&amp;#39;s parents, who had allowed her to move in with them to help Cunningham with her personal life. Cunningham&amp;#39;s parents reported she had fighting depression and not going to work for a few weeks, but did not think that the situation had gotten to the point of suicide. They indicated, however, that when they had noticed that Cunningham had not taken her dog outside this morning, her father had gone to check on her and found her unresponsive. Nothing suspicious was noted upon examining the scene.&amp;nbsp; The victim had multiple medications, including for depression.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The scene was documented on body camera by S/T Burleson and D/Sgt Martin took photos which are attached to this report.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Forensic Investigator Testerman responded to the scene and conducted his investigation, determining that no autopsy would be necessary.&amp;nbsp; Thompson Funeral Home was contacted and responded to take care of the victim&amp;#39;s body per family request.&amp;nbsp; TFC D. Harper of MSP Hagerstown will remain the assigned investigator.</NarrativeText>
