         <NarrativeText>The DUI Number for the following incident is 23-093&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This incident was recorded on mobile video. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Violation:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 09/16/2023 at approximately 1640 hours, I was on routine patrol operating MSP unmarked vehicle Tac-18. &amp;nbsp;At that time, I was dispatched to respond to a motor vehicle collision that occurred in the area of RT 63 and I-70. &amp;nbsp;Upon my arrival, I identified the at fault vehicle to be a 2015 GMC Terrain bearing IN registration S115424. &amp;nbsp;The other vehicle involved was identified as a 2017 Kia Forte bearing MD registration 83827HT. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Through my investigation it was revealed that the Kia was traveling northbound on rt 63. &amp;nbsp;The defendant&amp;rsquo;s vehicle was attempting to make a left turn onto southbound rt 63 from the off ramp of eastbound I-70. &amp;nbsp;The defendant&amp;rsquo;s vehicle failed to stop at the stop sign at that location and failed to yield the right of way to the other vehicle. &amp;nbsp;This caused the defendant&amp;rsquo;s vehicle to enter the roadway directly in front of the Kia and the front of the defendant&amp;rsquo;s vehicle to strike the passenger side of the Kia. &amp;nbsp;The driver of the at fault vehicle (GMC) was identified as the defendant in this case as Tamara Denise Lewis (B/F, D.O.B. 8/2/1980).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I initially observed what smelled and appeared to be a spilled alcoholic beverage that the defendant had dropped as she was being helped from her vehicle onto the ambulance. Upon making contact with the defendant (who was located in the ambulance), I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her breath, her eyes appeared bloodshot and glassy and her speech was slurred. &amp;nbsp;There was also an open alcoholic beverage located inside of the cup holder of the vehicle (New Amsterdam &amp;ldquo;Wild Card&amp;rdquo; Classic Hard Punch).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The defendant was transported via ambulance (Medic 28 run # 2325178) to Meritus Medical Center for treatment. &amp;nbsp;Upon my arrival, I made contact with EMS who advised that the defendant was very uncooperative during transport and that she had refused treatment upon arrival and was attempting to leave the hospital. &amp;nbsp;I made contact with the charge nurse who confirmed that the defendant had refused treatment and left the hospital on foot. &amp;nbsp;The defendant was located on the Robinwood property which is connected to Mertius Medical Center (total time from my arrival at Meritus to locating defendant was 16 minutes). &amp;nbsp;Upon making contact with the defendant, she stated that she had not consumed an alcohol since leaving the hospital.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Based on my observations the defendant was asked to perform SFST&amp;rsquo;s. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; STANDARD FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I am trained and certified to perform Standardized Field Sobriety tests (SFTS&amp;rsquo;s) by the Maryland State Police and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. &amp;nbsp;I have also attended and completed Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training. &amp;nbsp; The defendant advised that she was currently taking hydrocodone for pain management (last taken at 0700 hours) and that she had consumed a &amp;ldquo;cooler&amp;rdquo; earlier in the morning before she drove to Maryland. She stated that she did not have any injuries or medical conditions that would prevent her from performing field sobriety tests. &amp;nbsp;Field Sobriety was performed on the sidewalk. &amp;nbsp;The surface was free from debris and was a level concrete surface.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TEST #1 Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The defendant stated that she did not have any medical or physical problems that would prevent her from taking the test. The test was explained and the defendant stated that she understood the test instructions. She stated that she could see the stimulus and was able to track it with her eyes. She displayed equal pupil size and equal tracking in both eyes. &amp;nbsp;She displayed lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; TOTAL CLUES: 6 out of 6&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TEST #2: Walk and Turn&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The defendant was placed in the instructional stage and the test was demonstrated and explained. &amp;nbsp;The defendant was unable to maintain her balance throughout the instructional portion of the test. On the first set of 9 steps the defendant stepped off line and missed heel to toe on step 8. The defendant did not perform the turn as demonstrated and stopped walking after the turn and had to be instructed to continue the test. &amp;nbsp;On the second set of nine steps the defendant stepped off line and missed heel to toe on step 1. The defendant raised her arms for balance more than 6 inches from her body throughout the test.&lt;br /&gt; TOTAL CLUES: &amp;nbsp;6 out of 8.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TEST #3 One-leg stand&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The defendant was offered to take the one leg stand test and the test was demonstrated and explained. &amp;nbsp;The defendant raised her left foot and attempted to take the test. &amp;nbsp;The defendant swayed and put her foot down on count 2. &amp;nbsp;She also raised her arms for balance more than 6 inches during the first 10 seconds of the test. &amp;nbsp;The defendant did not count correctly by repeating some numbers and counting other numbers out of order.&lt;br /&gt; TOTAL CLUES: 3 out of 4&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The defendant was also offered a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) via PBT Serial Number 70017334 in order to gauge the defendant&amp;#39;s level of intoxication. The defendant agreed to take the test with a result of .12.&lt;br /&gt; ACTION TAKEN:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The defendant was placed under arrest at 1807 hours on 09/16/2023. &amp;nbsp;The defendant was advised of her rights via MVA DR15 at 1841 hours and refused to submit to the breath test. &amp;nbsp;The defendant was provided with the appropriate paperwork and released to Meritus Medical Center due to her requesting medical assistance. An MVA check of the defendant&amp;rsquo;s driver&amp;rsquo;s license revealed that her license was currently suspended. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Washington County, Maryland. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Case Status: Based on the above stated facts, I respectfully request this case be closed by arrest.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
