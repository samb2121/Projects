         <NarrativeText>On Tuesday, December 12th, 2023, I, S/TPR. J. Woo #5911, was dispatched to respond to the area of RT 611 (Stephen Decatur HWY) near Clark Rd in reference to abandoned property/illegal dumping.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this area, there was a large travel trailer camper, which appeared to have been abandoned on the side of the roadway. The trailer was off the shoulder on a right of way which was paved by Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I had observed this trailer to be in this area for approximately 3 weeks. I noticed that the trailer had arrived around hunting the opening day of firearms hunting season. The trailer has two flat tires on the right side. There is a broken window on the right side, and the door to the camper appears to have at one point been pride open and was bent. The door did not close tightly and was opened upon my arrival.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I knocked and looked through the windows and did not observe anyone in the camper. I did noticed a hospital information bracelet hanging from the wall inside the camper. After checking the area, I entered the camper and observed the hospital bracelet and a GEICO insurance form which both had the name Gerald Exter on them. The hospital bracelet had &amp;quot;Exter, Gerald A. DOB: 02/23/1962&amp;quot; A check of this name showed that Exter lived at 12129 Dutch Harbor Rd, Berlin, which was, according to my GPS, 700 feet from the location of where the camper was parked, just down Clark Rd.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then responded to the address and made contact with a female by the name of Kerri Lynn Curran 09/13/1963. I asked Curran what was going on with the camper. Curran quickly became nervous, visibly shaking and displaying facial twitching. Curran stated she did not know anything about the camper, but she would love for it to be gone. After further questioning, Curran admitted that her brother Gerald Exter Jr 02/23/1962, used to live in the camper. She stated she has no idea how the camper got there. She stated that it used to be parked at the end of the Dutch Harbor Ln. She stated that she came home from work one day, and the camper had been moved to its current location, by the roadway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Curran stated that her brother intended to give it away for free, that the camper had a &amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; sign on it, but it kept blowing off. In all the times that I had driven past the camper, I had never seen a sign on or near the camper indicating it was free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Curran stated she would attempt to contact her brother. Curran was advised that Exter needs to remove the camper as soon as possible or he would be charged for the removal. Curran later advised that Exter must have blocked her number because her phone call was not going through. I then obtained Exter&amp;#39;s phone number, which was 443-235-4524. I attempted to call and got an error message. The Duty Officer also attempted to call and got an error message.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After consultation with command staff, it was determined that we would give Exter 48 hours from this morning, 0900 hours on 12/12/2023, to remove the camper, otherwise he would be charged criminally. I then responded back to the residence to make contact with Curran. Curran advised that she was able to text Exter and advised him of the situation. Curran was not apologetic and asurred us that Exter would remove the camper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then clearly explained to her that he had 48 hours to remove the camper. If the camper was not removed, we would be forced to remove it and Exter would be charged for illegal dumping/littering and any other applicable charges. I also gave Curran the MSP Berlin Barrack Phone number. I asked her to please text Exter with all of the above stated information and have him contact the MSP Berlin Duty Officer in person so that we can speak to him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Curran advised that she would do this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As of 1445 hours, Exter has not contacted the MSP Berlin Barrack. I will attempt to contact him in person again tomorrow morning if the camper has not been removed by then.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 12/13/2023 at approximately 0630 I made contact with Exter in person. Exter explained that he used to live in the trailer, but that he does not &amp;quot;legally&amp;quot; own it. I asked how the trailer got moved to where it was now. Exter advised that he moved it there. He explained that he intended to put it out for free to see if a hunter would want it for a hunting cabin or something along those lines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then explained to Exter that he had 48 hours from yesterday mooring, and that it was not 24 hours from this morning to get the trailer removed. Exter explained that he would try to get it moved, but that he had to try to borrow a truck from work. He explained that his truck was not capable of moving it. I asked how he got the trailer there. Exter explained that he borrows a truck from work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I advised him to maybe borrow his sister&amp;#39;s truck or someone else if need be, but that if the trailer was not removed by the next morning, he would be charged criminally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Exter stated that he understood, and that he would do his best to have it removed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 12/14/2023, at approximately 1230 hours, I drove through the area and observed that the trailer had been removed. No further action required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Worcester County, MD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
