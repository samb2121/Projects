         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Raney completed a Maryland State Police Victim/Witness Statement Form, signed and attached to this report.&lt;br /&gt; Raney provided Documents mailed from FCO Fair Collections &amp;amp; Outsourcing Inc. and alleged Lease agreement signature page. Total (9) pages, all documents are attached to this report.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; A Maryland State Police Crime Victim pamphlet was completed and handed to Raney.&lt;br /&gt; A Maryland State Police Uniform Identity Fraud /Theft Reporting Form (MSP 89A) was completed, and a copy is attached to this report.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On May 09, 2023, at approximately 1329 hours, I was on uniformed patrol in my unmarked Maryland State Police vehicle U-5. I responded to the Maryland State Police Prince Fredrick Barrack, located at 210 Main Street, Prince Fredrick, Calvert County, Maryland, for a fraud report. The complainant advised that he was a victim of fraud.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The victim who was later identified through his Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license as Jon Dwayne Raney 07/31/1973, advised that, he has received two (2) telephone calls and three (3) letters from FCO Fair Collection &amp;amp; Outsourcing, Inc. in regard to a lease agreement between him and Highline Union Market Bozzuto Management, 320 Florida Ave NE, Washington DC 20002. Raney advised that, while on the telephone call (240-374-5400), he informed the representative that he has never lived or leased an apartment in Washington DC. Raney advised that, the company later sent him a package through US mail with a lease agreement and his alleged signature that is electronic. Raney advised that he does not recall the names of the representatives he spoke with from FCO Fair Collections &amp;amp; Outsourcing, Inc. Raney advised that, he was mailed some documents requesting his personal information, but he never mailed any information back to the collection company. Raney also advised that, the collection company has added a report on his Equifax credit report. Raney advised that he is in the process of disputing the report, and he has put a freeze on his credit report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I advised Raney to put a freeze on his credit report with all three credit bureaus. I advised Raney to dispute the report that has been put on his Equifax credit report.&amp;nbsp; I also advised Raney to check with the VA and all other entities that he is getting benefits from to make sure nothing has changed in his records. I provided Raney with a Maryland State Police Crime Victim pamphlet. I provided Raney a Maryland State Police Uniform Identity Fraud / Theft Reporting Form (MSP 89A). I also provided Raney with a case number 23- MSP- 016529 and advised him of the case status.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have requested subpoenas to be sent out to Highline Union Market Bozzuto Management, 320 Florida Ave NE, Washington DC 20002. And to FCO&amp;nbsp;Fair Collections &amp;amp; Outsourcing, Inc. 12304 Baltimore Ave Suite #E, Beltsville, MD 20705.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case remain open pending receipt of the subpoenas.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>This incident was audibly and visually recorded on my BWC utilizing the Axon Digital Recording System.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Scene Processing:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The victim responded to the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack and completed the Maryland State Police Uniformed Identity Fraud/Theft Reporting Form. That form is attached to this supplemental report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Physical Evidence:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (11) Eleven pages containing the falsified contract and a notice from a debt collection company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (1) One&amp;nbsp;Maryland State Police Uniformed Identity Fraud/Theft Reporting Form.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On September 29, 2023, Raney responded to the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick Barrack to report additional information for this case. Raney advised that on September 25, 2023, he received a letter from Columbia Debt Recovery LLC DBA Genesis stating that he had an unpaid balance of $18,862.94. Raney advised the company that the unpaid balance was from fraudulent activity. They provided him a list of items that he needed to provide to them to prove that it was fraud. One of the items Raney needed was a copy of the police report. I advised Raney that a supplement to his original report would be completed and that the case number would remain the same. Raney advised that an apartment was leased using his information. The apartment was located at 14203 MacFarlane Green Court, Apartment 3117, Upper Marlboro, Prince George&amp;#39;s County, Maryland. The apartment contract was dated from March 26, 2021 to March 25, 2022. Raney advised that he has never lived at that apartment and that the contract had an electronic signature in cursive, &amp;quot;Jon Raney&amp;quot;. The rent due each month was listed as &amp;quot;$1,975.00&amp;quot;. A copy of that contract is attached to this supplemental report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; D/Sgt. Hunt contacted the rental office for the apartment complex and spoke with an employee. The employee stated that she was not employed during those dates on the lease and that she was unable to answer questions due to that reason.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Raney advised that he wished to be entered into NCIC (NIC# J510092294) as a victim of identity theft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case remain open pending contact with property management for the apartment complex.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Prince George&amp;#39;s and Calvert County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
