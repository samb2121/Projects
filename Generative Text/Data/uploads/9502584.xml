         <NarrativeText>&lt;p&gt;Patrol Vehicle Information- Q11 (Marked) is equipped with a mobile recording device. Event captured on Body Camera.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Defendant: Ricky Randal Pearson Jr&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Date Of Arrest: 03/10/2023&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Time Of Arrest: 2231 hours&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Officer&amp;rsquo;s Training/Experience&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests through the Eastern Shore Criminal Justice Academy and the Maryland State Police Academy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Trained and certified to operate Radar through the Maryland State Police.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On March 10, 2023, at approximately 2144 hours, I Trooper Nikodemski #7510 responded to the area of Crain Highway at Columbia Way for a single vehicle collision. Upon arrival, I observed a Grey Hyundai Accent displaying Maryland registration 3DT1341 with heavy front end damage on the grassy shoulder of the roadway. I observed tire impressions in the mud and grass leading from the roadway directly into a light pole and then down a grassy embankment to where the vehicle was not located.&amp;nbsp; The light pole was completely detached from its base and now laying on the ground from the impact with the vehicle. I also observed Tfc.Strine and Trooper Houck to also be on scene standing with a subject later identified by his Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license as Ricky Randal Pearson Jr.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;I made contact with the driver and sole occupant (Pearson) who was retrieving documents from the passenger side of the vehicle. I observed a moderate odor of an acholic beverage to be emanating from his breath and person. Pearson initially stated that he was not driving the vehicle and tried to explain that the vehicle was on a different road and had not hit the pole even though his tire impressions clearly indicated otherwise. I explained to Pearson that I could clearly see that the vehicle had struck the pole and then traveled to down the hill to its now resting place, and he was driving at the time. Pearson denied driving at the time of the collision but admitted to driving just before the collision. I asked Pearson if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages prior to driving. Pearson stated that he had drank a &amp;quot;couple of beers&amp;quot; prior to driving. I requested Pearson preform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST&amp;#39;s).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Pearson was placed in front of his vehicle to preform SFST&amp;#39;s. All patrol vehicles in the near vicinity had their front facing emergency lights deactivated for all tests.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A routine check of Pearson&amp;#39;s license and wanted status revealed that he possessed a valid driver&amp;#39;s license and was not wanted. Pearson&amp;#39;s vehicle registration was however suspended.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The evaluation was performed on the shoulder of the roadway, at the front of Pearson&amp;#39;s vehicle. The shoulder where the following tests were conducted was level, free and clear of any debris. It was clear weather, although it had rained heavily earlier in the evening.&amp;nbsp; Pearson was asked pre-evaluation screening questions and stated he did have any conditions that would prevent him from preforming my tests.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN) (6/6 clues observed)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the test&amp;#39;s stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Pearson&amp;#39;s eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. His pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking with no resting nystagmus. Pearson was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated yes. At this time I could still observe a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage still emanating from his breath and person.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Pearson if he was able to see the tip of my pen to which Pearson stated yes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1.) Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3.) Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4.)&amp;nbsp; Vertical Nystagmus - Present in both eyes&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;WALK AND TURN (3/8 clues observed)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Prior to Pearson performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Pearson was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. He was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in that position until told to begin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pearson was wearing a boot style shoe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1.) Balance- Pearson remained as demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2.) Starts too soon- Pearson remained as demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3.) Stops walking-Completed as demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4.) Misses to toe- Pearson missed heal to toe on his third step&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5.) Steps off-line- Pearson stepped of line on his third step&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;6.) Raises arms- Pearson lifted his arm on his third step&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;7.) Actual # steps-Completed as demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;8.) Improper turn -Completed as demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ONE LEG STAND (3/4 clues observed)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Prior to Pearson performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be performed. He was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one thousand-one, one thousand-two) and to continue the test until told to stop. Pearson was asked if he understood the test and the instructions to which he stated yes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pearson chose to balance on his right foot, raising his left.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1.) Sways-Completed as demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2.) Raise arms - Completed as demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3.) Hopps- Completed as demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4.) Puts foot down - Completed as demonstrated&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;ARREST&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Based on the following, I had reason to believe Pearson was driving a motor vehicle under the influence:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Involved in a motor vehicle collision,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Admission to drinking prior to driving.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-Multiple Clues during Field Sobriety Testing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-Pearson had a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pearson was offered a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) and refused.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Due to the number of observations, I concluded Pearson was driving under the influence of alcohol and unable to operate a vehicle safely. At approximately 2231 hours, I placed Pearson under arrest for driving while impaired. Pearson&amp;nbsp;was placed in my patrol vehicle and read aloud by audio clip the DR-15 Advice of Rights at approximately 2241 hours from the Motor Vehicle&amp;nbsp;Administration website. Pearson upon being read the Advice of Rights refused to take the test at approximately 2250 hours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I transported Pearson to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack, in College&amp;nbsp;Park, Maryland where he was released to a sober driver.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Pearson&amp;#39;s vehicle was towed from the scene by Alley Cat Towing.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;INTOXIMETER RESULT: REFUSED&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A DR-15A was completed, and a temporary license was issued. Pearson was issued copies of MVA paperwork to include the DR-15, DR-15A.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pearson was issued traffic citations related to DUI and failure to control speed to avoid a collision and suspended registration.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A ACRS report was completed for this vehicle collision by Trooper Houck and attached with this report.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All events occurred in Prince George&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Case Status-CLOSED by adult arrest.&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>
