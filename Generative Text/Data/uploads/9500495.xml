         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 9/14/2023 at approximately 1009 hours, Cpl. Posey was directed to respond to 6298 Maxwell Dr. Apt 4, Camp Springs, MD. 20746, to assist the Department Of Labor with a firearm recovered during a residential search and seizure warrant. Upon arrival, Cpl. Posey and Tfc. Hussey of the criminal enforcement division Southern Region, made contact with investigators for further information on how we could assist. Investigators advised they were conducting a search warrant, due to benefits the suspect was receiving by fraudulent means. During the course of executing the warrant, investigators observed a firearm believed to be a ghostgun, that was not covered in the scope of evidence to be seized. Cpl. Posey and Tfc. Hussey both examined the firearm and did not observe a serial number on the parts of the weapon a serial number would typically be located. Tfc. Hussey contacted the College Park barrack to initiate a case number for this incident. Cpl. Posey made contact with the renter of the residence Danielle Wilson B/F who was read a consent form for the weapon to be seized. Ms. Wilson was clear that she was just signing as the renter to give permission to take the weapon but she was not responsible for the firearm or it being in her apartment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The weapon was seized according to Maryland State Police policy and procedure and transported to the Forestville Barrack for packaging. The firearm is held on property record number P-339257 and currently stored at the Forestville Barrack.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Any further investigative efforts, will be conducted by Maryland State Police Firearms Unit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CASE CLOSED.</NarrativeText>
