         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Sunday, May 28th, 2023 I, S/Tpr. J. Woo #5911, was dispatched to respond to the address of 10332 Friendship Rd for a 16YO female who was suicidal and screaming at her parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arrival, I contacted the Juvenile identified as Emilie Jo Entwistle 16YO Female. Emilie was crying uncontrollably and not making sense. As I attempted to find out what was going on. Emilie appeared to have anger towards her parents. Some of this seemed to be normal teen-parent relationship issues. There did also appear to be some other issues going on. I requested CRT responded to the scene.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I spoke with the mother, identified as Natalie Dawn Goodman 03/22/1970. Natalie stated that Emilie has Borderline Personality Disorder. She stated that Emilie has severe trauma issues and is seeing three different mental health counselors, a Family Counselor (Alexa Shoultes with Chesapeake Family) a Trauma therapy counselor (Samantha from Life Crisis) and a personal counselor (Kimberly Meilhammer with Chesapeake.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; During the investigation, Natalie stated that Emilie has done self-harm, specifically cutting, in the past. She is not sure if she is currently, but does not believe she is. Natalie stated that Emilie attempted suicide once in 5th grade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Natalie stated that what was concerning today was that Emilie was making statements that they (Emilie&amp;#39;s parents) Would find her dead one day. And that she was awake feeling suicidal all night.&amp;nbsp; Emilie also stated &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t feel sad when I&amp;#39;m not alive because you didn&amp;#39;t care when I was alive.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While speaking with Emilie, she stated that she was upset because she smokes marijuana in order to help her cope with her anxiety and mental health issues. She stated that she has been trying to cut back, and had not smoked in a week. Emilie stated she was going through withdraw and needed to smoke a little bit so she could sleep and calm down before going to work at 3 PM. She stated that her mother first told her she would take her, but later stated she would not take her. Emilie stated that this made her angry because, had she known her mother would not take her, Emilie would have just gone to sleep.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After speaking with Natalie, it later came out that Emilie was being deceitful and asked for her mother to take her to get her pay check so she could buy craft supplies. Natalie stated she would take Emilie to get craft supplies, and that Natalie would pay for them, and Emilie could pay her back after she gets her pay check when she goes to work at 3 PM. When it came out that Emilie wanted to get her pay check to buy marijuana, Natalie then did not want to take Emilie to do to this because it is illegal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Emilie was angry at her parents for being too controlling, but also not caring enough. While at the house, I observed Emilie to have outbursts at her parents for no apparent reason. Emilie was angry at her parents for trying to do things to help, and for not doing anything to help. Emilie could not articulate what she wanted other than to be able to smoke marijuana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Meaghan K. from CRT responded and spoke with all parties. Meaghan completed a safety plan for the family. The family was able to arrange for Emilie to stay at a friend&amp;#39;s house for the night to give both parties rest and separation from each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Emilie left with the friend&amp;#39;s mother.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Worcester County, MD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
