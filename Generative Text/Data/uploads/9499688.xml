         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Due to the nature of the incident, limited scene processing was conducted. I responded to Goodwill with the victim and observed the ATM kiosk. I cycled through the screen and observed a selection where it tells you to put your order in. That is what Mr. Bowles had been instructed to do. We put the same order number into the kiosks, but it said it wasn&amp;#39;t a valid order. Mr. Bowles advised when it worked, it had a window that said pay bond.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ACTION TAKEN:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 08/07/2023 at approximately 1026 hours, I M/TPR. C.R. TOEY #4986, was advised to respond to the barrack, which is located at 1125 National Highway, LaVale, Allegany County, Maryland, for a reported fraud. Upon my arrival, I made contact with the victim/complainant, William Martin BOWLES (W/M/09-14-1984).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Mr. Bowles advised he was at work this morning at Maryland Avenue Auto Services. He stated at approximately 9:05 am, his boss told him he had a phone call. He advised he answered the phone and a man was on the other end. He stated the man identified himself as a Maryland State Trooper and told him he needed to call him on his cell phone. William advised he then told the guy his cell number and at approximately 9:32 am, he received a call from a &amp;quot;NO CALLER ID&amp;quot; number. He stated the man then told him he had a warrant for failing to attend a seminar for his sex offender registry. He advised the man told him that he needed to tell his boss he needed to leave for 20 minutes but not to tell him why. He advised he was directed to stay on the phone and drive to the CVS in LaVale. He advised he drove to the CVS and then was directed to go to the ATM kiosk to pay his bond for the warrant. He stated he approached the kiosk and observed that it was out of order. He advised the caller then directed him to go to the Goodwill store in LaVale. He advised he approached the kiosk and was told his bond was $3000. He further advised he told the caller he didn&amp;#39;t have $3000 and the caller asked if he could pay $1000. He stated he told the caller he could and he was directed to enter 178130 as his order number. He advised a button popped up that said pay your bond. He advised he completed the transaction with his bank card for $1000.00 at 10:06 am and the caller ended the call. After completing the transaction, he started questioning everything. He advised he then came to the barrack to check to see if it was valid. He advised he was told he wasn&amp;#39;t wanted and that no transaction would&amp;#39;ve occurred like that with the police. He advised he also contacted his bank, Wepco Federal Credit Union, and they were attempting to block the transaction from going through.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I traveled to the Goodwill to observe the kiosk with Mr. Bowles. SEE SCENE PROCESSING. I contacted Sgt. Willetts, C3I, and he was not aware of other similar cases in our area. I conducted a check of the Maryland Sex Offender Registry and discovered as part of the registry, it does provide the offender&amp;#39;s work address. It appears Mr. Bowles may have specifically been targeted. I spoke with Mr. Bowles on 08/09/2023 via telephone and he advised the bank was not able to cancel the transaction but they were attempting to conduct an investigation to see where the money was sent. He advised he would update me in the future of their findings.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Due to the above facts, CASE OPEN, pending further investigation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
