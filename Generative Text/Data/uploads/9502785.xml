The caller, the on-duty employee of 7/11, advised that the subject appeared heavily intoxicated and was causing a disturbance within the store. The employee also advised that the subject had arrived in a vehicle with a numeric&amp;nbsp; license plate reading &amp;quot;5193MX.&amp;quot; I arrived on scene and observed a silver Honda Accord bearing South Carolina registration &amp;quot;5193MX&amp;quot; parked in a parking space. As I parked my patrol vehicle and approached the Honda, I observed the driver&amp;#39;s side door of the Honda open and an empty &amp;quot;99 Vodka&amp;quot; mini fall onto the ground before the door shut again. I approached the vehicle and observed that there was one occupant within the vehicle who was sitting in the driver&amp;#39;s seat. Within the vehicle, I observed two open and empty bottles of vodka in the passenger side rear floorboard of the vehicle and one bottle of the same vodka on the driver&amp;#39;s side floorboard of the Honda.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2):&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I made contact with the driver at the driver&amp;#39;s side door. As soon as the door opened, I immediately detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from within the vehicle. I observed that the driver&amp;#39;s eyes were dilated, as well as bloodshot, watery, and glassy. I also observed his face to be flushed. I asked the driver what was going on, and he began to stutter&amp;nbsp;unintelligibly. I introduced myself and explained to the driver that everything was being audibly and visually recorded, to which he stated, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have my key in the ignition&amp;quot; in a thick, slurred voice. I asked him if he had the keys on him, at which time he reached into his right front pocket and pulled out the keys to the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I again asked the driver what was going on, to which he answered, &amp;quot;Frankly sir this lady is freaking the fuck out.&amp;quot; I then asked the driver how much he had to drink, to which he stated, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve had a couple drinks sir. I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t drive.&amp;nbsp; I asked the driver for his driver&amp;#39;s license, and I was able to positively identify him as Henry Tyler Rihn (W/M 11/14/1995) by his South Carolina driver&amp;#39;s license. I asked Rihn how he got here, to which he answered, &amp;quot;I drove here and I bought some drinks.&amp;quot; I asked Rihn where he bought the drinks, to which he answered, &amp;quot;At, down the road, there&amp;#39;s a liquor store right down there.&amp;quot; I asked Rihn if that is where the two empty bottles of vodka in the backseat came from, to which he answered, &amp;quot;Yes sir.&amp;quot; I asked Rihn if he drank them both tonight, at which time his head sank and he nodded &amp;quot;Yes. At this time, I asked Rihn to step out of the car, to which he complied.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3):&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Rihn refused all Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and the Preliminary Breath Test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;ARREST:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Due to the following factors, Rihn was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol: &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In care and control of the vehicle (Sitting in driver&amp;#39;s seat, awake, keys in pocket)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Admission of consuming alcoholic beverage&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bloodshot, watery, glassy eyes&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the driver&amp;#39;s breath and person&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Open containers of alcohol within the vehicle&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Evidence of consuming large amounts of alcohol (2 empty 750mL bottles of vodka)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Rihn was placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 1911 hours. During my initial search of Rihn, I did not observe anything inside his mouth. Rihn was then placed in the front seat of my patrol vehicle. While on scene, I documented the open containers of alcohol within Rihn&amp;#39;s vehicle. The first open and empty container was mini &amp;quot;99 Peaches Liquer&amp;quot; vodka that I had placed into the driver&amp;#39;s side door pocket after it had originally fallen out of the vehicle. On the driver&amp;#39;s side floorboard, I observed one bottle of Smirnoff Vodka. On the rear passenger side floorboard, I observed two open and empty 750ML bottles of Smirnoff Vodka bottles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Rihn was then transported to the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack. During transport, I continued to detect the strong odor of ana acholic beverage as Rihn explained that he was in an alcohol recovery program and had relapsed.&amp;nbsp;At approximately 1958 hours, Rihn was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights and was offered a decision to submit to an alcohol concentration test. At the conclusion of the form, Rihn refused to submit to the test and signed the DR-15. At the conclusion of the DR-15, Rihn was placed into the Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack holding cell while I completed the paperwork, at which time Rihn began to intentionally urinate on the floor of the holding cell. Rihn was then transported to Carroll County Central Booking for his initial appearance with a District Court Commissioner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Carroll County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
