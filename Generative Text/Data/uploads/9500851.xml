         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217) of the Maryland State Police, am equipped with a body-worn camera, which was used to record this investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;On May 21, 2023, at approximately 1734 hours, I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217) of the Maryland State Police, was dispatched to Chesapeake Inn Restaurant and Marina located at 605 2nd Street, Chesapeake City, Maryland, in response to a domestic dispute. I arrived on scene at approximately 1755 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; During dispatch, I learned that the caller, later identified by her ex-boyfriend as Lindsay Marie Katherina (W/F; DOB: 10/12/1988), reported that her ex-boyfriend broke a window on her vehicle and was refusing to get out of her vehicle, all the while asking for her for a ride. Her vehicle was described as a green Toyota 4Runner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon arrival, I was able to locate one vehicle matching the description of a &amp;quot;green Toyota 4Runner.&amp;quot; The vehicle was a Toyota 4Runner bearing Pennsylvania registration LVX6803. However, I saw no one inside the vehicle when I peered through its windows. I also did not notice any visible damage to any of the vehicle&amp;#39;s windows. I did not see any other Toyota 4Runners in Chesapeake Inn Restaurant and Marina&amp;#39;s parking lot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I spoke with a valet at the establishment, who he described the female caller. I also gathered talking to staff that she was arguing with the male party in her vehicle for some time. However, I was told the male in the vehicle appeared to be calm during the dispute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I entered the establishment and asked employees if they saw a distressed female enter. This did not lead me to finding the caller. I eventually made contact with an employee who claimed he could recognize Katherina. He and I walked through the establishment, but Katherina was not located. She also did not make herself known to me as I walked through. This same employee that guided me through spotted a male sitting near one of the establishment&amp;#39;s bars. He told me he believed this male, identified as Eric Joseph Meekins (W/M; DOB: 10/24/1986), was possibly the male party involved in the dispute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I made contact with Meekins after my attempts to find Katherina failed. He told me he was not hurt, and what he told me led me to understand the dispute to be verbal. He told me the dispute regarded a past incident of infidelity in his and Katherina&amp;#39;s relationship. I noticed he seemed very calm. He told me he couldn&amp;#39;t get back to his vehicle (a separate vehicle from the Toyota 4Runner to my understanding) and his phone battery was depleted. He also did not know where Katherina went.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also requested the Maryland State Police North East Barrack attempt to call Katherina, as my attempts to locate her continually failed. The North East Barrack called her twice with no answer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I told Meekins to avoid further contact with Katherina before I broke contact with him. Considering his claim his phone was no longer working and that he was unable to get to his vehicle otherwise, I recommended that he make sure he&amp;#39;s sober before he attempts to leave the restaurant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Considering I could not make contact with Katherina, Meekins advised he was okay, and none of the staff I spoke to said they witnessed a physical altercation between Katherina and Meekins, I cleared the scene. Additionally, considering I did not see another Toyota 4Runner in the parking lot, it seems the allegation regarding the broken window is unfounded at this time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Case closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
