Was dispatched to Route 50 and Memory Gardens Lane for an accident with an ambulance and the striking vehicle in the ditch. I arrived at 2114 hours and observed a white Chrysler passenger car in the ditch bearing MD registration 4FD1640. A witness, identified as Emily Davis Grabowski (08/06/1993 2/F), was on scene next to the vehicle. I spoke to her and she stated that she did not see the accident, but she did arrive shortly after and witnessed a female exit the vehicle and no one else. She stated the female had blonde hair, jeans, white shirt, and a bag and that she was clearly intoxicated and falling over. She continued and said that she asked if she was okay and the female said she was fine and was going to walk. Grabowski stated that as she was calling 911, she witnessed the female go into the Valero gas station. I went to the gas station and spoke to the clerk who I identified as Dinesh Maharjan (09/02/1994 3/M) who stated that he did not see anyone matching that description enter the store in the past 30 minutes and stated the cameras were not functional. I checked the bathrooms and behind the counter and did not observe anyone in the store. I looked in the back, but the lights were off and I did not see anything. I went back to the scene of the accident and confirmed with Grabowski that she did see the female enter the Valero. She again confirmed that the female went inside and I responded back to the Valero to check the back room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I arrived back at the Valero and went to the back room. I entered and went father inside and I could see a female with blonde hair hunched over a small table in the back. I could detect the odor of alcohol from several feet away and attempted to speak to her. I spoke to her and she slowly lifted her head up and did not say anything to me. I could see her eyes were glassy and bloodshot and droopy. I asked her several questions and she looked at me confused for close to a minute. She was able to tell me her name was Stephanie, later confirmed as Stephanie Nicole Cornett (08/06/1993 2/F), and I asked her to stand up several times to come outside. As she went to stand up, she fell over into a step ladder and the shelving that was behind her. I had to assist her up and stand behind her as she walked outside. She almost fell over again after only a few steps and if I had not been there to assist her she would not have been able to successfully walk outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I walked her outside, I could clearly see that she had mud on her. She had a light white and purple hoodie on that was mostly white, sweatpants that did have a similar look to jeans, and she had a purse. It was dark and raining at the scene of the accident but her clothing was similar to the description given by Grabowski. I asked her several more questions and she looked at me and said, &amp;ldquo;funny&amp;rdquo; in an extremely slurred and slow speech. I asked her twice if she would like to conduct field sobriety and she stated no on the second time. Based on this, at approximately 2133 hours I placed her under arrest for DUI / DWI as well as leaving the scene of an attended property damage accident. As I was securing Cornett, the registered owner of the vehicle arrived on scene in a separate vehicle and I identified him as Brian David Moralez (01/14/1984 2/M). He asked me where the vehicle was and I told him that it was in a ditch and that it also struck an ambulance to which he was surprised. He asked if he could get inside the vehicle before it was towed because she had picked dinner up and it was inside the vehicle. At this point, Cornett was starting to yell and become irate stating that I have no proof she was in the vehicle. She was yelling in an extremely slurred speech. Moralez and this time also explained that Cornett was his fianc&amp;eacute; and that they have been together over eleven years and that he could not believe that this was happening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After talking to Moralez I went to secure Cornett in my vehicle and I asked if she was okay to which she replied with, &amp;ldquo;Fuck you&amp;rdquo; several times and would not answer my questions. I secured her in my vehicle and spoke to Maharjan again who stated that he did not see her and did not know she was in the back. I went back outside and spoke to Cornett who was continuously unbuckling her seatbelt and had to be instructed to stop. As I was waiting for the tow, Cornett continued to put her feet on the dash even after being instructed not to several times. Throughout the time Cornett was in the vehicle she put her feet on the dash and was screaming curse words and derogatory remarks towards me. I responded to the barrack and during the transport, Cornett made multiple threats and statements that I would die or be killed and that my family will be killed and more threats against me and my family. Based on some statements she made, I asked if she had ever been diagnosed with a mental health disorder or was having any thoughts of harming herself, and she stated no.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I arrived at the barrack with Cornett, and she was still threatening my life and my family. The odor of an alcoholic beverage had filled my vehicle that had not been present before placing Cornett in the vehicle. She was still talking extremely slurred and asked me if I wanted to fight. A secondary search was conducted at the barrack of her bag and her person. In her bag was a Chrysler key that belonged to the Chrysler involved in the accident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I placed Cornett in the DUI room and played her the DR-15 advice of rights over a computer while also providing her with a physical copy to follow along with. I did this due to the fact that Cornett became extremely hostile anytime I would try and talk or read and I could not read over her talking. Throughout her time in the DUI room, she again was extremely disrespectful, cursing, and making derogatory remarks to every trooper present. In addition to the derogatory remarks, she also made several racist slurs and comments using foul language. She did not stop yelling and had white in the corner of her mouth from yelling so much. At approximately 2238 hours she refused to take the Intoximeter test. I then placed her in the holding cell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moralez picked Cornett up from the barrack and as I went to remove her from the cell, the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage had filled the cell that was not present before placing her in the cell. I brought her to the lobby to issue her the paperwork and she refused to sign all the paperwork. She was released to Moralez.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Throughout my interaction with Cornett, she was extremely disrespectful, threatened my life and my family&amp;#39;s multiple times in multiple different ways, and used racial slurs. Her speech was incoherent, slurred and slow the entire time and her movements were shaky and slow as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grabowski came to the barrack on 03/25 to complete a written statement which has been attached to this report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Wicomico County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;TFC Todd 6929&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
