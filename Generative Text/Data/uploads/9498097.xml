         <NarrativeText>DUI Folder 23-023 &lt;p&gt;This incident was visually and&amp;nbsp;audibly recorded on A-13 in-car camera system and body worn camera.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; VEHICLE IN MOTION:&lt;br /&gt; On Monday, February 20, 2023, at approximately 0113 hours, I responded to the area of northbound Washington Blvd (MD Rt 1) and Freestate Road in Howard County, Maryland. TFC Mohr #6743 was on a traffic stop with a possible impaired driver and requested assistance. When I arrived on scene, I observed a red Toyota Corolla, bearing Maryland registration, &amp;quot;59759CJ&amp;quot; on the right side of the roadway. TFC Mohr advised me that he was conducting speed enforcement in the area and stopped the Toyota for exceeding the speed limit. After stopping the Toyota, TFC Mohr observed signs of impairment and requested another unit. TFC Mohr&amp;#39;s part in this incident is provided in the attached supplement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CONTACT:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I made a driver&amp;#39;s side approach and made contact with the driver who had already been identified as Jesus Evelio Alvarado Contreras, hispanic male DOB 12/15/1985. Alvarado did not speak good English but was able to tell me that he was driving from North Carolina to his residence just a short distance from where he was stopped. I detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle, and Alvarado admitted to consuming two alcoholic beverages. While talking to him, I noticed that Alvarado&amp;#39;s speech was slurred and his eyes were red and glassy. Officer Juarez #6069 from the Howard County Police Department responded to the scene to translate for us. I had Alvarado exit and walk to the front of his vehicle to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.Once in front of his vehicle, I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. Alvarado stated that he stopped at a restaurant in Laurel, Maryland called El Charro where he admitted to consuming five beers. He stated that he did not take any medication and did not have any injuries preventing him from performing the tests. All of my instructions for the test were translated by Officer Juarez.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I explained the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Alvarado. I instructed him to stand with his&amp;nbsp;feet together and his&amp;nbsp;hands down by his&amp;nbsp;sides. I used my pen as a stimulus and held it approximately 12-15 inches from Alvarado&amp;#39;s eyes. I told Alvarado&amp;nbsp;to follow the stimulus with his&amp;nbsp;eyes only and not to move his&amp;nbsp;head. When asked, he stated&amp;nbsp;he understood all instructions. Alvarado displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. I had to tell Alvarado multiple times to not move his head and to keep following the stimulus with his eyes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CLUES: 6&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; WALK AND TURN:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I instructed Alvarado&amp;nbsp;to place his&amp;nbsp;right foot touching heel-to-toe in front of his&amp;nbsp;left foot on the white line with his&amp;nbsp;hands down by his&amp;nbsp;sides.&amp;nbsp;I told him&amp;nbsp;to remain in this position while I explained and demonstrated the test. I then explained to him that he needed to take nine heel-to-toe stepson the white line, count&amp;nbsp;out each step while watching his&amp;nbsp;feet and keep&amp;nbsp;his&amp;nbsp;hands down by his&amp;nbsp;sides. On his&amp;nbsp;ninth step, Alvarado&amp;nbsp;was instructed to leave his&amp;nbsp;lead foot planted and turn around taking a series of small steps. Alvarado&amp;nbsp;was then to take nine heel-to-toe steps back counting out each step with his&amp;nbsp;hands by his&amp;nbsp;sides and to watch his&amp;nbsp;feet. I instructed Alvarado&amp;nbsp;that once he began the test, not to stop until the test was completed.&amp;nbsp;When asked, Alvarado&amp;nbsp;stated he understood all instructions. Alvarado was unable to maintain the instructional position with his right foot touching heel-to-toe in front of his left foot. I had to instruct Alvarado several times to begin the test before he started. On the first set of nine steps, Alvarado missed heel-to-toe and stepped offline on all steps. Alvarado then turned without taking a series of small steps as instructed. On the second set of nine steps, Alvarado missed heel-to-toe and stepped offline on all steps.&amp;nbsp; When Alvarado began the test he had his hands in his pockets. After instructing him to take his hand out of his pockets, he held both of them away from his sides throughout the rest of the test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CLUES: 5&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ONE LEG STAND:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I instructed Alvarado&amp;nbsp;to stand with his&amp;nbsp;feet together and his&amp;nbsp;hands down by his&amp;nbsp;side while I explained and demonstrated the test. I explained to him, he was to use either his&amp;nbsp;left or right leg and hold it approximately six inches off the ground with his&amp;nbsp;toes pointed. Alvarado&amp;nbsp;was then instructed to look at his&amp;nbsp;foot and count out loud one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, etc., until told to stop. I told Alvarado&amp;nbsp;to keep his&amp;nbsp;legs straight and continue counting until I told him&amp;nbsp;to stop.&amp;nbsp;When I&amp;nbsp;finished&amp;nbsp;demonstrating the test, Alvarado&amp;nbsp;stated that he understood all instructions.&amp;nbsp;Alvarado used his right foot for the test. He was unable to hold it six inches off the ground and kept his leg bent and his heel on the ground during the test. Both of Alvarado&amp;#39;s hands were away from his sides throughout the test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CLUES: 2&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Alvarado was advised of his rights to a preliminary breath test, but refused to submit to one. Based on my training, knowledge, and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, I determined Alvarado&amp;nbsp;had been driving under the influence of alcohol and placed him&amp;nbsp;under arrest.&amp;nbsp; After placing Alvarado in my vehicle, I returned to his Toyota where two clear plastic baggies with a white powder substance were in plain view on the front passenger side floorboard.&amp;nbsp; Based on my training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper, I believed them to be Cocaine.&amp;nbsp; A search of the vehicle yielded two more clear plastic baggies with suspected Cocaine on the driver&amp;#39;s side floorboard. In the back seat there were several empty beer cans and one partially full beer can shoved into the back of the passenger seat within reach of the driver. TFC Mohr transported the suspected Cocaine to the Maryland State Police Waterloo Barracks while I returned to my vehicle. Utilizing the MVA website, I played a recording the DR-15 Advice of Rights in spanish for Alvarado while we drove to the Waterloo Barracks. Officer Juarez followed us and once we were at the barracks, Alvarado refused to submit to a breath test at 0220 hours. Alvarado was then transported to the Howard County Central Booking facility and released into their custody with charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; The suspected Cocaine was weighed at 2.4 grams with packaging and verified by Sgt Gailor #1086. It was processed and packaged according to MSP policy and procedures and placed in the barracks temp storage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;7B30DM9: DUI&lt;br /&gt; 7B40DM9:&amp;nbsp;DWI&lt;br /&gt; 7B50DM9: NEGLIGENT&lt;br /&gt; 7B60DM9: RECKLESS&lt;br /&gt; 7B70DM9: CONSUMING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE IN PASSENGER AREA&lt;br /&gt; 7B80DM9: SPEEDING 59/35&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Possession of CDS, not Marijuana.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed by arrest.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Howard&amp;nbsp;County, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>

I was working stationary laser enforcement, focused on northbound traffic, south of Whiskey Bottom Road. I was operating MSP unit &amp;ldquo;A-5&amp;rdquo;, a black, un-marked Ford Explorer police vehicle, equipped with red and blue electronic lights along with a siren. I was dressed in the uniform of the day while on patrol. I am trained and certified in using a LIDAR speed-measuring device. I was operating a Kustom Signals Pro Laser III device, specifically, &amp;ldquo;Set 1,&amp;quot; which I am trained and certified to use. Said LIDAR was calibrated for accuracy before and after my tour of duty. At the above time and location, I was stopped on Brewer&amp;#39;s Court, not obstructing traffic, observing passing traffic. My headlights and taillights were on. I observed a red Toyota Corolla, displaying Maryland registration, &amp;ldquo;59759CJ&amp;rdquo; traveling toward my location and had appeared to be traveling over the posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour. I utilized the LIDAR unit, &amp;ldquo;Set 1&amp;rdquo;, to confirm my suspicion that the Toyota was traveling at a speed above 35 miles per hour. I captured a readout on the LIDAR unit: 59 miles per hour, at 191 feet away from my position. The Toyota passed my stationary location in lane one. I got behind the Toyota, activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop. The Toyota was slow to pull over to the right shoulder and did so north of Maier Road. I exited my patrol vehicle and approached the driver&amp;#39;s door.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;PHASE II, PERSONAL CONTACT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I made contact with the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, and immediately identified a language barrier. The driver rarely made eye contact with me during our interaction. He made an attempt to reach for his license and I could identify that he had more than one Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license inside his wallet. I observed multiple open, consumed &amp;quot;Modelo,&amp;quot; beer cans in the back seat area. I reached for the license and returned to my patrol vehicle. I identified the driver by his Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license as Jesus Evelio Alvarado-Contreras, DOB: 12/15/1985. I radioed for an additional unit and Senior Trooper Allen #5820 responded to my location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Senior Trooper Allen responded to my location and resumed the traffic stop. This concludes my role in this investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Howard County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
