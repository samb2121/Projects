         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;On 3/10/2023 I received this case for investigation from Lt Sigmund, McHenry Barrack.&amp;nbsp; Lt. Sigmund had received a direct call from the complainants father and asked for guidance with regard to the following potential crime and investigation.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Due to the above request, I set up an interview with the victim/complainant for 3/13/2023.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:22px"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jalynn Sherbin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;On 3/13/2023 I interviewed victim/complaint, Jalynn Sherbin(18 years old).&amp;nbsp; The interview took place at the McHenry Barrack conference room.&amp;nbsp; Also present during the interview was Master Trooper Romanchak and the father of the victim, John Sherbin.&amp;nbsp; The interview was audibly recorded. The following is not a complete transcription of the interview in its entirety.&amp;nbsp; A copy of the interview in its entirety will be kept on CD in the barrack case file.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Jalynn Sherbin stated that last Thursday around 9 O&amp;#39;clock she was added by a fake snap chat account named &amp;quot;jamesomg23&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; She accepts the friend request.&amp;nbsp; They continue to text asking if she knows who they were.&amp;nbsp; It started out like nothing but then started talking about a girl in her class named Katelyn Wakefield.&amp;nbsp; Unknown user starts talking about spreading her(Sherbin&amp;#39;s) nudes because she has a nice body.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin pulls the text thread up and allows me to read it.&amp;nbsp; It refers to numerous family members of the victim and that if she(J Sherbin) does not do what is asked, they will spread her pics to them.&amp;nbsp; The unknown user sends Sherbin a pic of a naked butt.&amp;nbsp; She could not fully see a face but Sherbin stated that it looked like her(Wakefield).&amp;nbsp; Sherbin contacts Wakefield via text and tells her about the unusual text and pic.&amp;nbsp; Wakefield does not respond back to Sherbin.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin informs me that her and Wakefield are classmates but not really friends and more enemies.&amp;nbsp; The text threads between Sherbin and the unknown user go on for quite a while.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin eventually screenshots the text thread and sends them to this investigator by email. The text thread continued for a few days.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The text thread basically consists of the unknown user asking Jalynn Sherbin to give her pics and states that he/she has video of her and will send it to friends and family.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin disputes the fact that the suspect has any video or nude pics as she has never done that.&amp;nbsp; Suspect attempts to convince her that he does and says that he is one of her ex-partners.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin again disputes, as she had never allowed anyone to take pics or video and has had limited opportunity for this to have ever happened.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Sherbin stated that she has an idea who unknown user/suspect may be and stated that her ex-boyfriend(Christian Frazee, 19 years old) could have video, but she had never consented to allowing anyone to take a video.&amp;nbsp; She doesn&amp;#39;t feel that he had opportunity to do this but has no other person that could have done it.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Unknown suspect stated that he/she sent videos to her friends, but none of her friends have received anything to her knowledge.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Unknown suspect also sends Sherbin&amp;#39;s brother(Jordan Sherbin) a very blury video and claims that it is of Jalynn Sherbin.&amp;nbsp; According to victim Sherbin, her brother could not confirm that the video is of her.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin stated that she has had very little contact with Frazee since they broke up August 2022.&amp;nbsp; Unknown suspect just keeps asking her for a picture of her face and just wanted her to do what he wants.&amp;nbsp; Unknown suspect never really tells Sherbin what he wants.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin eventually and regretfully does send the unknown user a picture of her face.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin thinks it could be more than one person who have come up with the scheme.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Sherbin provides the names of Alexia Van Sheets, and Katelyn Wakefield as people of interests, as she has been having some issues with them in school, and they are acquaintances of her ex-boyfriend, Frazee.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin described them as enemies of hers.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Sherbin provided me with her Snap Chat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Sherbin stated that her mom also added the unknown user, jamesomg23.&amp;nbsp; The suspect told her mom that Jalynn better listen to him/her because girls sometimes harm themselves over things like this.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Suspect also sends victims mom a link to a porn site and states that her daughter is on it.&amp;nbsp; Suspect also sends brother Jordan Sherbin a Snap request.&amp;nbsp; He excepts.&amp;nbsp; Suspect sent brother Jordan a video of two people having sex.&amp;nbsp; He could not identify his sister in the alleged video.&amp;nbsp; The background of the video was also cropped out.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Only thing Jorden could see was the guys legs in the video.&amp;nbsp; I acquired Jordan&amp;#39;s phone number for further clarification.&amp;nbsp; Jorden Sherbin&amp;#39;s wife, Sara Sherbin, also was contacted by Jamesomg23.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Jalynn Sherbin asks her dad to leave interview room, so she can be more upfront with me about facts.&amp;nbsp; Jalynn Sherbin then describes an incident last year when she saw something on Christian&amp;#39;s(potential suspect) phone in text format.&amp;nbsp; The text led her to believe that Christian may have done something illegal to his brother, and she ends the relationship. Other people find out about the allegations against Christian, for what he may have done to his brother, and she feels that Christian may be trying to get even with her.&amp;nbsp; Victim has only seen the alleged suspect once since August, and they did not even speak, but she describes him as creepy.&amp;nbsp; Victim Sherbin stated that if a video was made without her knowledge, it would have definitely been in West Virginia at Christians mother house near the Hazleton prison.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Victim then stated that she got a call from a friend(Destiny Ritchie) yesterday(3/12/2023).&amp;nbsp; She told the victim that she was sent the same video that was sent to her brother.&amp;nbsp; She seems to think that it may have been a video of her and it was sent through Facebook Messenger.&amp;nbsp; The victim stated that she did not want me to contact Destiny Ritchie because Ritchie did not want to be involved.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A phone call was made to the victims mother, Michelle Sherbin.&amp;nbsp; She provided me an email with her communication with jamesomg23.&amp;nbsp; She stated that the porn link is gone, and she did not observe her daughter on the site.&amp;nbsp; The victims mother believes that ex-boyfriend, Christian may be jamesomg23.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A preservation letter/request was made for Snap Chat account Jamesomg23.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I received a follow-up email from Snap Chat confirming the request.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case open for further investigation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;On 3/16/2023 I had a phone interview with the victims brothers, Jordan Sherbin (here in referred to as Jordan).&amp;nbsp; Jordan currently resides in San Diego California with his wife Sara.&amp;nbsp; Jordan said that he received an unknown snap chat friend request last week from jamesomg23.&amp;nbsp; He received a video of two people having sex in the doggy style position from the username.&amp;nbsp; The known user said in the snap to Jordan &amp;quot;this is Jalynn, she is a little whore&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Jordan stated that they communicated back and forth, but no threats were made.&amp;nbsp; Jordan stated that the video was cropped out, and you could not see any descriptors as far as location being filmed.&amp;nbsp; Jordan stated that it definitely looked as if the male party was filming by using a cell phone and the phoebe was in his hand.&amp;nbsp; Jordan said that the room looked dark, and the sexual position was described as &amp;quot;doggy style&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; No faces could be seen, and the unknown couple appeared to be on the floor and definitely not a bed. Both parties were naked.&amp;nbsp; The male appeared to be heavy or overweight and harry legs.&amp;nbsp; The female appeared to be a tall skinny white girl with blonde hair according to Jordan.&amp;nbsp; Jordan could not definitely identify the female party as his sister.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Jordan stated that he continued to snap with the unknown user.&amp;nbsp; He found it odd that the user knew specific family details that were not publicly known.&amp;nbsp; Jordan said that the user talked about his wife(Sara) and knew that she was pregnant.&amp;nbsp; According to Jordan, no one but close family had knowledge of his wife being pregnant.&amp;nbsp; Jordan stated that the communication ended with jamesomg23.&amp;nbsp; Jordan feels that the unknown user(suspect) may be Christian Frazee and Alexia Van Sheets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 3/21/2023 I drove to Hazleton West Virginia in an attempt to interview alleged suspect, Christian Frazee.&amp;nbsp; I made contact with Frazee&amp;#39;s mother, Jodi Frazee.&amp;nbsp; She informed me that Christian had moved out and now resides in Morgantown West Virginia, unknown address.&amp;nbsp; She did not have an updated phone number for him but stated that her daughter still keeps in touch with him, and she has contact info.&amp;nbsp; Jodi Frazee stated that she would get the contact information for me when her daughter gets home from school.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:24px"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Christian Frazee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;On 3/31/2023 at approximately 0924 hours, I interviewed alleged suspect Christian Frazee (herein referred to as Frazee).&amp;nbsp; The interview was held at his mothers residence located at 1130 Casteel Road, Bruceton Mills, West Virginia, in the kitchen area.&amp;nbsp; Frazee provided me with some personal information before the interview started.&amp;nbsp; Frazee currently resides at 263 Taylor Street, Morgantown West Virginia(phone # 681-270-9904).&amp;nbsp; Frazee advised that he is currently employed as a painter in Morgantown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The following is a synopsis of the interview and is not a complete transcription of the interview.&amp;nbsp; A copy of the interview in its entirety will be placed on CD and help in the barrack case file.&amp;nbsp; Frazee was informed that the interview would be audibly recorded of which he consented.&amp;nbsp; Frazee was Mirandized using an MSP Form-180, Advice of Miranda Rights.&amp;nbsp; Frazee signed the form and agreed to speak with me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:18px"&gt;Frazee was asked if he knew why I needed to speak with him.&amp;nbsp; Frazee was not sure. I informed him that I was investigating a complaint of harassment and potential distribution of pornography.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Frazee immediately stated &amp;quot;ah I think I know what your talking about, Jalynn Sherbin&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Frazee said that she texted him.&amp;nbsp; He said it was on March 9th and looked back at his phone to verify the date.&amp;nbsp; He said that she asked if he ever took a video of them having sex.&amp;nbsp; He said that they texted via messenger that day but have not communicated since.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Frazee said that they dated for approximately eight or nine months in 2022. He moved to Texas, and they broke up.&amp;nbsp; I informed Frazee that I was interviewing him because he was one of her sexual partners and was one of a few individuals that could have been able to produce /send a video as described.&amp;nbsp; I asked Frazee if he and Sherbin ever had sex.&amp;nbsp; Frazee admitted that they did, and he said that it occurred at her house every time except once, when they had sexual relations at his mothers house.&amp;nbsp; I asked if he and Sherbin ever talked bout filming while having sex.&amp;nbsp; He said that one time they did, but they never actually followed through with it.&amp;nbsp; It was only brought up once and never again.&amp;nbsp; Frazee denied ever filming any sexual activity between the two of them, not even a kiss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked Frazee if he was familiar with the snap chat account jamesomg123.&amp;nbsp; Frazee denied any knowledge of that snap chat account. I asked Frazee if he has contacted Jalynn Sherbin or her mother recently via Snap Chat.&amp;nbsp; Frazee again denied and stated that he has a new snap chat account and has not communicated with them.&amp;nbsp; Frazee said that when he got his new Snap Chat account he did attempt to add Jalynn Sherbin, but she never added him back.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Frazee provided me with his new Snap Chat account name, harryballs21419.&amp;nbsp; He provided me with his old Snap Chat account of cfrazee95.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked Frazee if he&amp;#39;s aware of anyone who would be capable of performing this type of harassment and other crimes.&amp;nbsp; Frazee said that he believes she was dating a guy by the name of Alex Stahl from Preston County, but that&amp;#39;s all he knows about that.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;#39;s not sure if he would do anything such as these accusations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I questioned Frazee about a few other names that have popped up during my investigation.&amp;nbsp; I asked Frazee if he knew Alexia Van Scheets.&amp;nbsp; He stated that he never met her.&amp;nbsp; He does know an Alexia from Friendsville but doesn&amp;#39;t know her last name.&amp;nbsp; Frazee said that he has hung out with her a couple of times.&amp;nbsp; I asked him when the last time he saw her was. Frazee said that he helped her move the other day.&amp;nbsp; He said she was moving into an apartment with her friend, Sara Roberts.&amp;nbsp; Frazee described Van Scheets as more of an acquaintance and less than a friend.&amp;nbsp; He said he never texted her and maybe sees her five times a month when she is with her boyfriend, Jesse Stone, a common friend from Bruceton Mills.&amp;nbsp; I asked Frazee if during interaction with Alexia Van Scheets, does she ever bring up Jalynn&amp;#39;s name.&amp;nbsp; Frazee said that she never does, because they do not like each other.&amp;nbsp; He said that they did have a past, but he never knew what the issue was and never got into it with Jaylynn during his relationship with her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked Frazee about other names that have popped up during my investigation.&amp;nbsp;I brought up the name, Katelyn Wakefield.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Frazee was familiar with her.&amp;nbsp; He said that she goes to Northern.&amp;nbsp; He said that Jaylynn would call her a bitch and did not like her during their time together.&amp;nbsp; He said that he only ever saw her once, and it was a Smiley&amp;#39;s Restaurant in McHenry. Frazee said that the last time he saw her was that one time at Smiley&amp;#39;s.&amp;nbsp; Frazee said that he does not text /snap her at all and does not believe he even has her on his snap chat and does not look her up.&amp;nbsp; He said that he has absolutely no contact with her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I once again gave Frazee the opportunity to be honest with me about the Snap Chat account with username jamesomg123.&amp;nbsp; Frazee again denied any knowledge of that account and ever sending vids/pics of him and Jalynn have sexual relations or any other.&amp;nbsp; I asked Frazee if he has ever had communication with Jalynn&amp;#39;s brother, Jordan Sherbin.&amp;nbsp; Frazee said that he did talk to him once.&amp;nbsp; He said that when he turned eighteen, he communicated with Jordan about military questions while he was still dating Jalynn.&amp;nbsp; Frazee was asked again if he knows anyone else who could have been capable of being involved in the alleged crimes.&amp;nbsp; Frazee could not provide any information that was pertinent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The interview ended.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Frazee was advised to not communicate with Jalynn Sherbin in any form.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It should be noted that during the last week of March 2023, I attempted to contact Katelyn Wakefield, at her residence in Grantsville Maryland.&amp;nbsp; I was met with negative results but spoke with her mother, and will be contacting her in the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case open for further investigation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Since last report, I&amp;#39;ve attempted on numerous occasions to contact victim Sherbin by phone and have been met with negative results. The phone number provided by the victim is not excepting messages.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After numerous failed attempts, myself among with MT Romanchak traveled to 255 Pysell Apartments Apt 52, McHenry MD and made contact with Sherbin and her mother.&amp;nbsp; I asked her if she has had any additional communication with her ex-boyfriend or trouble with her schoolmates.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin advised that other than the occasional snide remark things have calmed down.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin is a recent graduate and is looking forward to starting the next chapter of her life.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin has had no contact with her ex-boyfriend since ur last conversation.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Due to the limited opportunity for the alleged crime to have occurred, the fact that the alleged crime most likely would have occurred in another state/jurisdiction, and the lack of continued contact and/or harassment by the alleged suspect, the case will be closed unfounded.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin was advised of the case status.&amp;nbsp; Sherbin advised that she is ready to move on.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Case closed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
