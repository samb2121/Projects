         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 12/2/2023, I, Trooper Rowe (#7015), responded to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barrack for the report of a fraud. Upon my arrival, I made contact with the complainant and victim, Thomas James Evans identified by his Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license. Evans advised me that he was on his computer on 12/1/2023 at approximately 1500 hours, when his screen went black with a pop-up from Microsoft advising his computer had been hacked. The pop-up provided a number to call and Evans called the number to get his computer fixed. The number claimed to be Microsoft as well and stated that his computer was hacked and then transferred Evens to another person. This person claimed they were with the Department of Justice Fraud Department. This person told Evans that $5,000 had been mistakenly transferred to his account. They instructed Evans to go to his bank and withdraw the $5,000 in cash. Evans was then told to go to a specialized ATM for BitCoin located at 12238 Pulaski Hwy, Kingsville, MD. Once at the ATM Evans was instructed to deposit the $5,000 into the ATM and scan a QR code that the scammer provided Evans with. This transferred the $5,000 cash into BitCoin currency and transferred the funds to the scammer. The scammers also had Evens download an app to give the scammer remote access to Evans&amp;#39; phone. Using this remote access the scammer obtained Evans credit card information. I had Evans freeze his accounts for all the cards and notify his banks of the fraudulent activity. I also assisted Evans with contacting the ATM company, BitCoin Depot. While on the phone with the BitCoin Depot, they advised that the money had been transferred, and he can not get it transferred back as the transaction was immediate. I asked them if they had the information for the account that the money was transferred to. They advised the accounts for BitCoin Depot are anonymous and can not be traced. I was able to assist Evans with starting the refund process. I advised Evans to not contact the number the scammer was using again and to freeze his cards that were compromised. Evans was provided a case number and told to follow up with the BitCoin Depot for the refund of his money and to continue working with his bank&amp;#39;s fraud department.&lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; I request this case closed due to no additional leads.</NarrativeText>
