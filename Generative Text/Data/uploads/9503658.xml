         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;ATTACHMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Washington County CPS Intake Worksheet, placed in case file.&lt;br /&gt; 2.) CD of Forensic Interview with alleged victim, placed in MSP Hagerstown Temp Storage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On 1/30/2023, I, Sgt. Angermeier was notified by Washington County CPS of an incoming case of alleged child sex abuse. It was reported that Kamryn Plaza, 4 YOA disclosed that her mother&amp;#39;s boyfriend, Harley Donovan Brooks Jr, 35 YOA had touched Kamryn on her vagina. It was also reported to CPS that Kamryn&amp;#39;s mother, Madyson Plaza, 21 YOA, had filed a protective order on Brooks Jr due to domestic violence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 2/2/2023 at approximately 1344 hours, Case Worker Kris Hoffman conducted a forensic interview with Kamryn at the Washington County CAC. I was present for the interview in the observation room as well as CAC Supervisor Rachel Mazloum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; BELOW ARE THE INTERVIEW NOTES FROM CPS SUPERVISOR RACHEL MAZLOUM. SEE THE RECORDED INTERVIEW ON CD FOR FURTHER DETAILS.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker began with rapport building. Kamryn was hard to understand at times because of her age, but she did appear developmentally on target. Kamryn shared that mommy was crying because daddy is &amp;ldquo;not nice&amp;rdquo; and he needs to go to &amp;ldquo;jail&amp;rdquo;. She said mommy called the police on daddy. She said daddy was smoking when asked why he needed to go to jail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker asked about touches she likes and doesn&amp;rsquo;t like. She didn&amp;rsquo;t list any touches she likes. For touches she doesn&amp;rsquo;t like, she didn&amp;rsquo;t answer and asked to color. Worker presented the anatomically correct drawings of the male and female. Kamryn was able to label various body parts, such as the nose, mouth, hand. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to label the breasts. She labelled the belly button as the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo;. She labelled the vagina as the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; and the buttocks as the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo;. On the male drawing, she labelled the male chest as the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo;, and the penis as the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo;. Worker asked her if anyone touched her on the body parts on the picture. She pointed to the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; to be the vagina and the female chest. Worker asked who did it, and she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t know, and worker asked what they did, and she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t know. Worker asked who touched her chest, and she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t know. Worker asked her again who touched her in those parts, and she said daddy. She said daddy touched her on her &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; and pointed to her vagina. Worker asked what he used to touch her butt. Kamryn was not understanding the question and couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer other than to say he touched her. She eventually said she didn&amp;rsquo;t know. Worker asked what he did when he touched her, and she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t know. Worker asked if he said anything, and she didn&amp;rsquo;t answer. Worker asked where she was when daddy touched her and she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t know. Worker asked if she told anyone about it, and she said yes, and then said she didn&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker exited the interview room to speak to observers and then re-entered. Worker got out the anatomically correct dolls. Kamryn was able to note one of the dolls that looked like her. When she saw the anatomical dolls of the male, and the penis was shown when showing what body parts they have, Kamryn noted that Daddy has a penis. Worker gave her the one doll as representing Kamryn and the other doll to represent Daddy and asked her to show how daddy touched her. Kamryn was not able to show with the dolls what daddy did. Kamryn said she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about the &amp;ldquo;butts&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker asked her to show how daddy touched her with the dolls. Kamryn used her hand to make a motion on her own vagina. Worker tried many times to have Kamryn tell worker how daddy touched her or what he used and Kamryn was not able to share.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The interview then concluded.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After the interview was over, I spoke with Kamryn&amp;#39;s mother, Madyson. She advised Brook&amp;#39;s Jr has 8 years back up time in prison from previous drug charges. She stated Brook&amp;#39;s Jr has four children to three women. Madyson went on to explain that her final protective order hearing is on 2/7/23 and is concerned for her saftey. CW Hoffman conducted a Domestic Violence Screening with Madyson. After speaking with Madyson, she elected to get an attorney for protective order hearing and future events such as child custody. Madyson explained that Brooks Jr would give Kamryn baths, and he would tell her that he would not wash her vaginal area because he did not want to touch that area. She advised that Kamryn would try to see Brooks Jr in the shower and try to touch his penis after he showered while he had on a towel. Madyson advised that after Kamryn&amp;#39;s SAFE exam, there was no indication of trauma to her vaginal area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Many attempts to speak with Brooks Jr have been made with Brooks Jr failing to contact this investigator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ASA Christine Remsburg was briefed on the case and advised there is not enough for charges in this case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed, lack of prosecution.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Washington County, MD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
