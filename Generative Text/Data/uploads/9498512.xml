         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 9/21/2023 members of the Frederick HIDTA conducted a prostitution and human trafficking operation. The operation was held at the Clarion Hotel located at 5400 Holiday Drive, Frederick, MD 21703. M/Tpr. Hood was working in an undercover capacity for the operation and was tasked with getting women to come to his hotel room for sexual favors in exchange for money. During the duration of the night DFC Constatine was going to be interviewing the women and getting them the needed resources if they were being trafficked. During the hours of 1300-2200 hours, four (4) different women agreed to come to the hotel room and meet with Hood and one asked Hood to come to her room located at the Econo Lodge located in Frederick City Maryland. All the women who met with Hood agreed to a sexual act for an amount of money however none of the women advised they were being trafficked. All the women met with on the given date and time advised they had a drug problem and that was the main reason they were prostituting themselves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One of the women who met with Hood explained she frequents the Clarion and that she was contacted by a man in the lobby who she knows due to his drug dealing activity. The woman advised the man had asked her on the way to meet with Hood if he could trade her sex for some crack cocaine, and she advised he was already on the way to a &amp;quot;date&amp;quot;. The woman advised she would be willing to introduce Hood to the man in the lobby described as &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;. M/Tpr. Hood and the woman then walked to the lobby area of the hotel and met with a large black male that was identified by the female as &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;. She hugged the man a hug and asked him if he could &amp;quot;hook up&amp;quot; M/Tpr. Hood with something, meaning crack cocaine. The man known as &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; then told M/Tpr. Hood to walk out to his car and talk about it. M/Tpr. Hood agreed to meet with &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; outside and was able to exchange phone numbers. M/Tpr. Hood and &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; then left the area. M/Tpr. Hood will be contacting &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; at a later date and time for a controlled buy for an amount of CDS crack cocaine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All the above events occurred in Frederick County Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
