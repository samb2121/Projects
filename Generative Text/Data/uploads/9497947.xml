         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Photographs of injuries can be found in &amp;quot;Attachments.&amp;quot; I received photographs and videos from the victim&amp;#39;s mother and his friend. These photographs can also be found in &amp;quot;Attachments.&amp;quot; Copies of video footage are to be submitted to the North East Barrack property room (to be documented on a supplement to follow this initial report). A copy of the juvenile referral form and served arrest warrant can be found in &amp;quot;Attachments.&amp;quot; The juvenile referral was submitted to the Maryland State Police North East Barrack to be mailed to the Juvenile Services Administration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;A traditional neighborhood check was not conducted. However, between approximately 1645 and 1705 hours on January 14, 2023, I made telephone calls to Susan &amp;quot;Evie&amp;quot; Hubbard (DOB: 04/18/2001) and Hailey Hutzel (DOB: 03/27/2001). All calls were made from the North East Barrack recorded telephone line. Susan is a friend of the victim&amp;#39;s, and Hailey was hosting the party in which the assault occurred.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Susan told me she did not see the start of the assault. However, she told me the victim was assaulted by three males. She attempted to step in to break up the fight, and sustained a cut to her right hand in the process. She advised she did not need medical attention for the cut to her hand. Susan said she believes the first names of the suspects are &amp;quot;Anthony,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Blake,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nate.&amp;quot; I provided Susan with my contact information and requested she send me any photographs and/or videos she has.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Hailey told me she did not witness the assault. She told me she does not know who the male suspects are. However, she said she thinks a friend of hers named &amp;quot;Robbie&amp;quot; may have invited them. I provided her with my contact information and requested she contact Robbie and attempt to get identifying information for the male suspects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also attempted to call the homeowner for the location of the assault, named by the victim&amp;#39;s mother as &amp;quot;Jessica Joines.&amp;quot; I was unable to make contact via telephone, and left a voice mail requesting she call me back through the barrack telephone line.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I received &amp;quot;Robbie&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; telephone number via my government email (from Hailey). I called Robbie at approximately 1806 hours from the North East Barrack recorded line. Robbie identified himself as Robert Williams (DOB: 03/03/2000). He told me did not personally see the fight, but did see video footage of it. He identified two of the suspects as &amp;quot;Nate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Blake&amp;quot; (saying he was certain that&amp;#39;s who they are based on the video and his time at the party). He said the &amp;quot;Blake&amp;quot; subject is named Blake Greathouse.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I was advised at the North East Barrack that a Blake Michael Greathouse 2nd (see &amp;quot;Suspect Two&amp;quot;) returns a record. When I compared his MVA photograph to the Facebook photograph provided to me by Wendy (via email), it appeared to me the faces and ears of the male subjects in each photograph matched. I called Wendy at approximately 1831 hours on January 14, 2023 to speak with Ivan. Wendy passed Ivan the telephone and he told me he did view the Facebook photograph of Blake. He told me he is certain Blake is one of his assailants. He described Blake as being approximately seventeen or eighteen years old and believes he lives in Conowingo. I noticed on Blake&amp;#39;s driving record that his address is listed as &amp;quot;4 Meadowood, Conowingo, Maryland.&amp;quot; When I checked a map of the area, this address also appears as 4 Meadow Wood Drive, Conowingo, Maryland 21918. Blake&amp;#39;s date of birth also places him at seventeen years old, matching what Ivan described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Robert further told me he did not invite Blake. As for Anthony, Robert said his last name may be &amp;quot;Larson.&amp;quot; Robert was unable to provide contact information for the suspects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;SUSPECT ONE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;NAME: NATHAN LOGAN REEVES (W/M)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; DATE OF BIRTH: OCTOBER 23, 2004 (AGE AT INCIDENT: 18 YEARS)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ADDRESS: 99 MCCORMICK DRIVE, PORT DEPOSIT, MD 21904&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; MARYLAND SOUNDEX: R120622535817&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DATE/TIME OF ARREST: JANUARY 16, 2023 AT APPROXIMATELY 2006 HOURS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;SUSPECT TWO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;NAME: BLAKE MICHAEL GREATHOUSE 2ND (W/M)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DATE OF BIRTH: JUNE 22, 2005 (AGE AT INCIDENT: 17 YEARS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; LAST KNOWN ADDRESS: 4 MEADOWOOD, CONOWINGO, MARYLAND 21918&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DATE OF JUVENILE REFERRAL: JANUARY 15, 2023&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;VICTIM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;NAME: IVAN ELISEO HERRERA (W/M)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DATE OF BIRTH: NOVEMBER 28, 2000&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ADDRESS: 1940 JACOB TOME MEMORIAL HIGHWAY, PORT DEPOSIT, MARYLAND&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;TELEPHONE: 410-920-2200&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;On January 14, 2023, at approximately 1447 hours, I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217) of the Maryland State Police, was dispatched to 1940 Jacob Tome Memorial Highway, Port Deposit, Maryland 21904 in response to an assault. I arrived on scene at approximately 1710 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant, Wendy Herrera (W/F; DOB: 03/28/1981). Wendy called on behalf of her son, Ivan Herrera (see &amp;quot;Victim&amp;quot;). Wendy told me her son was assaulted in the early hours of January 14, 2023. She allowed me into her home to make contact with Ivan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Immediately upon meeting with Ivan, I observed he had obvious injuries to his face. The injuries were fresh. They are as follows:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - MISSING FRONT TOOTH&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - SWOLLEN UPPER LIP&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - BRUISING/ABRASION TO HIS FACE (PRIMARILY THE LEFT SIDE)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - INJURY TO HIS&amp;nbsp;LEFT EYE (BLOOD SHOT, BLOOD POOLED TOWARDS THE OUTER CORNER OF THE EYE ITSELF).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Ivan also had splotches of his blood on his jeans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Emergency Medical Services was called for Ivan as a precaution. He refused medical transport, and was advised to call emergency medical services later if issues develop. I also recommended he consult a doctor for his injuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; When I interviewed Ivan and his family, I gathered the assault occurred at approximately 0050 hours on January 14, 2023. The assault occurred during a party held at 87 Billy Goss Loop, North East, Maryland 21901. I was initially told Ivan was assaulted by three males.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ivan told me alcohol was served at the party, but he met the suspects while he was still sober. The assault occurred later in the party. He told me he recalls saying something (unspecified) about someone&amp;#39;s sister. At that point, he was assaulted by Nathan Logan Reeves (see &amp;quot;Suspect One&amp;quot;) and (as I gathered later) another suspect. I was first given a name of &amp;quot;Nate Reeves.&amp;quot; After I requested an MVA browse of &amp;quot;Nate Reeves&amp;quot; through the Maryland State Police North East Barrack, I was given a name of Nathan Logan Reeves. I was able to find an MVA photograph of Nathan Logan Reeves and display it to Ivan. He told me he is certain Nathan is one of his assailants. He also suggested the other two suspects may be named &amp;quot;Anthony&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Blake,&amp;quot; but was unable to verify further during our conversation. After further investigation, it could only be confirmed he was assaulted by two suspects, the other being the &amp;quot;Blake&amp;quot; individual. Blake was later identified as Blake Greathouse 2nd (see &amp;quot;Suspect Two&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Neighborhood Check&amp;quot;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Wendy displayed videos of the altercation on her cellular phone. I provided her my government email and asked her to send me copies for evidentiary purposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One video I viewed (which appeared to be recorded by a suspect), showed Ivan backed against a door. The suspect grabs Ivan&amp;#39;s left wrist and verbally harasses him before letting go of that wrist and slapping Ivan across the face. Ivan appears to attempt to retaliate soon after.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Another video I viewed depicted the altercation in progress. It depicted Ivan being assaulted by what appears to be two males, who were simultaneously beating him. A female steps in (who I gathered is Susan based on what she told me about breaking up the fight).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; A third video I received shows Ivan just after the assault ceased. His face is covered in his own blood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also received Ring doorbell camera footage that depicts Ivan on the front porch after the assault. He is being tended to by two females, and his face is bloodied. Ivan can be heard saying &amp;quot;what the fuck was that?&amp;quot; (it can be assumed he is referring to the assault). He also mentions the damage to his teeth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Ivan told me he wants his assailants criminally charged for assaulting him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I used TransUnion TLOxp to research Nathan Reeves. I located a telephone number for a Sandi Reeves. I called at approximately 1919 hours on January 14, 2023 and received an answer. When I asked to speak to Nathan Reeves, the telephone was passed to him. I spoke to him via the barrack recorded line. Nathan told me he was in the described altercation. However, he said Ivan made an insulting comment about Nathan&amp;#39;s sister. Nathan claims he then stood up and shoved Ivan. He and Ivan then proceeded towards the door of the residence before Ivan swung his fist at Nathan. The two then exchanged blows. Nathan claims Ivan&amp;#39;s friends attempted to step in and fight, and then Nathan&amp;#39;s friends joined in Nathan&amp;#39;s defense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I asked Nathan if he is aware there is a video. He denied being aware of this. The video did not seem to depict the events as Nathan described them, and showed Ivan being grabbed and cornered first before throwing a punch. It also looked like the fight was between the two males and Ivan, and I did not get the impression there was another set of males involved (involved so far as fighting, there were some that appeared to attempt to break up the fight).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I called Ivan back and questioned him further. He told me Nathan shoved him before Ivan went towards the door. He said Nathan started recording on his cellular phone before slapping Ivan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I applied for charges against Nathan Reeves based on the following:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Wendy called the Maryland State Police and advised her son, Ivan, was assaulted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - I made contact with Ivan at his residence. He had obvious injuries to his face, left eye, and mouth (to include at least one missing tooth).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Ivan advised one of his assailants was a &amp;quot;Nate Reeves.&amp;quot; He said he met Nate prior to the fight when he was still sober.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - When I spoke to Robert and Susan, both named a suspect as &amp;quot;Nate.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - An MVA browse revealed a Nathan Logan Reeves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - I displayed an MVA photograph of Nathan Logan Reeves to Ivan. Ivan told me he is certain Nathan Logan Reeves is one of his assailants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - I viewed video footage pertaining to the time of the assault. It depicted Ivan being grabbed and slapped across his face, before he attempted to retaliate. Subsequent video showed him being beaten by two males.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Nathan admitted to shoving Ivan first. His statements also appeared inconsistent with video footage I viewed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Later investigation (see &amp;quot;Closing Remarks&amp;quot;) resulted in Ivan and Robert both identifying Nathan in video footage as the assailant wearing a gray sweatshirt and white ball cap. They were both certain this person is Nathan (who is seen beating Ivan on camera).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Based on the totality of the above circumstances, there is probable cause to believe Nathan Logan Reeves assaulted Ivan, contributing to injuries to his left eye, face, and the loss of at least one of his teeth. Based on video footage, the extent of injuries, and the confirmed involvement of two males fighting against Ivan, it does not appear Nathan fought Ivan in self-defense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I applied for criminal charges against Nathan Reeves on January 15, 2023.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;JUVENILE REFERRAL FOR GREATHOUSE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;On January 15, 2023, at approximately 1452 hours, I visited 4 Meadowood, Conowingo, Maryland to attempt to make contact with Blake Greathouse 2nd. I noticed when I initially knocked on the residence, the front door seemed slightly ajar, and closed immediately when I announced myself as a police officer. I made further attempts to knock and make contact, and was eventually greeted by Tabitha Jean Hutchins (W/F; DOB: 01/05/1984). Tabitha told me she is Blake&amp;#39;s mother and legal guardian. She told me she has not seen Blake for a couple of days and claimed to not know his telephone number.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Having made contact with Blake&amp;#39;s mother, I completed a juvenile referral for Blake with Tabitha and provided her with a copy, to include my name/rank/identification number, the case number, and barrack telephone number. I completed a juvenile referral based on the following facts:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Ivan had multiple injuries and advised he was attacked by multiple males suspects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Video footage shows Ivan being assaulted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; -&amp;nbsp;Ivan suggested one of his assailants was named &amp;quot;Blake.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Susan told me she believed one of the suspects to be named &amp;quot;Blake.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Robert further identified &amp;quot;Blake&amp;quot; as Blake Greathouse, and accused Blake of being an assailant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Wendy sent me a Facebook photograph of Blake Greathouse, which she claimed Ivan viewed and confirmed to be one of his attackers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - I spoke to Ivan via telephone and he confirmed he did view Blake Greathouse&amp;#39;s Facebook photograph. He said he was certain Greathouse is a match for one of his assailants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - When I compared an MVA photograph of Blake Greathouse 2nd to the Facebook photograph I was provided, Blake Greathouse 2nd appeared to be a facial match for the Facebook photograph.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - I gathered during my investigation that Blake Greathouse allegedly lives in Conowingo, Maryland. Greathouse 2nd has a listed address of 4 Meadowood, Conowingo, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - I encountered Hutchins at 4 Meadowood, and she claimed to be Greathouse 2nd&amp;#39;s mother. This confirms his residence in Conowingo, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; - Ivan described Blake (his attacker) as approximately seventeen to eighteen years old. Blake Greathouse&amp;#39;s date of birth places him at seventeen years old.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Based on the totality of the above circumstances, there is probable cause to believe Blake Greathouse 2nd is one of the males who assaulted Ivan. Greathouse 2nd was referred to Juvenile Services for Assault - Second Degree.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CLOSING REMARKS:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;I called Ivan on January 15, 2023 at approximately 1630 hours from the North East Barrack recorded line. In speaking to him, Ivan told me he heard Blake lives near Mt. Zoar Road, Conowingo, Maryland. Blake&amp;#39;s community is just off of that road. I also asked Ivan for clarification being that I saw only two individuals in the video assaulting him. Ivan told me that he heard he was attacked by three people, but was not entirely sure it was actually three attackers. He told me he was certain, however, that Blake and Nathan did in fact assault him. I called him back at approximately 1639 hours to ask follow-up questions. He told me he has viewed the video of him being assaulted. He told me Nathan Reeves is the male in the gray sweatshirt and white ball cap. He said Blake is the male in the black sweatshirt assaulting him (described as possibly a &amp;quot;Champion&amp;quot; sweatshirt). He said he was positive of their identities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also called Evie from the North East Barrack recorded line at approximately 1645 hours on January 15, 2023. She told me she is certain there was a third assailant, but she is unsure who that was. She told me she isn&amp;#39;t sure where the videos originated but she received her copies from Robert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I called Robert at approximately 1650 hours on January 15, 2023, once again on the recorded line. He also said Blake lives off of Mt. Zoar Road. He said he was viewing the video as I spoke to him on the phone. He said he was certain that Nathan Reeves is the individual in the video wearing the gray sweatshirt and white ball cap, and that Blake Greathouse 2nd is the individual in the black (he described it as blue) &amp;quot;Champion&amp;quot; sweatshirt. He wasn&amp;#39;t able to verify whether there really was a third attacker or not. Robert also said he received his copies of the videos from another individual at the party. However, he is not entirely sure where the videos originated from, and said they seemed to have circulated among those attending the party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Based on my application for charges, an arrest warrant was issued for Nathan Reeves on January 16, 2023. I called Reeves and requested he visit the North East Barrack. He did so, and I placed him under arrest pursuant to the arrest warrant at approximately 2006 hours. I transported Nathan Reeves to the Cecil County Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office, where he was released on personal recognizance following his initial appearance. Nathan was charged by the Cecil County Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office (via my application for charges) with Assault - First Degree, Assault - Second Degree, and Reckless Endangerment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; When I arrested Nathan, I read him his Miranda Rights. He advised he understood his rights and did not wish to answer any questions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; During transport, Nathan asked me a question that prompted me to explain the arrest process. I explained the initial appearance process to him and recommended he hire an attorney/request a public defender. I told him an attorney can be helpful even if he intends to plea guilty. When I said this, I was not asking Nathan if he intended to plea guilty or not (I was not asking him anything about the crime he was charged with or the specifics of the crime period). Nathan responded to my statement about how an attorney can be helpful, saying that he planned to plea guilty and admitted to the assault. Again, I was not asking him how he would plea or if he committed the crime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Nathan was advised upon initial contact at the North East Barrack that my body camera was recording and that my vehicle (Marked Car F-4) has a camera system that records audio and video as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Additionally, I noticed the white ball cap Nathan wore when I arrested him is very reminiscent of that which he wore in the video that depicted him fighting Ivan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case remain open for the processing of video evidence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Copies of video footage for this case were uploaded to two CD-RW discs and submitted to the Maryland State Police North East Barrack property room as evidence on January 17, 2023. A copy of the relevant chain of custody logs can be found in &amp;quot;Attachments.&amp;quot; Additionally, photographs of messages sent to me by Nathan Reeves&amp;#39; mother can be found in &amp;quot;Attachments.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;On January 17, 2023, at approximately 1810 hours, I, Trooper First Class Scott (#7217) of the Maryland State Police, received two images depicting text messages. These images were sent by Sandi Reeves, Nathan Reeves&amp;#39; mother. Sandi called the barrack and advised Nathan was receiving messages from Ivan Herrera&amp;#39;s family. I advised Sandi Reeves to apply for a peace order and requested she notify me if anything additional is sent. Sandi&amp;#39;s email appears under the name &amp;quot;Sandi Cheek.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The first image Sandi sent depicts a Facebook message bearing the name &amp;quot;Wendy Herrera.&amp;quot; The message reads &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve done messed with the wrong fucking family!!!&amp;quot;. The second image depicts a Facebook message bearing the name &amp;quot;Jesse Herrera.&amp;quot; This second message reads &amp;quot;Alright bitch what&amp;#39;s good,&amp;quot; followed by the receiver&amp;#39;s response, which reads &amp;quot;? who tf r u[laughing emoji].&amp;quot; The next response on this image (from &amp;quot;Jesse Herrera&amp;quot;) reads &amp;quot;You can fuck around an find that the fuck out, an your two other little bitches can too.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The described messages are quoted with the same grammar in which they are written.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also received an email from Jessica Joines, the homeowner of 87 Bill Goss Loop. Joines advised she has video footage from her home regarding the incident, and photographs of damaged property.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case remain open. Evidence relayed from Joines via email will be added on a supplement to follow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
