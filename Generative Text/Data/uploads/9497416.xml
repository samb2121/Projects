         <NarrativeTitle>Original Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>Scene Processing:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I obtained a photograph of the wallet and contents as it was left at the Greene Turtle restaurant from the bartender identified as Steve Weimer.&amp;nbsp; The picture was uploaded to Verpic. This incident was not audio or video recorded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 2/14/21 at approximately 1120 hours, I (LT. Sigmund) learned that Kevin L. Dowling had left his wallet at the Greene Turtle restaurant.&amp;nbsp; F/Sgt. Williams was previously in contact with Kevin Dowling at the Visitor Center located at 15 Visitors Center Drive, McHenry, MD 21541 (incident# 2023-00066635).&amp;nbsp; Dowling&amp;#39;s vehicle was disabled, he had no money, and was able to contact anyone for assistance.&amp;nbsp; AAA tow service had been called to assist with Dowling&amp;#39;s vehicle.&amp;nbsp; Dowlings behavior and communication with F/Sgt. Williams was agitated and un cooperate throughout his interaction.&amp;nbsp; F/Sgt. Williams learned that Dowling had left his wallet at the Greene Turtle and told him that he left his wallet at the Greene Turtle. Dowling immediately became agitated and defensive stating he left his wallet at Greene Turtle for them to throw it away.&amp;nbsp; Dowling refused to go to the Greene Turtle and retrieve his wallet and again said for them to throw it away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I was on scene at the Visitors Center with F/Sgt. Williams and Kevin Dowling to check if AAA towing service arrived and if he needed any further assistance.&amp;nbsp; Upon arrival, AAA tow service was not on scene and Dowling was in the grassy area of the visitor center.&amp;nbsp; Dowling appeared to be agitated by the presence of F/Sgt. Williams and I. However, we advised him we were just checking if AAA towing service arrived and if he needed anything.&amp;nbsp; Dowling advised that need to charge his cell phone because it is dead and had no power outlet to charge his phone.&amp;nbsp; Dowling requested to call his mom for assistance.&amp;nbsp; I allowed Dowling to use my phone to call his mom (later identified as Michelle Dowling), but received no answer and left a message (requesting help with putting money in his account and telling her where he was location, which I had to correct him on the specific location where he was located).&amp;nbsp; Again, Dowling was agitated because his mom did not answer, and she had not put money in his account.&amp;nbsp; I was able to obtain a battery jump starter pack and assisted Dowling with getting his vehicle started.&amp;nbsp; Dowling then left the Visitor Center and traveled south on RT. 219.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I then responded to the Greene Turtle located at 75 Visitor Center Drive, McHenry, MD 21541 and contacted Steve Michael Weimer (bartender at the Greene Turtle).&amp;nbsp; Weimer stated that on 2/12/23, Dowling came to the Greene Turtle and sat at a table, but only had water (did not order any food).&amp;nbsp; At one point other customers had left their table and Dowling had removed unfinished nachos from their table and ate them.&amp;nbsp; Weimer stated that another customer thought Dowling may be homeless, so they purchased him a burger to eat.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Weimer advised that Dowling returned to the Greene Turtle on 2/13/23 and sat at the bar (only having water to drink).&amp;nbsp; Dowling request to utilized their power outlet to charge his cell phone (which they allowed).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Weimer stated the Greene Turtle closed at 9:00pm, but at 9:30pm Dowling was still inside their bathroom.&amp;nbsp; Weimer had made contact with Dowling advising him they were closed, and he needed to leave.&amp;nbsp; Weimer stated that Dowling had laid his wallet out on the bar and left.&amp;nbsp; Weimer advised he took a photograph of how it was left out and provided me with a copy of the photograph for this case (uploaded to Veripic).&amp;nbsp; I took possession of the Dowling&amp;#39;s wallet described as green and gray colored Power Rangers wallet containing various miscellaneous documents along with a Boston Firefighter Credit Union card #5108 3399 1404 0284 and a Mass Health card # 100226709457 both with the name Kevin L. Dowling.&amp;nbsp; Weimer was unable to provide any further information regarding this incident.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; After speaking to Weimer, I responded to McHenry Barrack and contacted Michelle Dowling (617-680-8534) regarding the contact with Dowling and his wallet that was recovered.&amp;nbsp; Michelle stated that Kevin is her son, and he has had a mental status change approximately six (6) months ago, but he refuses to get help.&amp;nbsp; I advised Michelle about Kevin leaving his wallet and requesting it be thrown away, but it possesses his debit/credit union along with other documents.&amp;nbsp; Michelle stated that is the card that he would use when she puts money in his account.&amp;nbsp; Michelle requested I mail the wallet to her (which is where Kevin resides) rather than destroy it.&amp;nbsp; Michelle was unable to provide any further information at this time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 2/14/23 at approximately 4:07 pm, I mailed (USPS tracking# 9590 9402 7236 1284 1351 29) the wallet and the contents to Michelle Dowling at 2 Edwards Rd, Stoneham, MA 02180.&amp;nbsp; See the attached copy of the receipt and certified mail receipt for further details.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; Case closed non-criminal&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
