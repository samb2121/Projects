Webb gave me four photographs via email of injuries she sustained on 1/09/2023. A Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report was filled out in regard to this case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On 01/11/2023 at approximately 1639 hours, I responded to a report of a domestic disturbance at a Food Lion located at 9936 Stephen Decatur Highway, Ocean City, MD 21842. I arrived on scene at approximately 1644 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Upon my arrival to the Food Lion I contacted the manager of the Food Lion Deborah Lynn Gaske (W/F 5/17/1964). Gaske took me to the back of the store to speak with the victim Evelyn Mary Webb (B/F 6/17/1980). Webb was visibly upset and shaking as I began to speak with her. Webb stated she has been in a relationship with the suspect Craig Tyrone Powell (B/M 8/17/1985) for approximately a year and a half. Webb stated Powell has previously assaulted her 5 times that she can remember which led her to leave him in August of 2022. Webb stated she began a relationship with Powell again in October of 2022. Webb stated since she came back she has been living at the Shaka Pool Bar and Grill located at 12614 Ocean Gateway, Ocean City, MD 21842 with Powell since October of 2022. Webb stated since living with Powell he has controlled her life and would not allow her to leave without his permission. Webb stated Powell would leave a camera constantly recording her. Webb stated Powell threatened to kill her and hurt her on multiple occasions if she left him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Webb stated two days ago she was having enough of the abuse from Powell. Webb stated she told Powell she wanted to leave him. Webb stated Powell grabbed her by the back of her neck and hair and pushed her onto her couch. Webb stated Powell began strangling her with both hands. Webb stated during the strangulation she could not breathe. Webb stated afterwards she was having trouble swallowing and she was having trouble speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Webb stated she attempted to fight back against Powell but she could not resist him. Webb stated Powell stopped strangling her and told Webb to leave her phone in her room and come with him. Webb stated she got in Powell&amp;#39;s car and they drove to an unknown backroad. Webb stated Powell fell asleep in the car and when he woke up Powell stated that Webb was lucky he fell asleep because he would have killed her. Photos of Webb were taken but there were no signs of injury. Webb sent me pictures via email of bruises that were on her neck, face, and the back of her head. Webb stated she took these pictures the day of the incident on January 9, 2023 at approximately 0630 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Webb was picked up by her son-in-law and taken back to Shaka Pool Bar and Grill room 10 to get her belongings. Webb stated Powell lived in room 12. As I walked into the room with Webb I did notice a ring camera facing towards Webb&amp;#39;s bed and her bathroom. The camera was on as I entered the room. Webb gathered her belongings and left the area with her son-in-law. TFC Shubert #7062, TFC Furness #7275, and I searched for Powell but could not locate him. A Maryland State Police Victim/Witness pamphlet was given to Webb. Webb was informed on how to get a protective order with the commissioner&amp;#39;s office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I created a Statement of Probable Cause for this case and was awarded a warrant for Assault First, Assault Second, and False Imprisonment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At approximately 2229 hours multiple troopers from the Berlin barrack and I attempted a warrant service for Powell. Powell could not be located.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I request this case remain open pending warrant service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Worcester County, MD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp;Interview captured on Axon body camera&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Narrative&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On February 6, 2023, at approximately 1630 hours Worcester County Deputies took Powell into custody and transported him to the Worcester County Detention Center.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On February 8, 2023, at approximately 1702 hours, I, Trooper Messick, went to the Worcester County Detention Center to interview Powell regarding this case. Upon contact with Powell I read him his Miranda Rights which he waived at approximately 1738 hours.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Powell stated on the day of the incident at Food Lion, he was with Webb at Shaka Pool Bar and Grill working. Powell stated Webb wanted to see her eldest son that day. Powell stated Webb didn&amp;#39;t drive, and he was the only one that would drive her to visits with her son. Powell stated he would be busy with work, so he asked her if she could wait until the weekend. Powell stated she agreed to this idea, and they went about their day. Powell stated he asked Webb if she needed any groceries for dinner that night and Webb stated she needed to go to the grocery store. Powell took Webb to Food Lion and dropped her off. Powell stated he got a call from his friend to come back to Shaka Pool Bar and Grill. Powell stated this was the point where TFC Shubert and TFC Furness pulled him over, and he was questioned by them. Powell stated that TFC Shubert and TFC Furness told him he couldn&amp;#39;t drive as his license was suspended, so he decided to walk back home to Shaka Bar and Grill. Powell stated he felt as though he would be in trouble if he stayed around his residence, so he found a way to get out of the area to be able to get his affairs in order before his inevitable arrest. Powell stated he turned himself in with the Worcester County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Department on the day of his arrest.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Powell stated he knew nothing about the bruising that was on Webb from approximately two days prior to the incident. Powell also stated he did not take Webb on a back road and threaten to kill her. When asked about the camera in room 10 of the Shaka Bar and Grill, Powell stated the cameras were to protect his belongings. Powell stated there were instances where his belongings would go missing, and he heard there was $16,000 missing from the Shaka Bar and Grill itself. Powell stated he has a medical marijuana card and had his marijuana in an air fryer&amp;nbsp; on the refrigerator which was his main concern with the camera.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Powell stated multiple times he believes Webb made up the story and was coached by her older son. Powell stated the only reasons Webb would make up a story is because he told her to wait till the weekend to be able to see her son, and he had confronted her about the missing things in his room. Powell stated he was not forceful with the confrontation about the missing things and when Webb said she had nothing to do with it, he believed her. Powell stated Webb and him have never had any physical altercation in the time they have been together. Powell stated there was no argument physical or verbal the day of the incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case be closed per arrest of Powell.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;Attachments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One (1) MCAC LPR data printout&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Narrative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On April 27th at approximately 1200 hours I received an email from State&amp;#39;s Attorney Pamela Correa regarding this case. Correa requested that I attempt to get any nearby camera footage of Shaka and the surrounding area as well as any LPR data that I could possibly find. This was in regard to the night of the assault where Webb stated she was taken to a separate location where she was threatened by Powell. Correa stated she would like me to get in contact with the FBI cast team to do a trace of Webb and Powell&amp;#39;s cell phones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I informed D/Sgt Johnson #1773 about Correa&amp;#39;s requests. D/Sgt Johnson contacted CED to handle much of the investigation regarding cell phone tracing and I made contact with MCAC to hopefully get LPR data from the area. There were two hits from the LPR on the US 50 bridge into Ocean City.&amp;nbsp; The first one was taken at 2028 hours on&amp;nbsp;January 8, 2023, in the westbound right lane of the US 50 bridge and the second was taken heading eastbound on the US 50 bridge into Ocean City at 2111 hours on January 8, 2023. The document sent by MCAC is attached to this report and sent to Correa. I was unable to get any camera footage at the Shaka bar and Grill or local businesses in the area to assist in the case.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On May 4, 2023, at approximately 1411 hours I received an email from Correa regarding this case. Correa stated she listened to a phone call from Powell in the Worcester County Detention Center where Powell stated something happened on the day of the incident but it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as Webb described.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Worcester County, MD.</NarrativeText>
