         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On Saturday, March 4, 2023, at 1920 hours, I, M/T Eric Schramm #2841, received a telephone call from D/Sgt. Jeremy Vogt of the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit in reference to an Officer Involved Shooting. I was advised that an Officer Involved Shooting had occurred at 1599 N. East Street Apartment 17 Frederick, Maryland 21701. &amp;nbsp;I was advised to respond to the scene and assume the primary investigative role for MSP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Upon arrival on the scene, I met with investigators from the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit and the Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office IID Unit. I learned that Frederick City Police received a call for an attempt to locate Joseph Scott Sherrill (W/M 06/24/1978), who had an open VOP warrant for his arrest. The call for the attempt to locate came from Harford County after they received information that Sherrill was staying at the above address. Officers responded to the address and knocked on the door. The door was answered by a female, Cher Sherill. Sherill allowed officers inside to look for Sherrill after a several minute conversation at the door. Officers located Sherrill hiding inside a bedroom closet. Once confronted, he opened and brandished a folding knife while making a statement that suggested that officers would have to shoot him. The officers began to back away from Sherrill and retreated to the living room area of the residence. Sherrill was given verbal orders to drop the knife as he appeared in the doorway of the bedroom and into the hallway. Sherrill ignored those orders and charged at the officers with the knife in hand. Two Frederick City Police Officers, identified as Hess and Mirza, discharged their agency-issued firearms, striking Sherrill. I was advised that Joseph Sherill was pronounced deceased by Lt. Miller (medic 29) of the Frederick City Fire and EMS at 1909 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was advised that body-worn cameras were utilized by the Frederick City Police Officers. That footage had been reviewed by members of the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit and investigators for the Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office and confirmed the serious of events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Investigators from the Attorney Generals Office IID Unit responded to the Frederick City Police Headquarters and completed round counts of the involved officers with the assistance of Crime Scene Technician J. Jeudy. As a result of the round counts it was determined that 9 shots were fired during the incident. Officer Mirza&amp;rsquo;s service weapon is a Glock model 17, serial number HZL900. This weapon contained 11 live rounds, and he also had two magazines with 15 live rounds each. Officer Hess&amp;rsquo;s service weapon is a Glock model 17, serial number HZL841. This weapon contained 12 live rounds, and he also had two magazines with 15 live rounds each. All ammunition was Speer brand 9mm luger plus P, consistent with Frederick City Police issue. The service weapons and extra magazines of Officer Hess and Officer Mirza were collected as evidence by CST Jeudy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A search warrant for the apartment was authored by Sgt. Steven Muehl of the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit. The search warrant was reviewed and signed (March 4, 2023, @ 11:11 P.M.) by The Honorable Judge Martz-Fisher of the Circuit Court of Maryland for Frederick County. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Maryland State Police Forensic Investigators, CST J. Jeudy, and CST S. Woods completed the processing of the scene at 1599 N. East Street Apartment 17 Frederick, Maryland 21701. Processing of the scene included detailing the scene through photographs and detailed measurements.&amp;nbsp; Evidence collected during the warrant included one folding knife located in an open position near Sherill, nine spent 9mm shell casings, and three recovered projectiles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Forensic Investigator Brian Shriner arrived on the scene at approximately 1241 hours and completed an assessment of Sherill. FI Shriner made contact with the Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) in Baltimore and arranged an autopsy of Sherill. The OCME case number assigned to the autopsy of Sherill is 23-02960. Sherill was transported from the scene to the OCME by Meek Mortuary Service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The search warrant inventory and return were completed and forwarded to Judge Martz-Fisher by Sgt. Muehl. The completed inventory and return have been uploaded to the shared drive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The autopsy of Joseph Sherill was completed on March 5, 2023. It was attended by M/T Chad Warner of the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit and Crime Scene Technician J. Jeudy. M/T Warner completed a supplemental report documenting the autopsy findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was provided access to the body-worn camera footage of the involved and witnessing officers for review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I first completed a review of the body-worn camera footage of Officer Coady. Officer Coady arrived on the scene of the attempt to locate at 18:40:03 (time of camera activation) hours according to his body worn camera footage. Officer Coady is with Officer Mirza at this time in the stairwell outside doors marked 16 and 17. As Officer Mirza and Coady approach the doors, the door to apartment 16 opens and approximately 7 people begin to exit the apartment. These people appear to speak to Coady, but the audio is not yet activated on his camera. The audio starts on his camera at 18:41:04. The door to apartment 17 opens at 18:41:25 and a white female, later identified as Cher Sherill, begins communicating with officers through a crack in the door. Cher and Coady begin a conversation about the whereabouts of Joseph Sherill.&amp;nbsp; Cher states over and over that Sherill is not in the apartment. She attempts to convince Coady that Sherill is staying with a girl at the Hampton Inn. Coady informs Cher that if she is lying to them, and they find out that Sherill is inside then she can be arrested. At 18:45:42, Cher shuts the door to apartment 17, leaving the officers outside. At 18:45:50 the door to apartment 17 is opened again by Cher. Cher opens the doorway wide and grabs her dog and pulls the dog by the collar from the doorway. Cher begins walking into the apartment and officers follow.&amp;nbsp; Officer Coady enters the apartment first and yells, &amp;quot;Joseph, if you&amp;#39;re here let us know now&amp;rdquo;. Coady moves down the hallway to the left as he enters the apartment. Officer Coady first checks a bedroom directly at the end of the hallway containing children&amp;#39;s style beds. Coady then begins to check what appears to be the master bedroom. Coady locates Joseph Sherill hiding in the closet of this bedroom at 18:46:37. Sherill is crouched in the corner of this closet. Coady immediately orders Sherill to show his hands. Sherill is holding an object in his left hand at this time and Officer Coady orders him to &amp;ldquo;drop the knife&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; Sherill then begins to move, states &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; and begins to unfold the knife.&amp;nbsp; Officer Coady begins to back out of the bedroom while Sherill stands up and comes out of the closet.&amp;nbsp; Coady again orders Sherill to drop the knife, and Sherill responded by saying &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re going to have to shoot me&amp;rdquo;. Coady is exiting the bedroom at this time and Cher is just inside the bedroom with Sherill. Coady grabs Cher by her hooded sweatshirt and pulls her from the bedroom as she resists. Coady radioed for additional units and then pulls Cher to the living room/front door area of the apartment. At 18:47:01 Mirza and Hess begin giving verbal commands for Sherill to drop the knife as Coady is dealing with Cher. Coady gives an update over the radio that he is in the apartment armed with a knife. At 18:47:15 Coady&amp;rsquo;s body-worn camera captures Sherill at the end of the hallway near the opening of the living room with a knife in his left hand and the blade exposed. At this time Sherill can be seen starting to move in a quick manner toward Officer Mirza who is in the living room. At 18:47:16 as officers are still giving verbal commands to drop the knife and Sherill is moving towards Officer Mirza the first shot can be heard on camera. At 18:47:18 the final shot is heard on the video. AT 18:47:30 seconds a radio call of shots fired is heard on the video. &amp;nbsp;At 18:47:33 Officer Coady approaches Sherill who is laying face down on the living room floor. At this time a knife with the blade exposed can be seen lying against the wall near the entrance to a room with pictures taped to the door and walls. The knife is laying with a couple of feet of Sherill. A radio call to start EMS can be heard on the video also at this time. Officer Coady immediately begins to assess the injuries of Sherill and instructs other officers to get gloves on. Officer Coady exits the apartment, runs to his patrol car, retrieves a medical kit, and requests that they start aviation. Officer Coady begins to place a chest seal on a wound on Sherill&amp;rsquo;s right side. Coady begins CPR at 18:50:09. EMS arrived at 18:52:25, and Coady continued CPR during their assessment until he is relieved at 18:53:12. Coady remained in the apartment until he was relieved by Cpl. Carpenter at 19:03:22. Coady&amp;rsquo;s body-worn camera footage is discontinued as he exits the apartment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I then completed a review of the body-worn camera of Officer Mirza. Mirza&amp;rsquo;s camera footage begins at 18:37:51 while they are still en route to the scene. &amp;nbsp;The audio portion of Mirza&amp;rsquo;s footage begins at 18:38:51 as he is walking towards the apartment. Officer Mirza knocks on the door of apartment 17 at 18:40:45. Officer Coady can be seen on the footage having the same conversation documented above with Cher Sherill. Officer Mirza follows Coady into the apartment at 18:46:00. Officer Mirza enters the apartment and goes right, into the living room and into a room with pictures taped to the door and wall that contains tattoo equipment and aquariums. Mirza exits that room and begins to search the living room area. &amp;nbsp;Mirza opens a sliding door to the outside when Officer Coady can be heard in the background ordering someone to show their hands. Officer Mirza turns his attention to the area down the hallway where Officer Hess can be seen. Officer Coady is backing his way out of the bedroom and pulls Cher out with him. Sherill can be heard at that time saying &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to have to shoot me&amp;rdquo;. Mirza backs up into the living room and is looking down the hallway. At 18:47:00, Sherill appears in the doorway of the bedroom and begins to drink something. He then places the drink on the ground and walks down the hallway toward Mirza. At this time Officers Hess and Coady are seen near the front door of the apartment with Cher. As Sherill reaches the end of the hallway and into the clearing of the living room a knife is seen with the blade exposed in his left hand. Sherill is being given verbal commands to drop the knife and received no less than a dozen commands to do so prior to charging in the direction of Officer Mirza with the knife still in his left hand. Officer Mirza begins firing his weapon at 18:47:16 at Sherill as Sherill is coming directly towards him. Sherill is within approximately 8 to 10 feet of Mirza and advancing toward him when the shots are fired. Mirza fires multiple shots at Sherill before Sherill collapses on the living room floor, face down. Officer Coady can be seen approaching Sherill and checking him for injuries. Officer Hess is seen continuing care for Sherill as Coady leaves to retrieve a medical bag. Officer Mirza leaves the apartment at 18:48:37, after saying something about getting gloves to Cpl. Carpenter. As Mirza is exiting, he is met on the steps by Officer Coady who is returning with the medical bag. Coady instructs Mirza to go wait in the car. Officer Mirza returns to the patrol car as instructed. He muted his camera at 18:49:30. His camera&amp;#39;s audio is activated again at 18:51:40. He then begins to follow arriving EMS into the apartment building. He enters the apartment again at 18:52:23. Cpl. Carpenter appears to send Officer Hess and Officer Mirza out of the apartment at 18:53:15 after EMS arrived and assumed care of Sherill. Officer Mirza exits the building with Officer Hess and Dodson and his camera turns off at 18:54:23.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I then reviewed the body-worn camera footage of Officer Hess. Officer Hess activated his camera at 18:40:29 as he is walking across the parking lot of the apartment complex. Officer Hess&amp;rsquo;s camera audio begins at 18:41:29 as he approached Officers Mirza and Coady outside apartment 17. Officer Hess&amp;rsquo;s camera captures the several minute conversation between Cher and Coady as previously described.&amp;nbsp; Officer Hess enters the apartment behind Coady and Mirza at 18:46:01. Officer Hess moves to the right as he enters the apartment, across the living room, and into a room with pictures taped to the door and wall. After checking that room, he exits and is in the living room area when Officer Coady can be heard instructing someone to show their hands. Officer Hess immediately begins to head in the direction of Coady down the hallway. Hess&amp;rsquo;s camera captures Coady backing out of the bedroom while instructing Sherill to drop the knife. The statement Sherill made &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re going to have to shoot me&amp;rdquo; can be heard on Hess&amp;rsquo;s footage also. Coady can be seen pulling Cher out of the bedroom and back down the hallway. Sherill comes back into Hess&amp;rsquo;s camera view at 18:47:13. Sherill can be seen holding the knife in his left hand. Audio of the Officers telling Sherill to drop the knife multiple times is also heard on Hess&amp;rsquo;s footage. At 18:47:14, Sherill is seen in the footage with his eyes focused in the direction of where Officer Mirza is standing, and the knife raised in his left hand. Sherill begins to move quickly towards Officer Mirza&amp;rsquo;s location when Officer Hess begins to fire at Sherill at 18:47:15. Hess&amp;rsquo;s video also shows the close proximity that Sherill was to Mirza when he was shot.&amp;nbsp; Officer Hess holds cover on Sherill until Coady checked to ensure the knife was clear. Hess then put a pair of gloves on and began to access the injuries and render aid to Sherill. Officer Hess continued to assist Coady with the care of Sherill until the arrival of EMS. Officer Hess s instructed by Cpl. Carpenter to exit the apartment at 18:53:06. Officer Hess turns off the audio to his footage at that time. Officer Hess exits the apartment and ends his recording at 18:53:15.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Frederick City Police also provided body-worn camera footage for Cpl. Carpenter. Cpl Carpenter was not on scene during the shooting incident but arrived soon after. Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s footage begins at 18:46:42 as he is still in his patrol vehicle outside the apartment building. Carpenter enters the apartment at 18:47:30 after Sherill had been shot. The audio begins on his footage at 18:47:43. His footage shows Officer Coady and Officer Hess clearing the area around Sherill and begin aid to him. Cpl. Carpenter leaves his body-worn camera run for a total of 1 hour and 11 minutes. Most of the time the camera is capturing visual only as the audio stops recording after the first 7 minutes and 36 seconds. During the remainder of the video Cpl. Carpenter is in and out of the apartment. Cpl. Carpenter exits the apartment and walks down the staircase when his recording stops at 19:58:10.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Cpl. Carpenter submitted to a recorded interview about the incident on March 16, 2023. Myself and IID Investigator Davis met with Cpl. Carpenter and his attorney Nick Paradise on that date at the Frederick City FOP Lodge located at 5 Hillcrest Drive Frederick, MD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; During this interview, Cpl. Carpenter detailed that he arrived on the scene after the shooting had occurred. Carpenter was in the building on the stairwell when he heard the gunshot. Upon his arrival inside the apartment, Sherill was on the living room floor and Officer Coady was starting to provide aid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This interview was recorded using a DVR and has been uploaded to the shared drive. A detailed narrative of this interview has been completed by IID Investigator Davis and is located in the shared drive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; CST Jeudy has provided me with copies of the MSP form 67&amp;rsquo;s that were completed for the round counts, scene processing, and the autopsy of Sherill. Those MSP form 67&amp;rsquo;s have been uploaded to the shared drive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A copy of the Crime Lab Report from the swab collected of the knife recovered has also been provided to me by CST Jeudy. That has also been uploaded to the shared drive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Other members of the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit to include, D/Sgt Vogt, Sgt. Martin, Cpl. Ward, and M/T Warner, have completed supplemental reports to document their involvement in this investigation. Those supplemental reports have been included on the shared drive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No additional investigative efforts were required at this time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
