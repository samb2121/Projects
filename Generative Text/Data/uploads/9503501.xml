         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On March 5, 2023, at approximately 2054 hours, I was dispatched to a single vehicle crash on Eastbound Interstate 68 at Orleans Road, Allegany County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp; The assigned Maryland State Police case number is 23MSP008240, which is assigned by the Maryland State Police.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to my arrival, the barrack advised that the crash involved a single vehicle, that was overturned on its roof and EMS and fire were being dispatched to the scene.&amp;nbsp; The operator of the vehicle was unconscious and not responsive to the bystanders on the scene and still trapped in the vehicle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Fire and EMS arrived on the scene, the operator was still unconscious and in the driver&amp;#39;s seat of the vehicle trapped upside down.&amp;nbsp; Fire and EMS were able to remove the operator from the vehicle and transfer him onto a backboard and placed in the rear of an ambulance on the scene.&amp;nbsp; Trooper 5, medevac, was contacted by EMS personnel on the scene prior to my arrival, due to the extent of the operator&amp;#39;s injuries and his lack of consciousness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon my arrival, I observed a 2004 white Mercury Grand Marquis, bearing Virginia registration, UZJ9897, on its roof in the median between the on ramp from Orleans Road and Eastbound Interstate 68.&amp;nbsp; EMS personnel advised that the operator was in the back of the ambulance.&amp;nbsp; I then went to the back of the ambulance to check the status of the operator.&amp;nbsp; Once in the back of the ambulance, I observed him to be awake and able to answer questions that the paramedic was asking him.&amp;nbsp; I located his license in his wallet that was inside the pants that EMS removed from him in the back of the ambulance.&amp;nbsp; I was able to identify the operator as, William Paul Linton III, by his Virginia license.&amp;nbsp; The Virginia driver&amp;#39;s license provided a facial photograph that also positively identified the operator as William Paul Linton III.&amp;nbsp; William Paul Linton&amp;rsquo;s III date of birth is June 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1991.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the EMS personnel were completed with Linton III, I was able to ask him basic questions, and he was able to provide answers to me.&amp;nbsp; During my questioning, Linton III confirmed that he was the sole occupant and operator of the 2004 white Mercury, but was unsure why he was in the back of an ambulance.&amp;nbsp; I advised him that he had been involved in a motor vehicle collision, and that he was being treated for his injuries.&amp;nbsp; I asked Linton III, what had occurred prior to the collision that caused him to run off the roadway, and he was unsure what had occurred.&amp;nbsp; Linton III then advised me that he had been drinking prior to the crash.&amp;nbsp; I asked him what he was drinking, and he advised bourbon and vodka.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once your I spoke with Linton III, I then went to the vehicle and inside the vehicle was a Southern Comfort whiskey liqueur bottle, that was half-empty and a 2-liter of Coke that was also opened.&amp;nbsp; Linton III was then transported from the ambulance into Trooper 5, and flown to Conemaugh Valley Memorial Hospital in Johnstown, Pennsylvania for his injuries.&amp;nbsp; Due to Linton&amp;#39;s III injuries and being treated by medical personnel, field sobriety tests were unable to be performed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Trooper Morris, from the Pennsylvania State Police, applied for a search warrant, and it was issued to obtain the medical records on Linton III for the treatment he received at Conemaugh Hospital.&amp;nbsp; The blood records revealed on page 146 that his blood alcohol level was a .32, which is four times the legal limit.&amp;nbsp; The records also advised on page 113 that they had to get his mother&amp;#39;s verbal and written consent due to Linton III being too intoxicated to provide consent for himself.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Based on this hospital records, I made contact with Linton III via telephone, and he agreed to come to the barrack on 3/31/23 to be issued the proper paperwork for the DUI.&amp;nbsp; Linton III arrived at the Cumberland Barrack at approximately 1400 hours and was cooperative and provided me with his Virginia license.&amp;nbsp; At this point I issued Linton III a DR 15, DR-15A, and five citations, 5KH0B2Y, 5KJ0B2Y, 5KK0B2Y, 5KL0B2Y, 5KM0B2Y, for the crash and DUI. The citations were issued on 3/31/23 with that date listed as the violation date.&amp;nbsp; I failed to change the date due to an oversight at the time that I issued them, due to this not being a normal daily activity.&amp;nbsp; Linton III then left the barrack with his mother after he was issued the paperwork.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
