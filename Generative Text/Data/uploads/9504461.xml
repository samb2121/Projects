O&amp;#39;Donald, a black Chevrolet SUV traveling in lane 2, the lane closest to the right shoulder we were on, passed myself, Tpr. O&amp;#39;Donald and TFC Brader who were out of their vehicle on the traffic stop, and the two cars that had pulled over for the traffic stop.&amp;nbsp; All 4 vehicles on the shoulder had lights on, including two sets of police vehicle lights, and should have been easily visible to drivers approaching due to the well lit area.&amp;nbsp; The Chevrolet bearing Maryland registration 2ET5378, passed us at what appeared to be a high rate of speed, and did not put on their brakes or move over to the empty left-hand lane available.&amp;nbsp; I pulled away from the traffic stop and caught up to the Chevrolet.&amp;nbsp; Once behind the Chevrolet, I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop.&amp;nbsp; The Chevrolet was slow to pull over, I activated my emergency lights at Eastbound Route 50 and Golf Course Road.&amp;nbsp; The Chevrolet did not begin to slow and pull to the right until we were passing the Park and Ride entrance near the laundromat, however did not stop driving and continued past both Park and Ride Entrances, through the Inlet Isle intersection, and came to a stop on the right shoulder Eastbound Route 50 and Inlet Isle, at the base of the Harry Kelly Bridge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHASE 2 : PERSONAL CONTACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I approached the vehicle on the driver side.&amp;nbsp; I made contact with the driver at the open driver window.&amp;nbsp; I immediately detected a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle and that the driver was smiling, and had bloodshot, glassy eyes.&amp;nbsp; I introduced myself, advised the driver and passenger that they were being audibly and visually recorded, and advised my reason for the stop.&amp;nbsp; When I asked if the driver was familiar with the move over law, he advised that he was aware of the move over law and explained it to me.&amp;nbsp; I then asked the driver if he had his license and registration with him. The driver went to reach for the glove box, and then stopped, and advised that he did not have license or registration.&amp;nbsp; I asked where they were coming from tonight, and the driver advised &amp;quot;Frederick.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; I was able to identify the driver by name and date of birth as Daniel Lawrence Tanner (W/M, DOB 01/19/1979, MD SDX&amp;nbsp;T 560 135 488 052 - suspended).&amp;nbsp; While tanner was providing his information, he had difficulty recalling his birthday, as well as difficulty spelling his middle name.&amp;nbsp; I asked Tanner how many alcoholic beverages he had consumed that night, and he advised none, and that they were heading to Ocean City.&amp;nbsp; I also asked Tanner if his license was valid, and he advised yes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHASE 3 : PRE - ARREST SCREENING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I re-approached the Chevrolet once additional units arrived on scene for back up.&amp;nbsp; I advised Tanner that I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage, and wanted him to submit to Standardized Field Sobriety Tests to ensure he was safe to be operating a motor vehicle.&amp;nbsp; Tanner agreed to submit to SFSTs.&amp;nbsp; Prior to any testing, I first asked Tanner the following questions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Medical Conditions: Right foot, ankle, tibia and fibula broken.&amp;nbsp; This happened over six months ago, and Tanner advised it was healing, and that he is currently under the care of a Doctor for his leg/foot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Medications: Lexapro and Albutropin.&amp;nbsp; Tanner advised these are for anxiety and depression, and that they do not affect his driving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Physical Disabilities: See above right leg/foot issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Glasses or Contacts: Advised no due to having Lasik surgery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Surface condition for the tests was the right shoulder at the location of the stop in front of the vehicle Tanner had been driving.&amp;nbsp; The surface was dry, appeared to be flat, and free of debris.&amp;nbsp; The area was well lit by road lights, the Chevrolet&amp;#39;s headlights, as well as trooper flashlights.&amp;nbsp; Tanner had stepped out of his vehicle without shoes on, and I had asked him if he wanted shoes for the tests.&amp;nbsp; Tanner advised he was not sure where his shoes were located in the car, and did not think he needed them for the tests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Prior to Tanner submitting to the HGN test, I first properly explained what the test would entail.&amp;nbsp; I instructed Tanner to lean against the hood of the vehicle, and increase the distance between his feet, so as t bring us to a more equal height.&amp;nbsp; I then instructed Tanner to look at the tip of my pen, being held approximately 12-15 inches away from his face and slightly above eye level.&amp;nbsp; I instructed Tanner to follow the tip of the pen with his eyes and his eyes only, keeping his head straight forward and in a neutral position.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Tanner had no resting nystagmus, equal pupil size, and equal tracking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lack of Smooth Pursuit: Present in Both Eyes&lt;br /&gt; Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus: Present in Both Eyes&lt;br /&gt; Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 Degrees: Present in Both Eyes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Vertical Nystagmus: Present in Both Eyes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALK AND TURN (5/8 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Prior to Tanner submitting to the WAT test, I first properly explained and demonstrated how the WAT should be completed.&amp;nbsp; I instructed and demonstrated for Tanner to place his left foot on an imaginary straight line in front of him, and to place his right foot directly in front of his left, touching heel to toe.&amp;nbsp; I advised Tanner to remain in this position with his hands flat by his sides while I finished explaining and demonstrating the test.&amp;nbsp; I instructed and demonstrated for Tanner to take nine (9) heel touching toe steps forward on his imaginary straight line.&amp;nbsp; Once he reached his ninth and final step, I instructed and demonstrated for Tanner to complete a turn, leaving his lead foot planted and using a series of small steps with his trail foot prior to taking nine heel touching toe step back on the imaginary straight line in the same way he had been told and shown the first nine steps.&amp;nbsp; I reiterated all of the instructions, and advised Tanner to look where he was walking, count out loud each step, keep his hands by his sides, take nine heel touching toe steps on an imaginary straight line, conduct the turn as informed, and take nine heel touching toe steps back, and that once he started the test not to stop until he had completed the test as explained and demonstrated.&amp;nbsp; I asked Tanner if he understood and he advised that he did. Tanner also reiterated the instructions while attempting to remain in the starting position, during this he was swaying and bent over forward at the waist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructional Phase:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. Cannot maintain starting position.&amp;nbsp; Tanner stepped out of the starting position during instructions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking Phase:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2.

Step 7 and 8 on the first series of nine steps missed heel touching toe&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 4.&amp;nbsp; Incorrect turn.&amp;nbsp; Almost fell over on the turn and had stumbling steps, moving both feet off the line.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 5.&amp;nbsp; Stepped off-line on steps 4 and 9 of the second series of nine steps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE LEG STAND&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Prior to Tanner submitting to the OLS test, I first properly explained and demonstrated what the OLS would entail.&amp;nbsp; I instructed Tanner that he would raise the foot of his choosing approximately 6 inches off the ground and parallel to the ground, keeping his hands by his sides and his legs straight.&amp;nbsp; I instructed Tanner to look down at his foot and count out loud by one thousands (one thousand one, one thousand two, etc) until instructed by me to stop.&amp;nbsp; Tanner advised he understood these instructions.&amp;nbsp; Tanner raised his left foot for the test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. Put foot down 4 times during seconds 2-10 of the test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. Used arms for balance throughout the test by raising them away from his body by more than six inches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3.&amp;nbsp; Swayed throughout the test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 4.&amp;nbsp; Hopped and eventually put his foot down and concluded the test at 17 seconds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALPHABET TEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Prior to Tanner submitting to the Alphabet test, I first asked his highest level of education.&amp;nbsp; Tanner advised he has two college degrees.&amp;nbsp; I asked Tanner if he was comfortable with his English alphabet, and he advised he was.&amp;nbsp; I asked Tanner to recite his English alphabet in order beginning with the letter F and ending with the letter T. Tanner recited the following:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FGKQ, ABCDFG, FGQHILRST.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUMERICS TEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Prior to Tanner submitting to the numeric test, I asked if he was comfortable with his numbers 1-100, and he advised he was.&amp;nbsp; I asked Tanner to count backwards from 56-37.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Tanner counted correctly form 56-51, paused, counted correctly to 46, paused, Tanner was confused on 43 and 42, Tanner then counted correctly from 39-37.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST: Offered and Refused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARREST AND TRANSPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At 2320 hours, Tanner was placed under arrest for DUI as well as for confirmation of a Failure to Appear warrant from Frederick County MSP.&amp;nbsp; A search incident to arrest was conducted and no weapons or contraband were found on Tanner.&amp;nbsp; Tanner was played his DR-15 in the vehicle, however due to Tanner being intoxicated as well as his passenger being intoxicated, Tanner was unable to pay attention to the form.&amp;nbsp; I transported Tanner to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack with out incident.&amp;nbsp; At the barrack, a secondary search was conducted also with negative results.&amp;nbsp; Tanner was re-read his DR-15 and advised he did not want to submit to the intoximeter test, refusal time of 2358 hours.&amp;nbsp; Tanner was placed in a cell while I completed his paperwork for the DUI and warrant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAPERWORK AND TRANSPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Tanner was given and explained all copies of his paperwork including the following traffic citations:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TA 21 902 a1i - DUI&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; TA 21 902 b1i - DWI&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; TA 21 901.1 b - Negligent Driving&lt;br /&gt; TA 21 901.1 a - Reckless Driving&lt;br /&gt; TA 13 409 b - Fail to Display Registration&lt;br /&gt; TA 16 112 c - Fail to Display License&lt;br /&gt; TA 16 303 c - Driving on Suspended License&lt;br /&gt; TA&amp;nbsp; 21 405 e2l - Fail to Not Make Available Lane Change to Lane Not Immediately Adjacent to Stopped Vehicle (move over law)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Tanner was seen by the Commissioner via telephone at the barrack for his initial appearance hearing.&amp;nbsp; Tanner was held on $5,000 bond.&amp;nbsp; I transported Tanner to the Worcester County Detention Center located in Snow Hill without incident.&amp;nbsp; During this transport, Tanner admitted to consuming alcohol and advised he had been drinking Vodka.&amp;nbsp; Tanner was talkative during transport.&amp;nbsp; Tanner was transferred to the custody of the jail without incident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Due to the facts above, I request this case be closed by arrest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
