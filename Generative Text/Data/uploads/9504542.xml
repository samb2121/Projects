         <NarrativeText>SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Several photographs were taken of both the suspect and victim on scene. A Written Statement (MSP 076) was obtained from the victim, and a Petition for Emergency Evaluation was completed on behalf of the suspect while on scene.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;One Petition for Emergency Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;One Written Statement (MSP 076)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Eight photographs were taken and digitally uploaded to this report&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ATTACHMENTS/DOCUMENTS: &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;One Petition for Emergency Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;One Written Statement (MSP 076)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Eight photographs were taken and digitally uploaded to this report&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;*This incident was captured on BWC by TFC Kaszubski #6859 and Tpr Tenney #7378*&lt;br /&gt; *This incident is domestic related and did not occur within sight or sound of children over the age of 2 years.*&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;On Friday, June 17, 2023, at approximately 2040 hours, I responded to University of Maryland&amp;#39;s Baltimore-Washington Medical Center (BWMC) located at 200 Hospital Drive, Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel, MD 21061 to assist Trooper Tenney #7378.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon arrival, I was approached by a black, female in red sweatpants and a black t-shirt, with bleach blonde curly hair, cut very shirt, and appeared in her early 20&amp;#39;s. The female subject began knocking on the closed driver side window to gather my attention. I was unable to open my door due to where she stood between mine and Tpr Tenney&amp;#39;s patrol vehicle, so I placed the window down to speak with her. The female subject began frantically and rapidly speaking about &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot; bringing her to the hospital, and she didn&amp;#39;t understand why, and advised she was being chased. I began asking the female subject to move, so that I could exit the vehicle to speak with her further. The female subject then, yelled, &amp;quot;him that&amp;#39;s my dad, he brought me here,&amp;quot; and pointed toward the far side of Tpr Tenny&amp;#39;s patrol vehicle. I observed a black male, mid-40&amp;#39;s with braids standing with his palms up. The male identified himself as the father of the female subject, and advised he was bringing her to the hospital to inquire about an emergency petition, that she was experiencing some mental health issues. As the male subject approached the vehicle slowly, the female subject jumped towards him, and struck him several times across the head with a closed right-handed fist. At that time, I requested additional police assistance. The subject began screaming, &amp;quot;help me,&amp;quot; and then, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m okay,&amp;quot; repeatedly. The male subject grabbed the female subject from behind in a cross-arm control hold around her upper torso area, and fell to the ground. The female subject began kicking and striking the male with both fists, as they moved away from my door, I was able to exit the vehicle. The male subject then sat straddled over the female subjects hips, while she laid on her side. I subsequently, told the female subject to place her hands behind her back, and she was handcuffed to the rear. The female subject was compliant with my request. During the incident, several cars passing on the thru-road of the hospital slowed down, to watch Jala. One vehicle, slammed on it&amp;#39;s brakes, causing a screeching sound as it approached an intersection.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I placed the female subject into a recovery position, and sitting her up-right. The female subject identified herself as, Jala N Boardly-Ray (B/F DOB: 11/22/2002). Jala did not possess an Identification card. The father was identified by his Maryland Driver&amp;#39;s License as, Julian Dante Ray (B/M DOB: 7/2/1983). Jala advised, she did not require any medical attention at that moment. Tpr Tenney responded to the Emergency Room Exit/Entrance, where I was located, to assist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Jala and Julian were separated for further question.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Julian advised, Jala was brought to his residence earlier in the week by her grandmother from Delaware, where she resides full-time. Julian advised, Jala had not lived with him for a few years time, and only occasionally visits. Julian advised, due to a history of behavioral issues with Jala, she was not welcomed to stay at residence now that she was an adult. Julian advised, earlier in the afternoon, he observed Jala walking outside the neighborhood with a stranger - an older man, whom he was not familiar with in the area. Julian advised, Jala has a history of trying to solicit sexual intercourse from strangers, for an unknown reason.&amp;nbsp;Julian advised, he and Jala returned to the residence for the evening, and sometime after, Jala walked out of the apartment without telling him where she was going. Julian advised, a verbal argument occurred, and Jala made suicidal statements, wishing to die. Julian advised, he approached Jala, and told her to get in the vehicle, that he was taking her back home to her grandmother. Julian advised, Jala was upset by this incident, and began hitting him, once in the vehicle. At that time, Julian responded to the hospital where this incident subsequently occurred. While speaking with Julian, I observed no obvious signs of injury, nor did he complain of any injury or require medical assistance. Julian advised, Jala has a history of Emergency Petitions and behavioral and mental health issues. Several photographs were taken of Julian for the purpose of this report. While on scene, Julian provided me with a written statement (MSP 076).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I made contact with Jala, she was read her Miranda Rights, and subsequently waived her rights to speak with me. Jala advised, she struggles to get along with her family members including Julian. Jala advised, she often leaves her residence to have sexual intercourse with men - either strangers or men she barely knows. Jala advised, she likes the feeling of having sex with many men, it made her feel wanted. Jala advised, on this day, she met a black male subject in the adjacent apartment complex, who asked her if she wanted to join him for some alcoholic beverages, which she found to be, &amp;quot;cool.&amp;quot; Jala advised, she did not expect to have sex with the male subject, but she wanted to hang out with someone, and make new friend. Jala advised, her father confronted her outside the building, and requested she returned home. Jala did return back to the residence, however; was reluctant to stay, and wanted to be on her own. Jala advised, her father made her get into the vehicle, and she began striking him over the head with her shoe from the passenger seat. Jala advised, she did not recall stating she wanted to kill herself, but did advise she tried to jump from the vehicle while it was moving. Jala advised, she would rather go to jail then sit in the hospital. Jala advised, she was previous brought to BWMC in 2018 for an emergency evaluation. Jala advised, she was taken in to a mental health facility for 60 days during that incident. Jala advised she is on prescribed medications for Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Disorder. Jala was not very descriptive on whether she was taking her medication as prescribed; she did advise she took her morning medication as prescribed on this day. While speaking with Jala I did not observe any injuries, however; I did observe several old, healed scars on her arms, which appeared to be wrist cuts, and burn wounds commonly associated with suicide attempts. Several photographs were taken of Jala for the purpose of this report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Jala was taken into my custody, and escorted into the Emergency Room Intake at BWMC, and a Petition for Emergency Evaluation was completed. While in the hospital Jala, she became uncooperative with medical staff, refusing to change into scrubs - walking away from staff. After several minutes, Jala complied, and was admitted into the Behavioral Health Unit. Jala was left in the care and custody of hospital staff.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; Julian was provided a victim/witness pamphlet, including this case number. A Domestic Violence Supplement was not completed, as it did not fit the criteria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At no time, did Jala or Julian make any statements about suicide by firearm. Neither Jala nor Julian have access or own any firearms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; Case remains open pending the issuance of charging documents for Jala for Second Degree Assault, Disorderly Conduct, and Distrubing the Peace.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
