         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;ATTACHMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Washington County CPS Intake Worksheet, placed in case file.&lt;br /&gt; 2.)CD of forensic interview of the alleged victim, placed in case file.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On May 5, 2023, I, Sgt. Angermeier was notified by Washington County CPS of an incoming case of alleged child sex abuse. It was reported that a 16 year old female disclosed that when she was 14 years old, her aunt, Tina Wright, 27 YOA, would &amp;quot;grope her breasts on multiple occasions.&amp;quot; It was reported by the victims mother, that the victim suffers from bipolar, depression, and she is hypersexual. (The victim would later disclose she is hypersexual during the interview.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On May 8, 2023 at approximately 1003 hours, CAC/Safe Place Supervisor/Case Worker, Rachel Mazloum conducted a forensic interview on victim, Yemaya Ramirez, 16 YOA. The interview was recorded and I was present for the interview in the observation room. CW Mazloum used the Child First protocol while interviewing Yemaya.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CW Mazloum began with rapport building and going over who&amp;nbsp;Yemaya lives with.&amp;nbsp;Yemaya advised she likes chickens, turkeys, and multiple other farm animals.&amp;nbsp;Yemaya advised she lives with her grandmother, Debra, and mother, Karla.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CW Mazloum asked&amp;nbsp;Yemaya if she knew why she as there for an interview and advised, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; She went on to explain that she used to live with her aunt (Tina Wright) and her uncle (Daniel Wright) and her aunt &amp;quot;sexually assaulted me.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Yemaya went on to explain that Tina &amp;quot;gropped me.&amp;quot; She advised Tina would get into bed with her and touch her breasts.&amp;nbsp;Yemaya said she went and told her uncle, Daniel and he called her a &amp;quot;dyke&amp;quot;(lesbian) and that she should have liked it.&amp;nbsp;Yemaya also advised her aunt would come into the bathroom, walk up behind her and reach around and touch her breasts.&amp;nbsp;Yemaya advised this happened at her aunt and uncles former residence of&amp;nbsp;17737 Burnside Avenue Hagerstown, MD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Yemaya advised she was fourteen years old when these incidents occurred. She also explained that Tina would only touch her above her clothes, not underneath.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Yemaya explained there was a time when Tina ran her hand up her thigh near her underwear line, never touching her vagina.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Yemaya then went on to explain that she witnessed Tina &amp;quot;grinding&amp;quot; on her dog and touching its penis. She advised this dog is now deceased.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The interview concluded at 1100 hours. See the recorded interview on CD for further details.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On May 9, 2023, I contacted Tina Wright via phone. Tina advised she currently has covid, and she would come to the MSP Hagerstown Barrack on Monday May, 15th at 0900 hours for an interview.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On May 15, 2023 at approximately 0802 hours, Tina was interviewed in the MSP Hagerstown Barrack conference room. She agreed to a recorded interview. She was read her Advice of Miranda Rights and elected to speak to me without an attorney present. In short, she advised she never touched Yemaya ever in a sexual manner, nor did she ever touch Yemaya&amp;#39;s breasts. Tina did state there was a time she told Yemaya that she had breast implants due to having body insecurities. She also advised there was a time her and Yemaya went shopping for new bathing suits and she helped adjust her top, but never touched her breasts. I asked Tina regarding getting into bed with Yemaya and she confirmed she would get in bed with her at times due to her suffering from depression, but never touched her in any sexual manner whatsoever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This case was briefed with Assistant State&amp;#39;s Attorney Christine Remsburg. Due to the lack of corroboration, this case is closed, lack of prosecution.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Washington County, MD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
