         <NarrativeText>DUI Case #: 23-030&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Video &amp;ndash; M-6 In-car and body worn camera video available&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Phase #1 - Personal Contact (pre-exit interview)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On Saturday 3/18/23 at approximately 2233 hours, I, Senior Trooper Horst, was dispatched to a motor vehicle collision with the striking vehicle failing to stop at the scene (See attached ACRS report). The complainant called the JFK Highway Barrack stating a red possibly Toyota with an unknown VA registration struck the front quarter panel of their vehicle with the rear passenger side and continued traveling. Upon arriving on scene I observed the damage. The driver was identified as Ronald Handwerk by his MD driver&amp;#39;s license and the front seat passenger as Ashley Handwerk by her MD drivers license. They stated the vehicle struck them and then accelerated and was having trouble maintaining their lane of travel until they lost sight of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At approximately 2250 hours, Trooper Myers stopped the vehicle involved in the hit-and-run. The vehicle was a red Toyota Prius bearing VA registration &amp;quot;TUC7595&amp;quot; (See supplement).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; After learning of the traffic stop, I arrived on scene to speak with the driver regarding my accident investigation. Upon making contact with the driver, identified as Dielco Souza by his VA drivers license, I observed his eyes to be bloodshot and glassy, he appeared to be unsteady on his feet and a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emitting from his breath and person. I then questioned Souza about the hit-and-run accident. He stated he was having an argument with his passenger and sideswiped a vehicle next to him. I asked him if he planned on not stopping after, and he stated &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;. I questioned Souza about alcohol consumption, and he stated he had three (3) white claw alcoholic beverages with his last drink at 2000 hours. I requested Souza perform Standard Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) to which he complied.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Phase #2 - Pre-Arrest Screening&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked Souza the following questions:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Medications - No&lt;br /&gt; Eyeglasses - Yes, near-sighted&lt;br /&gt; Contact lenses - No&lt;br /&gt; Recent head trauma - No&lt;br /&gt; Physical abnormalities - Arthritis in both knees but stated he could walk properly without limping&lt;br /&gt; Any addictions or substance abuse &amp;ndash;No&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I am trained through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in performing Standard Field Sobriety Tests. Tests were performed on a smooth surface free of any debris.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. A black ballpoint pen was used as the test&amp;#39;s stimulus and held approximately 12 inches from Souza&amp;#39;s eyes. Souza was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. Souza&amp;#39;s pupils were equal in size and showed equal tracking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus - 6 of 6 clues&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Equal tracking and equal pupil size &amp;ndash; Present in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; Lack of Smooth Pursuit - Present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation - Present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; Onset of Nystagmus Prior to Reaching 45 Degrees - Present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *Divided Attention Tests&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The second test offered was the Walk and Turn test - 3 of 8 clues&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Prior to Souza performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Souza was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. Souza was instructed to place his hands flat at his side and to remain in the position until told to begin. Souza was advised to take nine (9) steps on a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. He was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and to count every step aloud. On the ninth step, Souza was demonstrated and explained to keep his lead foot on the line, and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. Souza was again explained and demonstrated the second series of steps were to be performed identical to the first series. Souza was advised once he started the test, he was not to stop until the test was completely finished. After explaining and demonstrating the test, I asked Souza if he completely understood the instructions, and he acknowledged that he understood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *Instructional Phase&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *Walking Phase&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; First 9 Steps&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; - Missed touching heel to toe by more than 1 inch on steps 6,8 and 9.&lt;br /&gt; -Took 10 steps instead of the instructed 9.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Turn&lt;br /&gt; Performed improperly. Did not take the small choppy steps as instructed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Second 9 Steps&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Missed touching heel to toe by more than 1 inch on steps 2,3,4,6 and 8.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The next test offered was the One Leg Stand &amp;ndash; 3 of 4 clues&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Prior to Souza performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. Souza was instructed to stand with his feet together and hands down to his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. Souza was instructed not to begin the test until he was instructed to start, and after the test had been demonstrated. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately six (6) inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, keep his toe pointed forward, watch his raised foot, and to count out loud by thousands (one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand...) and to continue the test until told to stop (30 seconds). Souza was asked if he understood the test and the instructions given, and he acknowledged that he did.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *Instructional Phase&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *Balance and Counting Stage&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1-10&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Put foot down on count 5.&lt;br /&gt; -Swayed on counts 3 and 10.&lt;br /&gt; -Raised arms off sides on counts 1-10.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Seconds 11-20&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Put foot down on counts 11, 17 and 20.&lt;br /&gt; -Swayed on counts 11,15 and 16.&lt;br /&gt; -Raised arms off sides on counts 11-20.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Seconds 21-30&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Put foot down on counts 24 and 27.&lt;br /&gt; -Raised arms off side on counts 21-30.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Souza was offered a preliminary breath test and agreed to submit. The results were a .08 BaC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Because of the above observations, I believed Souza was unable to operate a vehicle safely, and he was placed under arrest for driving under the influence at 2322 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; While speaking with the passenger of the vehicle, I looked at the cup holder and noticed a white claw alcoholic beverage can. The passenger took it out and looked at the can and stated she did not drink out of it because there was no lipstick on it. The can was empty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Souza was transported to the JFK Highway Barrack. While in my vehicle, I was able to detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath and person. Souza was read his DR-15 Advice of Rights and elected to submit to the intoximeter test at 0003 hours.&amp;nbsp;Souza&amp;#39;s breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .07 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath at 0014 hours. The intoximeter test was administered by Sgt. Phillips on intoximeter #011749.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Souza was released from the JFK Highway Barrack to a sober driver.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Case closed by arrest.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-9db0fb13-7fff-4bf8-376b-ccf3511014d6"&gt;On 3/18/2023, at approximately 2250 hours,I, Trooper Myers was working routine patrol when I observed a 2007 red Toyota Prius VA registration TUC7595, with an inoperable headlight. I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle S/B I-95 at the 81.4 mile marker. I made contact with the driver, Dielco Souza, identified by his Virginia driver&amp;rsquo;s license and advised him of the reason for the stop. Upon my initial approach, I observed damage to the rear passenger side of the vehicle. Prior to the traffic stop, S/T Horst #5840 responded to a hit and run motor vehicle collision S/B I-95 at the 100 mile marker, and the striking vehicle was described as a red passenger vehicle with a Virginia registration with passenger side damage. I questioned Souza about the damage, but he stated it was from a previous incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-9db0fb13-7fff-4bf8-376b-ccf3511014d6"&gt;Upon another approach to the vehicle, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Souza&amp;rsquo;s vehicle. Souza&amp;rsquo;s eyes appeared to be bloodshot and glassy and his speech was slurred. I further questioned Souza about the collision, and he stated if he did hit another vehicle, he was not aware. Souza stated they were coming from Delaware from an event and originally stated he had nothing to drink when questioned. Souza then stated he had consumed a couple of alcoholic beverages at the event. I contacted S/T Horst and advised him I believed this was the striking vehicle in the accident he was investigating, and he responded to my location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-9db0fb13-7fff-4bf8-376b-ccf3511014d6"&gt;The passenger in the vehicle, Kathy Nguyen, identified by her Maryland driver&amp;rsquo;s license, stated she knew they had hit another vehicle. Nguyen stated that she and Souza got into a verbal argument while traveling on I-95, and Souza began driving aggressively and struck another vehicle but did not stop. There were open alcoholic beverages located inside the vehicle and Nguyen stated Souza had consumed one of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong id="docs-internal-guid-9db0fb13-7fff-4bf8-376b-ccf3511014d6"&gt;All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>
