Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report was also completed for both parties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Narrative:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 6/2/2023 at about 2146 hours, I responded to 12118 Greencastle Pike, Hagerstown, Maryland, for a report of a subject having a mental breakdown and destroying the residence. Upon my arrival, I made contact with suspect Jayden Robert Kelly. Jayden was very irate and upset and felt that his parents did not love him anymore and that he was not welcome to stay there anymore. Once I was able to get Jayden to calm down by letting him vent he explained to me that today was a rough day for him. Jayden said he attended the Waynesboro Senior High School graduation today because his brother would have graduated today, but he committed suicide a few months ago. Jayden explained that it was very emotional for him, and then when he returned home later on in the evening, he found his cat was outside, and it was inside cat. Which was when he admitted he lost his temper, especially with his dad. Jayden admitted to me during the argument he did punch his father in the face because he wanted to leave the residence, but his parents felt it wasn&amp;#39;t a good idea. After Jayden struck his father they locked him out of the house and his parents told him to leave. Jayden told them that he would leave if they would let him get a couple of things, and he would be on his way, but they refused to let him. Jayden then became even more irate and began kicking the inside door and breaking the glass on the door. Jayden sustained a small cut on his left foot. Jayden&amp;rsquo;s parents then told him he needed to leave and that they called the police. So in fear, Jayden left, but he knew he needed to return because he knew it was wrong to leave before the police showed up. Jayden explained to me, he is bipolar and has manic episodes and takes medication. Jayden stated he did not take his medication today because he was out and could not pick up his medicine from the pharmacy until tomorrow. I asked Jayden multiple times if he had any suicidal thoughts or wanted to hurt himself, and he stated, &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;, I just want to go to my girlfriend&amp;#39;s house.&amp;nbsp; During the altercation, Jayden said no weapons were used and there was no mention of any firearms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; I spoke with Darren Robert Kelly who related the same chain of events leading up to the dispute. Darren advised it was a rough day for everyone and he and his wife felt it was just not a good idea for Jayden to leave for the night because of Jayden&amp;#39;s medical history. Darren said that Jayden did strike him in the face which knocked his glasses off and broke them, &amp;nbsp;he also threw his vape pen at him which then broke once it hit the wall. Darren said he was going to let Jayden gather some things from the residence until Jayden stated he was going to punch everybody in the house. That&amp;#39;s when he locked Jayden out. At this point, Jayden began kicking the door and broke through the glass. When the glass shattered Darren was close enough to the door that some glass caught Darren&amp;#39;s left elbow and cut him. Darren then told Jayden the police were on their way and that he needed to leave now. Jayden then sped off in his vehicle. At which this point his wife and daughter left the residence and did not return while Darren waited for the police to arrive. While speaking with Darren I did not observe any markings on his face from where he was struck, but I did see blood on his shirt from where his elbow was cut. Darren stated, &amp;quot;he did not want to pursue any assault charges on Jayden regarding the incident, but he just wanted him to leave and if I could help Jayden because he felt he was suicidal&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; I asked Darren if he made any type of suicidal comment, and he said, &amp;quot;NO, but he has in the past and did see a doctor for it&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; During the altercation, Darren said no weapons were used and there was no mention of any firearms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The domestic violence supplemental reports were completed for both parties involved. Darren screened in but did not want to speak with the counselor and Jayden did not screen in. I then spoke to Jayden again asking him if was ok, if wanted to speak with anybody, and he stated, &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;. I asked him if had suicidal thoughts or wanted to cause harm to himself or others, and he stated, &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; I then spoke with Darren and informed him I did not have enough for an emergency petition, and he understood. I then proceeded to ask him if wanted to pursue any charges, and he stated, &amp;quot;No as long as he leaves for the night.&amp;quot; Darren said that he felt better about Jayden&amp;#39;s mental state once he left, and he just couldn&amp;#39;t believe he acted like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Due to Darren not wanting to pursue any charges, Jayden was released from the scene and I will follow up with both parties tomorrow to see if anything changes regarding this incident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Washington County Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case Status: &amp;quot;Open until both parties are contacted&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
