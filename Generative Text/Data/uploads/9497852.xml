         <NarrativeText>NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On January 1, 2023, at approximately 0149 hours, I, TFC Capranica #6564, with the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, responded to the St. Michaels Inn at&amp;nbsp;1228 South Talbot Street, St. Michaels, Talbot County, MD for the report of a disturbance. The complainant advised they had heard yelling and fighting, between and male and female, coming from room #103.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;St. Michaels Police Officers (SMPD) were first on scene and made contact with the female party, Camryn Phillips. SMPD Officer&amp;#39;s advised the male party, Mason Kelley, had left the hotel, prior to their arrival, in a black Ford Focus displaying a MD registration, belonging to Phillips.&amp;nbsp;Dispatch advised Phillips currently had an active protection order against Kelley through Caroline County.&amp;nbsp;While in route to the scene, just prior to receiving this information, a vehicle matching that description, passed me at a high rate of speed, headed in the opposite direction, towards Easton. Myself and a Talbot County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Deputy turned around and attempted to catch up to the vehicle, however we lost sight of it and were unable to locate it. Phillips later advised she was okay with Kelley using her vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I continued back to the St. Michaels Inn and made contact with Phillips. SMPD advised they observed a minor injury to her right elbow, and she had already advised she did not need medical attention. It appeared she had been staying in the room for an extended period of time, and she had her two young children with her, a three-year-old and a 3-month-old. I asked Phillips about the living situation, and she advised she had been staying there temporarily with the kids until she could move into a more permanent living situation at the Benedictine Shelter in Ridgely. I inquired about Phillips&amp;#39; relationship with Kelley, and she advised they have been together approximately four years, have two children together, and have an intimate relationship.&amp;nbsp;I asked her if Kelley was supposed to be staying there too, and she advised he had just gotten out of jail in Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County and wanted to see her and the two kids, that are his. I inquired about the protection order that Phillips has against Kelley, and she advised the judge in Caroline County modified it, so Kelley could see her and the kids.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I asked her what happened and why there was yelling that caused someone in another room to call 911. Phillips advised that Kelley was upset because she was not giving him any attention, and he wanted to have sex, but she told him she was trying to put the kids to bed. I observed a minor abrasion to Phillips&amp;#39; right elbow and asked her how it happened. Phillips was hesitant to tell me, but admitted Kelley had pushed her onto the bed and onto the floor a few times, but she could not remember exactly when the injury to her elbow occurred or specific details. Phillips eventually advised Kelley had &amp;quot;strangled&amp;quot; her at one point, however I did not observe any marks, bruising, or injuries to Phillips&amp;#39; neck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dispatch located a copy of the protection order and emailed it to me, while I was on scene. I reviewed the document and explained to Phillips that I did not see any verbiage on the order that allowed Kelley to be around her or the children. I further explained that even if it had been modified to allow him to see the kids, he violated the order by assaulting her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Talbot County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>This incident was captured on camera.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=de728bb6df1544b9820a5b7b5cb765aa&amp;amp;partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1" target="_blank"&gt;BODY CAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NEIGHBORHOOD CHECK:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;1228 South Talbot Street &lt;strong&gt;Room&amp;nbsp;#102&lt;/strong&gt; St. Michaels Rd, St. Michaels, MD 21663, Complainant- Brianna advised SMPD that the male and female in room #103 had been yelling and fighting with each other.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;SCENE PROCESSING:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTOS UPLOADED TO VERIPIC &lt;/strong&gt;showing minor injury to victim&amp;#39;s elbow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:14px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; While on scene, I completed an MSP Domestic Violence Supplement Report (Form 246) with Phillips. She did screen in as &amp;ldquo;High-Danger&amp;rdquo;, according to protocol, but did not wish to speak with a counselor at the time. I advised her I would be contacting a counselor, and she would be receiving a call from Mid-Shore Domestic Violence Council to follow up with her about the incident. Phillips advised she was familiar with the service and had recently contacted them. I took photos of the minor injury to Phillips&amp;#39; left elbow. Phillips advised she did not want Kelley charged with anything. I advised Phillips that based on her statements and my observations, I had no choice, but to charge Kelley with assault and violating the protective order. I explained to her that I would be applying for criminal charges against Kelley in hopes to receive a criminal warrant for his arrest. I advised Phillips that if Kelley came back to the hotel, she needed to contact police immediately. I contacted the on-call counselor, Robin Sample, at 0430 hours, to advise her of the incident. I advised her Phillips had screened-in as &amp;ldquo;High Risk&amp;rdquo;, however, because it was late, and she was trying to get the kids to sleep, she wished to be contacted later. Robin advised she would contact Phillips later that day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The following day, January 2, 2023, D/Sgt. Williams, contacted me via email, advising he attempted to complete a domestic violence follow-up with Phillips, via phone but was unable to get a hold of her. However, he reached out to the Mid-Shore Counselor, Robin, who advised Phillips was involved in another similar domestic assault incident with Kelley earlier that day, resulting in an arrest by Officer Newcomb with St. Michael&amp;#39;s Police Department (SMPD). According to MD Case Search, Kelley was charged with 2nd Degree Assault and Violating a Protective Order is currently being held without bond awaiting a district court date on March 13, 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On January 3, 2023, I completed an application of charges against Kelley, requesting he is charged with 2nd Degree Assault, Reckless Endangerment, and Violating a Protective Order. The Commissioner issued an arrest warrant for all requested charges, additionally charging Kelley with 1st Degree Assault. On January 4, 2023, at 0600 hours, I responded to the Talbot County Detention Center and served Kelley with the warrant. Kelley immediately got an attitude with me, as if he knew why I was there. I attempted to explain the charges to Kelley, however he was rude and disrespectful and did not want to hear what I had to say. He stated he just wanted to sign the paperwork, and he would read it for himself later. I asked Kelley if he wanted to give me his side of the story from that night. Kelley became irate and started to argue he was not there that night. I provided Kelley with a copy of the application and charges. According to MD Case Search, Kelley is being held without bond, awaiting a Preliminary Hearing date on January 24, 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Talbot County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
