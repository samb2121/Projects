         <NarrativeText>This case was captured on In-car camera (T-16) and Body Worn Camera (#6301).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Attachments:&lt;br /&gt; MSP89B- Death Investigation Report&lt;br /&gt; MSP91D-Vehicle Inventory Checklist&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Evidence:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; 13 (Thirteen) Color Images were captured and uploaded to this report.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 12/3/2023 at approximately 0130 hours, I, Senior Trooper Oyler #6301 of the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack, responded for a motor vehicle collision into a structure at 21504 Exquisite Drive, Lexington Park, MD 20653. While responding St. Mary&amp;#39;s County Dispatch updated incoming units that the caller advised the vehicle &amp;quot;just tapped&amp;quot; the trailer and there were no injuries.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arrival at approximately 0134 hours, it became clear that the incident was much more severe than had been described. As I exited my unmarked patrol vehicle, I approached the car, a white Scion TC, MD registration 2FC3499, into a trailer home, and observed there was a driver trapped inside. I was able to reach my arm inside the vehicle enough to reach the driver to feel for a brachial pulse. When I could not feel a brachial pulse, I switched to feel for a carotid pulse, which there was none. I advised over the radio that there was no pulse. The operator of the vehicle appeared to be an un-belted male, wearing a t-shirt and sweat pants. I noted blood to his forehead, but no other signs of external trauma. There was apparent deformity to the steering wheel and the driver&amp;#39;s seat, in addition to the front end damage to the vehicle. It should be noted that there was a tire, mounted on a wheel, on the passenger seat close to where the driver&amp;#39;s head was resting, numerous large nails, glass, a car jack, and various other factors that made extrication impossible for first arriving units without protective gear. The fire department arrived a brief time later, extricated the driver from the vehicle, and began CPR. Reconstruction was requested. At 0153 hours EMS Chief Thomas Raley declared time of death. (EMS run number #15558).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There was no ID on the victim and few of the witnesses spoke English well enough to be interviewed. There were two subjects inside the residence that were identified and provided their names and contact information, Ilsy Florian (DOB: 3/3/1989, 240-431-0162) and Francisco Arma Mazariegos Galicia (DOB: 1/21/1985, 240-431-8895). As more of the community was made aware of the situation, a neighbor came forward and said that they believed the driver lived at 46102 Pleasant Drive, Lexington Park, MD 20653. Additional law enforcement maintained control of the scene while I went to this address and contacted a subject by the name of Brenda Coembera (DOB: 7/15/1975, 240-431-2675). With help from her teenage son, I was able to speak to Coembera and confirm that the driver was the registered owner Julio Cesar Martinez (DOB:10/3/1965) and that he did reside at the Pleasant Drive address. Combera invited me into Martinez room and I was able to observe many beer bottles on the night stand and floor and music still playing on a phone in his bed. Photos of his room were taken and uploaded to this report. Coembera said that Martinez had a problem with alcohol, but no health problems. She also said that he had no family in the US and that they were the closest that he had to family. Due to the circumstances, I elected to make death notification to Coembera of Martinez&amp;#39;s death. She and her family then accompanied me to the crash scene where they spoke with other members of the community about contacting his family over seas.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TFC Engleman responded for the reconstruction as well as FI Webber (OCME # 2314936). At the conclusion of the forensic investigation and reconstruction Brinsfield Funeral Home was contacted to transport the deceadants body to the OCME for autopsy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PJ&amp;#39;s Towing responded to remove the vehicle where it will be stored on a 72 hour hold for further reconstruction investigation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Finally, The residence at 21504 Exquiste Drive was deemed unsound by the fire department and the family was displaced. They elected to self re-locate to a friends home at 21570 S. Essex Drive., Lexington Park, MD&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An MSP 91D, Vehicle Inventory Checklist was completed and is attached to this report.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An MSP 89B, Death Investigation Report was completed the same day as this incident, emailed to homicide and the medical examiner and is attached to this report.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case Closed.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
