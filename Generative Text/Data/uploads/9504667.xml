         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Unmarked S-12&lt;br /&gt; Copy of Emergency Petition&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 09/29/2023 at approximately 0606 hours, I, Trooper First Class Maranto #7116 of the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack was on patrol in full uniform, operating unmarked MSP vehicle S-12, when I was dispatched to 116 White House Road, Grasonville, Maryland 21638 for the report of a female who had locked herself in a bathroom threatening to commit suicide.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon my arrival, I made contact with the female juvenile sitting in the living room. I asked for her information. A name and date of birth positively identified her as Valentina Rivero Acevedo (H/F DOB: 07/17/2008) of 116 White House Road, Grasonville, Maryland 21638. I asked Valentina what was going on this morning. Valentina advised that her mother Raquel, had been attempting to take her cellular phone away from her. Raquel wanted her to unlock her phone, to see who she was texting. Valentina refused, and her mother began demanding her phone. Valentina stated that her mother then took the cell phone from her and went to the basement. Valentina stated that her mother then smashed the phone with a hammer. Valentina stated that her mother struck her with a cable twice while she was attempting to take the phone. I asked Valentina if she had any injuries and she said &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; At the time she was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, and I did not observe any injuries on her person.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I then went upstairs and spoke with the mother separately. I asked for her information. A name and date of birth positively identified her as Raquel Judith Rivero Acevedo (H/F DOB: 01/06/1982) of 116 White House Road, Grasonville, Maryland 21638. I asked Raquel what was happening this morning. Raquel advised that she had taken her daughters&amp;#39; cell phone approximately 3 days earlier and hide it from her. She did this because she was texting a male whom she did not know, and Valentina would not tell her who it was. This morning when Raquel woke up, she looked for the phone she had hidden in her room, and realized it was gone. She went over to Valentina&amp;#39;s room and confronted her about it. Valentina refused to give up the phone, and became irate. Valentina then grabbed a small knife. Raquel then struck Valentina with a cable cord twice. Raquel then took the phone down to the basement and broke it. Raquel advised the phone was hers, and she had given it to Valentina to use, but since she was not obeying what she was asked of, she took the phone away and broke it. When Raquel went back upstairs, Valentina was holding a knife and told her mother she was going to &amp;quot;Kill myself&amp;quot;. Valentina then locked herself in the bathroom, and Raquel called 911.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I then went backstairs and spoke to Valentina about the knife. I asked her about the knife, and what her intentions were. Valentina admitted to me that she did want to harm herself. Valentina advised she was sad and depressed, and had thought about committing suicide. At 0631 hours, I placed Valentina in custody for an emergency petition. I advised her mother that she was being transported to Anne Arundel Medical Center. At Anne Arundel Medical Center, Valentina told me she had previously cut herself, and had taken prescription pills in attempt to commit suicide. Valentina advised she was sad because her friends all live in Virginia, and she does not like attending Kent Island High School. Valentina expressed that she was sad and depressed most of the time. Valentina stated that her mother was abusive to her and hits her when she doesn&amp;#39;t listen to her. I did not observe signs of physical abuse on Valentina. The charge nurse at AAMC then reached out to Child Protective Services in Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County. I spoke with Child Protective Services later in the day and explained to them the situation. Child Protective Services advised they would follow up with the family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I request this case be closed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
