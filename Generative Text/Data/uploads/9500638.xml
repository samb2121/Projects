         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 05/10/2023 at approximately 1834 hours, I (TFC Hook) was dispatched to 142 Old Frostburg Road, Frostburg, Garrett County, Maryland, to do premise check of a possible burglarized residence. The McHenry Barrack received a call from a Linda Grooms Sowers (07/06/1958) stating that West Virginia State Police contacted her and stated that her husband&amp;#39;s 1958 Chevrolet Corvette was recovered from the 21 mile-marker of I-68 in Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. Sowers called the McHenry Barrack assuming that their residence had been burglarized.&amp;nbsp; I arrived on the scene, along with TFC Bradley, and from the roadway I observed that the large garage door was open on the front of the two-story residence.&amp;nbsp; Fresh spin marks could be observed in the gravel driveway from the garage to the blacktop roadway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; TFC Bradley and I cleared the residence. While clearing the residence, most interior doors were shut and no lights were on. The only interior lights that were on were the game room lights just inside the open garage and the master bathroom room lights inside the master bedroom. In the kitchen, on the second floor, the window above the kitchen sink had been shattered and glass was covering the counter, kitchen table, and floor, A red brick was observed laying on the table where it landed. The brick landed a coaster breaking it. The door leading to the kitchen appeared to be pried open, with fresh marks just above the door latch. The exterior door located to the left of the broken kitchen window was unlocked. An exterior patio door leading to the upper deck out of the family room / living room was also unlocked. One couch in the living room had two blankets laid down and one of the blankets was bunched up. A pair of gray &amp;quot;Polo&amp;quot; brand socks were on the floor in front of the couch. I observed the house was very neatly kept. No other damage or disturbed items could be observed inside the residence. Outside the residence, I took notice that the lawn was freshly cut. I contacted the McHenry Barrack and briefed them of what was observed.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The Barrack Duty Officer contacted the homeowners back who advised they were en route from Fairfax, Virginia. Crime Scene and CED were also contacted. CED did not respond, however, Crime Scene Tech Jeudy stated she would respond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; TFC Bradley completed a neighborhood check while I secured the residence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -294 Old Frostburg Road - Andrea Lynn Matthew (11/1/1989) - Stated she saw a dark blue truck with trailer around 1500 hours. (Belonged to Ronald Fagley)&lt;br /&gt; -438 Beall School Road - Russell Cutter (09/04/1966) - Nothing observed.&lt;br /&gt; -478 Beall School Road - Tom Friend (08/02/1956) - Does maintenance for homeowners and has a key, but wasn&amp;#39;t present and did not observe anything suspicious. Also stated that there was a tree planting company planting trees to the rear of 142 Old Frostburg Road the past several days.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;TFC Bradley then responded to Ronald Fagley&amp;#39;s residence located at 1017 Finzel Road. Fagley stated he mowed the grass starting at 0930 hours to around 1200 hours. Fagley stated that he starts mowing at residence located at 142 first and then mows the property located just beside that residence. Fagley did state the gate leading towards the rear deck was open (he closed it before he left) and the door was open on the abandoned residence located beside 142 (Also owned by the Sowers), and he closed the door and called the owners to inform them. Fagley stated he didn&amp;#39;t observe anything else while he was mowing. TFC Bradley gathered all pertinent information and provided it to me.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sgt. Bond spoke to Sgt Belt with the West Virginia State Police. Sgt. Belt advised that the Corvette was located at the 21 MM in Bruceton Mills and has since been stored at CJ Towing located on Walt Teets Road in Bruceton Mills. Sgt. Belt would also advise that a short while after the vehicle was stored, they received and anonymous phone call from a female stating she picked up the male subject that was with the Corvette. The female stated that she took the male to a restaurant in the Morgantown area and dropped him off. The female told Sgt. Belt that the male admitted that he stole the Corvette. Sgt. Belt had the phone number the female called from and was going to attempt to track her down. Sgt. Belt also stated that he would have another Police Officer respond to the restaurant and try to locate video footage. All pertinent information was gathered from Sgt. Belt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; David Joshua Puckett (04/02/1985) then arrived at the residence to speak with me. Puckett stated that around 0800 hours in the morning, he observed a male walking down his driveway. He stated he drove the side by side out to him. The gentleman was described as clean cut and black hair, and stated he was lost. The male stated he was an electrician with Solar Holler Company that works on windmills. The male did not have a phone and was walking house to house looking for help. Puckett attempted to call his company for him but had negative results. The male would go on to state he was on his way from Morgantown to wherever he was working when his truck broke down on I-68 (E/B I-68 at Old Frostburg Road - Incident number 2023-00188906). Puckett then attempted to give the male a ride back to his truck, but the male couldn&amp;#39;t remember where it was located and Puckett just left the male on the side of the road by the SHA shop in Finzel. Puckett stated he never got the guys name, but they got a picture of the guy from the neighbors ring doorbell camera (The video surveillance is from 853 Saint Johns Rock Road, and the Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office has the video surveillance in their evidence). Puckett&amp;#39;s wife, Autumn, was able to send the picture to my email address.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The Garrett County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Department then contacted the Barrack and advised that they had just taken a report for a burglary located at 803 Saint Johns Rock in Finzel (Report number G2023-03470). The Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office stated that they believe the burglaries are related. It was reported that a male entered that residence at approximately 0600 hours by breaking in the front door of the residence. When the homeowner came out of his bedroom, the male was in the kitchen looking in the fridge. The homeowner had a brief conversation with the man, and he left. The neighbor had video surveillance of the man that was in his house. Deputy Beal responded to those residences and gathered all pertinent information and took that report. Deputy Beal learned from all the neighbors and information gathered that the suspect was the driver of the white Toyota Tacoma abandoned on I-68 at Old Frostburg Road.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; After speaking with Sgt. Bond, the decision was made to store the Toyota on I-68. TFC Bradley responded to that location. The truck was described as a white Toyota Tacoma bearing West Virginia registration of N3K917. That truck would be registered to Lester Eugene Turner Jr. (12/17/1988). TFC Bradley stated that the truck was in good condition and full of tools related to the electrical field of work. TFC Bradley completed the storage and the truck was towed by Kyle&amp;#39;s Towing. After locating an MVA photo of Turner, he was identified as the same male in the video surveillance photos. TFC Bradley returned to the scene.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sgt. Bell arrived with TFC Bradley, and they went to the abandoned residence located beside 142 Old Frostburg Road. The door was since closed like Fagley said. They entered the structure and found nothing was damaged or out of place. No further investigation is needed from the abandoned residence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; CST Jeudy arrived on the scene and photographed and processed the residence. While walking through the residence, CST Jeudy observed what she identified as blood on a plastic bag on the kitchen table near the broken window and on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen. CST Jeudy was able to swab both substances. No latent fingerprints could be located.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At approximately 2200 hours, Charles Francis Sowers Jr (05/07/1945) and Linda Groomes Sowers (07/06/1958) arrived at the residence. (Primary residence is 12202 Hollow Tree Lane, Fairfax, VA 22030.) All pertinent information was gathered from both. I completed a walk through of the residence with them. No other items were reported missing or broken at the time. Both Sowers believed the blankets were folded neatly on the couch and the socks did not belong to either one of them. The socks were seized. The key to the car was either located in the kitchen wall cabinet on the far right of the kitchen or in the center pull out tray of the red tool box in the garage. The key to the Corvette could not be located at that time. (Later learned that a key is not needed to start the car.) The Sowers also stated there was a garage door opener in the Corvette. All pertinent information was exchanged, and I cleared the scene.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At the Barrack, the socks were placed into the McHenry Barrack temporary evidence Locker according to MSP Policy and Procedure at approximately 2345 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 05/11/2023, I contacted CJ Towing. The tow company was able to provide me with the VIN (J58S108234). The tow company advised that the Corvette was still on the rollback and that no damage could be observed to the vehicle. He was unsure why the vehicle was not running. He was advised that CST Jeudy would be contacting him shortly. CST Jeudy did respond to CJ Towing on 05/11/2023 to photograph and process the vehicle. No latent fingerprints could be located, and the steering wheel and driver&amp;#39;s area was swabbed for DNA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sgt Belt contacted me on 05/11/2023 at approximately 1700 hours. Sgt Belt advised that Troopers made contact with the restaurant owner and video surveillance will be forwarded to him in the near future. Sgt. Belt also made contact with the anonymous caller. Sgt. Belt stated she wished to remain anonymous but believes when he makes contact with her in person, she would be willing to provide a written statement. The anonymous caller&amp;#39;s verbal statement was that she picked the male up by the Corvette on the roadside. The female stated that while traveling towards another location, the male started telling her how he broke into a house and stole that car. The female stated she became feared for her safety then dropped him off at the restaurant. The female described the male as nicely dressed in dark dress pants and a blue dress shirt, with dark hair and a beard. The male she described is the same male pictured in the surveillance footage Sgt. belt was not at his desk when he called me, so he was unable to provide me with the specific details. Sgt. Belt advised that once he had all evidence and written statements, he would deliver them to the McHenry Barrack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case remain open pending further investigation and charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 05/18/2023, I (TFC Hook) met with State&amp;#39;s Attorney Christian Mash, briefing him on the case. Afterwards, an application for charges was completed and submitted to the Garrett County Court Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office. An arrest warrant was issued for Turner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case remain open pending warrant service.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 06/03/2023, Carlos Williams (304-276-0083) contacted the McHenry Barrack on behalf of Teressa Turner (Lester&amp;#39;s wife). Carlos asked numerous question&amp;#39;s about Lester&amp;#39;s vehicle and gave the Duty Officer contact information for Teressa (304-906-9330). I made contact with Teressa via telephone. Teressa advised that Lester arrived home on 05/11/2023 without his truck and was having an obvious mental breakdown. Teressa stated that after a short while she had to call the police on Lester. Teressa stated that Lester was arrested and was committed to the&amp;nbsp;William R. Sharpe, Jr. Hospital in Weston, W.V. for a mental evaluation, where he spent 11 days. After Lester was released, Teressa advised he moved in with his brother, Brent, in Masontown, West Virginia. Teressa was unsure of that address but provided me with Brent&amp;#39;s phone number (304-777-3058) and his Aunt Kathy&amp;#39;s phone number (681-209-2148). Teressa provided me no other details regarding this case. Attempts to make contact with Brent were unsuccessful. I did make contact with Kathy, who stated she would relay all pertinent information to Lester the following day.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 06/04/2023, Lester called into the McHenry Barrack. I spoke with Lester over the phone for several minutes, he stated over and over that he is scared and does not know who he can trust. Lester also asked if I believed in God and made me promise I was a good person. I advised Lester that I needed him to come into the McHenry Barrack to sign the release form for his pickup and that there were also issues we needed to discuss. Lester stated &amp;quot;I know I did wrong, but I didn&amp;#39;t hurt anyone, and I am ready to take care of this.&amp;quot; Lester agreed to meet me at the McHenry Barrack on 06/05/2023 at 1400 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Lester arrived at the McHenry Barrack on 06/05/2023 at approximately 1700 hours. (My body worn camera and W-27&amp;#39;s in car camera captured the entire arrest.) I asked Lester into the back to the processing room where Lester was advised he was under arrest, and he was searched. Lester was then advised of his Miranda Rights, and agreed to voluntarily waive his rights knowing he could stop at anytime. I first began asking Lester about leaving his truck on the interstate, to which he stated it ran out of gas, and he also stated that he threw his wallet and phone out the window, and he does not know where his keys are located. Lester stated he believes he began to walk towards Morgantown and was picked up by a couple, but is not sure on what time he was picked up. Lester stated he knows he was dropped off at a restaurant. I then showed Lester the picture that was captured from video surveillance, and he stated &amp;quot;That is me.&amp;quot; As I asked Lester more questions about kicking the door down to enter another house or throwing a brick through a window and stealing a car, Lester stated twice &amp;quot;If you have video, I did it.&amp;quot; No matter what question I asked, Lester stated he did not remember. I later asked Lester about the Corvette he stole, and Lester did make a comment about he did not hot wire the car. While speaking with Lester, he did remain calm but continued to make limited eye contact while we spoke. Lester provided me no further information about the case. Lester did sign the release form for his pickup and was provided pertinent information to retrieve his truck from storage. Lester was fingerprinted and transported to the Garrett County District Court Commissioner for an initial appearance. The GCSO was unavailable, and I served their warrant for Turner. Turner was held on bond in both cases and transported to the Garrett County Detention Center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case remain open to obtain evidence from the West Virginia State Police.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 06/08/2023 at approximately 1015 hours, I (TFC Hook) responded to 853 Saint Johns Rock Rd, in Frostburg, Garrett County, Maryland. I met with the homeowner, Adam Fazenbaker, who was able to provide me video surveillance from May 10th, 2023. The video surveillance shows Turner walking down the walkway to the front door. Fazenbaker emailed the video to my email, and was then downloaded to USB #36 and was placed into the case file.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case remain open, pending evidence from Sgt. Belt of the West Virginia State Police.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 07/12/2023, I (TFC Hook) received through the U.S. mail, a copy of Sgt. Belt&amp;#39;s police report and a DVD containing digital evidence. (The digital evidence should contain the interviews of the witnesses and a copy of video surveillance from Turner getting dropped off at the restaurant by the witnesses.) The DVD was placed on an MSP Form 67 and both items were placed into the case file.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Garrett County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
