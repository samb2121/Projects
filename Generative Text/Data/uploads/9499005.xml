The facts contained herein are intended solely to give the prosecuting authority a basic understanding of the facts pertaining to this case. The facts contained herein are not intended to be an exhaustive recitation of the facts pertaining to pretrial or trial issues. Instead, this trooper anticipates that during the pretrial proceedings, in this case, the prosecutor will take the opportunity to interview this trooper in order to ascertain any and all relevant facts which might be the subject of this trooper&amp;rsquo;s testimony during court proceedings.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On 06/19/2023 at approximately 2150 hours, I (Tpr.B.Salgueiro #7370), was on duty officially as a Maryland State Trooper operating an unmarked MSP vehicle X-4. At approximately 2155 hours, I observed a vehicle parked in the travel portion of the Royal Farms parking lot, located at&amp;nbsp;12282 Brittingham Lane in Princess Anne, Maryland. The vehicle was a Black GMC pick-up bearing VA registration (7425XD). I approached the vehicle to check the welfare of the driver, who was at that time leaning against the driver seat of the truck and swaying appearing almost to be sleeping standing up. I spoke with the driver later identified as Bennie Hatney (DOB: 02-24-1966 B/M) by his VA identification card (T60543256). Hatney spoke with slurred speech as appeared to be in need of fuel. I parked my cruiser and exited my vehicle to speak with Hatney. Upon my approach on foot, I could smell the strong odor of an acholic beverage emitting from Hatney&amp;#39;s breath and this smell got stronger with every word Hatney spoke during our interaction. I asked Hatney where he was coming from, and he advised me that he had just left his &amp;quot;baby mama&amp;#39;s house&amp;quot; in Salisbury, Maryland. He advised me that he was indeed out of fuel and had just pulled into the gas station which I knew to be factual due to me observing Hatney traveling southbound 13 prior to Allen Rd a few minutes prior to my check welfare with Hatney. As we spoke he appeared disoriented and would change subjects as we spoke, all the while swaying from left to right and slurring most of his words. Due to my observations, I asked Hatney for his license and if he had consumed any Alcoholic beverages tonight. He responded with a clear &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and stated, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna be honest, I don&amp;#39;t have a license&amp;quot;. I then asked Hatney if he would be willing to perform STFT&amp;#39;s and as I asked Hatney placed his hands together and out in front of him, assuming he was going to be arrested. I explained to Hatney that I just wanted to make sure he was good to drive, and he then refused SFST&amp;#39;s and was placed under arrest for driving while intoxicated at 2201. Hatney was placed in custody without incident and transported to the Maryland State Police Princess Anne Barrack for processing and when transporting Hatney my vehicle then had the odor of acholic beverage present. While Processing Hatney he later admitted that he consumed Bud Light Platinum beer and shots of Brandy liquor in an undisclosed amount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;-PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. I observed the suspect vehicle in motion approximately 10 mins prior to checking its welfare at Royal Farms. I did not observe any moving violations at that time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;-PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon contact with the driver, I made the following observations:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. I exited my patrol car and observed the driver standing next to his truck with the driver&amp;#39;s door open and keys in the ignition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2. The driver was wearing a white tee shirt and a multi-colored hat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3. Upon my request for a driver&amp;#39;s license, the driver appeared disoriented.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 4. There was a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the driver and interior of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The driver advised the following:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. The driver stated he was driving from Salisbury to his residence in Pocomoke City.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. The driver was not injured and did not need medical attention.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3. The driver admitted to consuming alcoholic beverages prior to driving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I continued to make the following observations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1.&amp;nbsp;The driver produced a Virginia ID card.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. The driver was identified as Bennie Hatney (DOB: 02/24/1966 B/M)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;While interacting with&amp;nbsp;Hatney, I made the following observations:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. I could smell the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;strong odor of alcoholic beverage&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;emanating from his breath and person as he spoke.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. Hatney had&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;glassy and bloodshot&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;eyes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3. Hatney displayed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;glazed look/expression&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on his face as he interacted with me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 4. Hatney appeared unsteady on his feet, his body swaying to the left and right as he spoke with me. I informed Hatney that I wanted him to perform field sobriety tests which he refused to submit to.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;-PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; REFUSED BY SUSPECT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;**HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: Not conducted**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; REFUSED BY SUSPECT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;**WALK AND TURN: Not conducted**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; REFUSED BY SUSPECT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;**ONE LEG STAND: Not conducted**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; REFUSED BY SUSPECT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;**PBT RESULTS**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; NOT OFFERED TO SUSPECT&lt;br /&gt; .&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARREST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Based on the following, I had reason to believe Hatney was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; *The multiple times&amp;nbsp;Hatney stated he had consumed alcohol.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Eyes glassy and bloodshot.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Glazed look/expression on his face.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * My observed signs of impairment from Hatney.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I determined that Hatney was impaired by the presence of an alcoholic beverage in his system. I placed Hatney under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 2201 hours on 06/24/2023. At this time, I visually inspected the inside of Hatney&amp;#39;s mouth to check for foreign objects and none were found.&amp;nbsp; Hatney was secured and placed in the right front seat of my patrol vehicle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While in my patrol vehicle, the audio version of the DR15 Advice of Rights, from the Maryland MVA website was played to Hatney through my in-car computer.&amp;nbsp; At the conclusion of the audio version, Hatney stated that he understood his Advice of Rights and agreed to submit to a breath test at approximately 2223 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRANSPORT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hatney was subsequently transported to the Princess Anne Barrack for processing. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Hatney continued to be strong. Upon arrival at the Barrack, Hatney was placed in the DUI processing room.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; INTOXIMETER TEST&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The breath test was administered by SGT M. White #5242 at approximately 2237 hours on 06/19/2023, and two (2) sufficient samples of Hatney&amp;#39;s breath were obtained. The breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .257 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELEASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hatney was released to a sober driver (Tiarra M Scarborough DOB: 04-21-1989) at approximately 0130 hours on 06/20/2023.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHARGES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hatney was charged with the following citations:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1.&amp;nbsp;2LJ0XC3 DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. 2LK0XC3 DRIVING VEHICLE WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL PER SE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3. 2LL0XC3 DRIVING VEH.
