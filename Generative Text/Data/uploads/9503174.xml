         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.5pt"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color:white"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#222222"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On 3/23/2023, Sgt Roberts received information from a local Shipping company that they had a package that was flagged for containing a large amount of US Currency. Upon this notification Master Trooper Hood responded to the facility and took possession of the package. While at the facility Master Trooper Hood counted the currency in which the package contained $8,000.00. This package was taken to the Hagerstown Barrack where it was stored while the investigation continued. Sgt Roberts and M/T Hood initially spoke about a controlled delivery as this package was addressed to a local address in Williamsport Maryland. As the investigation continued M/T Hood and Sgt Roberts conducted surveillance on the residence that the package was sent to. At that time it appeared that this was part of an elderly scam. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.5pt"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color:white"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#222222"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On 3/24/2023, Master Trooper Hood and Sgt Roberts responded to 16918 Cavalry Dr. Williamsport MD 21795. In responding to the residence they made contact with Ms. Diana Payne. M/T Hood and Sgt Roberts sat down with Ms. Payne. She explained to them that she was waiting for a package from her sister-in-law Ms. Carolyn Reid. Ms. Reid who was also the sender on the package was showing an address of 383 Bulloch Cir. Washington UT 84790. She stated that the package was supposed to contain money that she was sending to her husband Mr. Price. In interviewing her she explained that she was married to a man who she stated was Mr. Price. She explained that she was married on the internet to this man. She stated that she was supposed to send him money as he was in the Army and stuck in Afghanistan. She stated that he was 73 years old and that she was supposed to send money to an attorney to help him get back to the United States. In speaking with her Sgt Roberts went through her phone with her as we believed Ms. Payne was being used in part of a scam. Ms. Payne&amp;#39;s phone was full of spam related phone numbers calling her on a regular basis. She showed Sgt Roberts a text conversation between her and this person she thought was Mr. Price. In the text Sgt Roberts observed a transaction receipt for $5,000.00 in bitcoin. She stated that on March 22, 2023, she received a package of $5,000.00 from another one of Mr. Price&amp;#39;s family members, and she took it to a Liquor store where she transferred it to Bitcoin. This was done on a Bitcoin exchange machine. Once it was taken to this location the currency was transferred to Bitcoin and transferred to an unknown account. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.5pt"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color:white"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#222222"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As Master Trooper Hood and Sgt Roberts believed Ms. Payne was being used in an elderly scam in order to clean the currency and convert it to Bitcoin they advised her of this. They provided her information on how to prevent this kind of scam and also contacted her daughter to explain the situation to her. Ms. Payne&amp;#39;s daughter was understanding and stated that her mother has been scammed in the past. One thing to note is that Ms. Payne stated that she has not sent any of her own currency however has purchased a few gift cards and given the numbers to individuals over the phone. Ms. Payne provided the information of a previous box to M/T Hood in which it came from a Betty Ange 5410 NC Highway 118, Grifton NC 28530. This is believed to be the sender of the $5,000.00. After speaking to the shipping company security team they have made contact with Ms. Ange and she stated that she sent Easter candy and that she did not wish to be contacted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.5pt"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color:white"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#222222"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 3/25/2023, Sgt Roberts contacted the Washington UT Police Department regarding making contact with Ms. Carolyn Reid. Sgt Roberts was later contacted by an Officer from the Washington Utah Police Department, Ian Atkinson. Officer Atkinson was briefed on the situation and informed Sgt Roberts that he would make contact with Ms. Reid. A few hours later Sgt Roberts was contacted by Officer Atkinson who informed Sgt Roberts that Ms. Reid did in fact send $8,000.00 to Ms. Payne. It was discovered by Officer Atkinson that Ms. Reid has been scammed for approximately $20,000.00 USD in various ways. Ms. Reid provided information to Officer Atkinson showing that she shipped this parcel and that she took $10,000.00 out of her bank account. She stated that she sent $8,000.00 in the parcel and purchased an additional $2,000.00 in Apple i-tunes gift cards that were also provided to someone she did not know. Officer Atkinson provided Sgt Roberts with a report number of 23Z002390 for his investigation and provided pictures of receipts and bank account information from Ms. Reid. M/T Hood and Sgt Roberts will work on getting the currency processed and returned to Ms. Reid. Sgt Roberts will contact Cpl. Mills in order to assist with any investigation into the $5,000.00 in Bitcoin that was transferred. At this time this case is open pending the return of the US Currency and additional investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
