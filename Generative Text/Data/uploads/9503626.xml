         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:16px"&gt;Unmarked S-12&lt;br /&gt; MSP Form 79 Missing Person Form&lt;br /&gt; MSP Form 79B Missing Person Certification&lt;br /&gt; Copy of NIC Number M267272156&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 04/15/2023 at approximately 1848 hours, I, Trooper First Class Maranto #7116 of the Maryland State Police Centreville barrack was on duty in full uniform operating unmarked MSP vehicle S-12. I was dispatched at 2029 Main Street, Chester, Maryland 21619, for the report of a runaway/missing juvenile.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Upon my arrival, I made contact with the female complainant. I asked for her information. A Maryland Driver&amp;#39;s License positively identified her as Taylor Bryce Thompson (2/F DOB: 08/29/1993) 2029 Main Street, Chester, Maryland 21619. I asked Taylor what happened today. Taylor advised that her stepdaughter Lillian had gone missing this evening. I asked Taylor for her stepdaughter full information. A name and date of birth, as well as a physical description positively identified her as Lillian Bailey Jacoby (2/F DOB: 11/27/2007) of&amp;nbsp;2029 Main Street, Chester, Maryland 21619.Taylor advised that she returned home around 1645 hours, and had seen her stepdaughter Lillian inside the home. Lillian was wearing pink leggings, but could not give me a further description of what else she was wearing. Lillian was described as a white female, approximately 5&amp;#39; 06&amp;quot; in height, 180 lbs in weight, with blueish green eyes, and red hair approximately down to her shoulders.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Taylor advised that Lillian is autistic, and is not allowed to leave the home unless given permission. Taylor advised me that she had noticed a white Nissan Armada in the driveway earlier, but did not have any vehicle registration information. She advised there was 4 suspicious looking people in the vehicle. She told me that the subjects in the vehicle were attempting to fix their front bumper, which was damaged. I asked Taylor if Lillian had run away from home before, and she advised she had not runaway, but had left the residence before when she or her father had disciplined her. Taylor advised she would usually go to Kent Island High School, or Love Point Park. Taylor also advised that she had a friend that lives in Chester Harbor, down the road, but was not sure of the friends name or residence number. Lillian does not have a cellular phone issued to her. I asked Taylor if there had been any arguing or a disagreement earlier, and she told me there hadn&amp;#39;t been.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I also made contact with the grandmother on scene. I asked for her information. A Maryland Driver&amp;#39;s License positively identified her as Nancy Rebecca Thompson (2/F DOB: 02/26/1996) of 109 Caroline Ave, Apartment D, Ridgley, Maryland 21660. Nancy also told me that she had not seen Lillian since earlier. Nancy was also concerned about her because she was Autistic, and a &amp;quot;very trustworthy person.&amp;quot; Nancy and Taylor both said that Lillian would go with anyone anywhere. I asked if she was nonverbal autistic or functioning, and they advised that she is verbal and can speak normally. Lillian will not respond if she thinks she&amp;#39;s getting into trouble or may not want to speak to law enforcement. I notified the barrack of the current information, and began searching last known locations with Trooper Passwaters #7367.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I searched the shopping centers located next to the missing juveniles home, which had negative results. I also searched the Kent Towne Market, which had negative results. The Red Apple Plaza, down to the Abruzzi Drive Apartments, and Shamrock Drive Apartments, also had negative results. Trooper Passwaters searched the Chester Harbor neighborhood, as well as Love Point Park, and surrounding areas with negative results. The BOLO was broadcast to Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County Sheriff&amp;#39;s office, and Maryland Transportation Authority Police at approximately 1918 hours. I also contacted the Kent Island Fire Department, and they were able to utilize their ATV, to take onto Terrapin Park Beach. I rode on the ATV, searching trails and the beach, with negative results. Sgt. Curley also contacted K-9 bloodhound for a track.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Trooper Passwaters stayed on scene, and spoke with a neighbor who came forward later on. The neighbor was positively identified as Jason Edward Movsesian (2/M DOB: 11/25/1974) of 2025 Main Street, Chester, Maryland 21619. Movsesian advised that around 1640 hours, he watched Lillian get into a white Toyota Sequoia with unknown vehicle registration, and leave the scene with an unknown occupant. K-9 TFC Graef arrived on scene and conducted a K-9 track, which had negative results and the K-9 did not leave the parking lot. Additional resources were contacted to assist in the search. Aviation was not utilized due to having no direction of travel, or a vehicle description. Lillian was entered into NCIC at 2127 hours via Centreville Barrack communications.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 04/17/2023, I was advised that the Criminal Enforcement Division had located Lillian and that they would lead the investigation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I request this case be closed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>

DOB: 11/27/2007). Upon their arrival, contact was made with the juvenile&amp;#39;s step-mother, Taylor Bryce Thompson (W/F DOB: 08/29/1993). Thompson stated Jacoby was missing when she returned home from work at approximately 1840 hours. Thompson advised Jacoby is autistic, and is not allowed to leave the home unless given permission. Thompson advised she had noticed a white Nissan Armada in the driveway earlier, but was unable to provide any vehicle registration information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Based on this information, troopers, MSP K9, deputies, EMS/fire personnel and investigators began an exhaustive search of the area to locate Jacoby. A K9 track of the residence was conducted, but was unsuccessful.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Initial reports described Jacoby as having non-verbal autism. However, follow-up interviews with the family indicated that Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s level of autism was not as significant as originally believed, as she has the ability to communicate and does not require substantial support to complete basic daily activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; MSP CED personnel arrived on scene at approximately 2300 hours and began interviewing neighbors, family members and friends. During an interview with a friend, Corporal Donald was able to obtain Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s Snapchat account. Additional interviews were conducted and indicated Jacoby had made previous threats of suicide and self harm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At approximately 0130 hours, Corporal Donald submitted an emergency disclosure request to Snapchat. Shortly thereafter, Snapchat provided data in reference to the emergency request. After reviewing the data, it was determined Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s Snapchat account utilized the IP address of 24.170.228.163 on 16 Apr 2023 00:13:25 UTC. An open source query of this IP address revealed that it belonged to Antietam Broadband. Furthermore, this IP address geolocated to Hagerstown, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald made numerous attempts to contact representatives with Antietam Broadband but was unsuccessful. At approximately 0750 hours, Corporal Donald made contact with representatives with Antietam Broadband and was able to submit an exigent request form to obtain subscriber information associated with the IP address. At approximately 0920 hours, representatives with Antietam Broadband advised the IP address belonged to M&amp;amp;T Bank located at 17301 Valley Mall Road STE 370 Hagerstown, MD 21740.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald contacted MSP CED West and investigators conducted an area canvas of the mall. Corporal Mills determined that the Wi-Fi at M&amp;amp;T Bank was open and did not require a password. Furthermore, Corporal Mills made contact with several businesses to obtain surveillance footage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At approximately 0947 hours, Corporal Donald submitted a second emergency disclosure request to Snapchat. Shortly thereafter, Snapchat provided data in reference to the emergency request. After reviewing the data, it was determined Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s Snapchat account utilized the IP address of 174.216.54.66 on approximately five separate occasions on April 16, 2023. An open source query of this IP address revealed that it belonged to Verizon Wireless. Furthermore, this IP address geolocated to Hagerstown, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald submitted an emergency request to Verizon to obtain subscriber information associated with the IP address. After submission of the emergency request, it was determined that the IP address belonged to a NATTING router and was utilized by approximately 150 users at the same time. Furthermore, without a port number, Verizon was unable to identify the subscriber.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald reviewed numerous tips from members of the public regarding Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s disappearance. One tip indicated that Jacoby was last seen at the Big Lots in Chester, Maryland at approximately 1700 hours. According to a sales associate, Jacoby stated she was waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up and drive her to Pennsylvania. Contact was made with the manager at Big Lots who advised there were no exterior cameras that would have captured the suspect or vehicle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On April 17, 2023 at approximately 1000 hours, Corporal Donald submitted a third emergency disclosure request to Snapchat. Shortly thereafter, Snapchat provided data in reference to the emergency request. After reviewing the data, it was determined Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s Snapchat account utilized the IP address of 76.5.116.77 Mon, 17 Apr 2023 12:39:35 UTC and seven additional occasions. An open source query of this IP address revealed that it belonged to CenturyLink . Furthermore, this IP address geolocated to Shippensburg, Pennsylvania.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At approximately 1030 hours, Corporal Donald submitted a demand letter to Lumen Technologies/CenturyLink requesting subscriber information. Shortly thereafter, Lumen Technologies/CenturyLink advised that the reported IP address belonged to Roxanne Hoover at the address of 4743 Chambersburg Road Biglerville, Pennsylvania 17307.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At approximately 1100 hours, Corporal Donald contacted the Pennsylvania State Police Gettysburg Barrack. Corporal Donald was put in contact with Corporal Reeser and Trooper Pasquale. At approximately 1300 hours, Trooper Pasquale and members of their Criminal Investigation Division went to 4743 Chambersburg Road Biglerville, Pennsylvania 17307. After making contact with the residents, troopers were invited inside the home and located Jacoby. Jacoby appeared to be unharmed and was cooperative with troopers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A preliminary investigation indicated Jacoby was picked up by a twenty-six (26) year old male named Coty Hoover at the Big Lots in Chester, Maryland. After picking up Jacoby, she was taken to Hoover&amp;rsquo;s residence in Biglerville, Pennsylvania. Troopers conducted a preliminary interview with Jacoby and she stated she met Coty Hoover online. Jacoby stated Coty Hoover was her boyfriend, however they did not engage in any sexual contact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s cell phone was seized by Trooper Pasquale per Corporal Donald&amp;rsquo;s request. Jacoby was then transported to the Gettysburg Barrack where she awaited the arrival of her father.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald made contact with Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County CPS to arrange a forensic interview.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On April 18, 2023, Corporal Donald made contact with Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s grandmother, Nancy Thompson. Nancy Thompson stated she spoke with Jacoby in reference to her interaction with Coty Hoover. According to Jacoby, she disclosed to Coty Hoover that she was 15-years-old via text message prior to meeting him in person on April 15, 2023. Nancy Thompson stated Jacoby met Coty Hoover on the MeetMe dating application and they have been talking for several months. According to Nancy Thompson, Coty Hoover advised Jacoby that he was 16-years-old.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald also received an email from Coty Hoover&amp;rsquo;s mother, Roxanne Hoover. Roxanne Hoover provided her phone number in the email and requested Corporal Donald to contact her at his earliest convenience. Shortly after, Corporal Donald made contact with Roxanne Hoover via telephone. During the conversation, Roxanne Hoover stated her son believed Jacoby was approximately 20-years-old. Roxanne Hoover stated her son drove to Maryland by himself and picked up Jacoby in his silver Ford Mustang. According to Roxanne Hoover, Coty Hoover engaged in sexual acts with Jacoby during her stay at their residence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On April 23, 2023, Taylor Thompson contacted Corporal Donald to report that her step-daughter, Lillian Jacoby, disclosed she was raped by a fellow student. Jacoby stated this occurred while attending Saturday school at Kent Island High School. Jacoby stated this was the reason why she ran away from her home on April 15, 2023. This investigation will be documented under case number 23-MSP-014647.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On April 26, 2023 at 1100 hours, Jacoby was interviewed by CPS Investigator Krystal Christ at the Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County Child Advocacy Center. During the interview, Jacoby made the following statements in sum and substance:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Jacoby has been talking to Coty Hoover for approximately one year via Facebook Messenger and Snapchat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Jacoby met Coty Hoover when he added her on Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Jacoby told Coty Hoover that she was in 9th grade. Jacoby stated Coty Hoover never disclosed his age during their conversations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Coty Hoover eventually suggested that they meet in person and hang out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Jacoby stated Coty Hoover was looking for a girlfriend, but she advised she wanted to remain friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Jacoby stated she contacted Coty Hoover after she was sexually assaulted at school and asked him to pick her up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Coty Hoover drove to Maryland in his Ford Mustang and picked her up from Big Lots in Chester, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Coty Hoover and Jacoby ate dinner at an unknown restaurant in what she believed to be Frederick, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;After dinner,&amp;nbsp; Coty Hoover took Jacoby to his parents home located at 4743 Chambersburg Road Biglerville, Pennsylvania 17307. Jacoby stated Coty lives with his mom, dad and sister.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Jacoby went for a walk with Coty Hoover in the woods. After the walk, Jacoby went back to Coty Hoover&amp;rsquo;s house and fell asleep on the couch. Jacoby stated she woke up in the morning and ate breakfast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;Jacoby went to Walmart with Coty Hoover on 4/16/2023.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Following the conclusion of the interview, Corporal Donald spoke with Jacoby&amp;rsquo;s stepmother, Taylor Thompson. Thompson provided written consent for Corporal Donald to manually preview the phone that was seized by the Pennsylvania State Police from Jacoby. Thompson identified this phone as her old iphone that she no longer used. Thompson stated Jacoby found this phone in their house and has been using it to access the internet and speak with Coty Hoover.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On April 27, 2023, Corporal Donald went to the Pennsylvania State Police Gettysburg Barrack and took possession of the iPhone. Corporal Donald unlocked the phone and began reviewing its contents.

Cotyakbear1997 also made the following statements during their conversation:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cotyakbear1997: How would you want it raw, or protection? I always have protection just incase but I wanna make sure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Cotyakbear1997: Hey babygirl. I miss you. Sometimes I think about how hot you&amp;rsquo;d look making my cock shiny while I slide it in and out of you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cotyakbear1997: We can carry it over to the shower for round 3 after I watch you cream on my cock a little from riding me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cotyakbear1997: Say that all you want in person I&amp;rsquo;d already have you bent over the bed shaking wet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cotyakbear1997: You could choke on me instead. Feeling your legs wrapped around me. Feeling how warm and wet you are with me inside you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cotyakbear1997: I&amp;rsquo;m really hoping there is enough room in my car for you to set in my lap.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald also located several nude image and video files of Jacoby that were sent to cotyakbear1997.
