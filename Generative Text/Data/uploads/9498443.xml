         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police North East Barrack.&lt;br /&gt; Marked patrol F-26 has an operable mobile recording device.&lt;br /&gt; Tpr. Jones #7445 has an operable body worn camera system.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Attachments: None.&lt;br /&gt; Scene Processing: None.&lt;br /&gt; Neighborhood Check: None.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 06/11/2023 at approximately 1626 hours, I, Trooper Jones #7445 of the Maryland State Police - North East Barrack was on duty and dispatched to 1190 Augustine Herman Hwy, Elkton, MD 21921 in reference to an assault that just occurred.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arrival, I was met by one of the employees at the location which I learned to be a woman&amp;#39;s shelter. I identified the employee to be Jaden Elizabeth Hamilton (W/F, DOB: 08/01/2002). Hamilton stated two of the residents had got into a physical altercation and had since been separated. Hamilton directed me inside the building where she advised the victim was located. I then made contact with Nicole Lynne Lorence (W/F, DOB: 06/26/1989). Lorence was sitting with her 2-month-old infant daughter and crying. I observed her left forearm to be bruised and swollen as well. I asked Lorence to explain what happened, and she stated she had a verbal altercation with her roommate because her roommate claimed Lorence was being disrespectful and taking about people behind their backs. Lorence then stated the argument continued, and she told her roommate she had no respect for the people in their room while they sleep. Lorence advised once she said that, her roommate became more upset and said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not afraid of you&amp;quot; followed by her striking Lorence with a closed fist approximately 10-15 times all over her body. During the time Lorence was explaining what occurred, she claimed that during the altercation, the suspect had possibly struck the baby while she was being assaulted. I then requested EMS personnel per her request to respond to our location to check on the infant and make sure she was in good health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While EMS was on thew way, I responded back outside to make contact with the suspect. I identified her as Natasha Marie Hawkins (W/F, DOB: 01/30/1988). I asked Hawkins if she could explain her side of the story at which point she began explaining that she was spraying disinfectant spray in their room due to her baby having the hand, foot, and mouth virus. Hawkins stated while she was doing that, Lorence became upset and told her she was spraying too much. After they yelled at each other for a few minutes, Hawkins stated she walked out of the room, shut the door, and seconds later, Lorence opened the door yelling and following Hawkins. As Lorence was following Hawkins, she passed her and allegedly bumped into Hawkins person. Hawkins stated at that point she had enough and began assaulting Lorence. When asked if she had ever intentionally or unintentionally struck the infant, Hawkins became more upset and advised there was absolutely no way the baby was ever harmed because Lorence had placed the baby down on the ground in the car seat she had the baby in and stepped multiple feet away from the child. I also asked Hawkins if she had any marks or bruises on her person or if she wanted EMS personnel to evaluate her while they were there. Hawkins stated she was not injured, but stated she had scratches on her face from Lorence. As I looked at Hawkins&amp;#39; face, I did not observe any obvious signs of injury.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After speaking with Hawkins, I was then informed that there was a witness to the altercation between Hawkins and Lorence. I was then directed to Desiree Lynn Biggar (W/F, DOB: 12/09/1986) who advised me she witnessed the entire altercation. Biggar stated she heard both females yelling at each other and walked over to see what was going on when she heard Lorence specifically state &amp;quot;what the fuck are you going to do about it?&amp;quot; At that point, Biggar stated she observed Hawkins then slap Lorence across the face and behind assaulting her several times until Lorence fell to the ground, and it was broken up by another person who walked in on the altercation. I asked Biggar if she saw where the infant was located during the fight, and she stated the baby was nowhere near Hawkins and Lorence because Lorence had placed the baby down on the ground in its car seat and was walking towards Hawkins. I asked Biggar if she saw the baby at any point get struck by either female during the altercation, and she advised there was no way it could have happened due to the location of where the baby was sat down at and where the fight occurred. It is also noted that EMS personnel on scene stated they completed their evaluation and determined the baby to have no apparent injuries.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon speaking with all parties involved, I provided both Hawkins and Lorence with a MSP 225 brochure with my name and the case number for this incident written on it. I advised both females if they wished to press charges against the other, they were to respond the Cecil County District Court Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office to apply for charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 06/24/2023 at approximately 1155 hours, I attempted to make contact with both Lorence and Hawkins to inquire if either person had gone to the Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office to file for charges. When I attempted to make contact with Lorence through the phone number she provided, I spoke with a female who yelled at me stating Lorence does not use the phone I was calling and to not call back again. I then attempted to contact Hawkins who I was also unable to get an answer from due to the message I received indicating that it had been disconnected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Case Status&lt;/strong&gt;: I request this case be listed as suspended due to the lack of victim prosecution.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
