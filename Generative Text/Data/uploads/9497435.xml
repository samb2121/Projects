         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 01/25/2023, I was contacted by case worker Kristina Hoffman from the Washington County Child Advocacy Center and advised of a new case.&amp;nbsp; While being seen at Wellspan Hospital in Chambersburg, PA Charlie Powell (D.O.B. 01/28/2010) reported that his father William Powell (W/M, D.O.B. 11/21/1965) touched his &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; (penis).&amp;nbsp; CW Hoffman noted she scheduled a forensic interview with Charlie on 02/03/2023, at 1200 hours, and requested that I attend the interview.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 01/25/2023, I responded to the Washington County Child Advocacy Center for the interview.&amp;nbsp; Prior to the interview, it was learned that two days ago Charlie&amp;#39;s mother, Sophia Smith (W/F, D.O.B. 11/10/1986) overheard Charlie telling his brother he told a lie and made up the story about his dad touching his &amp;quot;thing.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Captioned below are notes taken during the interview by CPS Supervisor Rachel Mazloum.&amp;nbsp; It is not a word for word transcript of the interview, for that please refer to the digital recording made of the interview that is stored at the Washington County Child Advocacy Center per their policies and procedures.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CPS worker Kris Hoffman interviewed Charles (age 13) using the ChildFirst Forensic Interviewing Protocol. The interview was video recorded. CPS Supervisor Rachel Mazloum and MSP Senior Trooper Darren Burleson observed the interview.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker started with rapport building and narrative practice. Charles was very soft spoken and did not elaborate a lot of detail initially when speaking with worker, but did answer questions asked. He talked about liking to watch golf on his Chrome Book and wanting to play golf. Worker provided an overview of the interview room and process and provided guidelines (tell the truth, don&amp;rsquo;t guess).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker introduced the topic of body safety and touches. Worker asked about touches he likes. He noted he likes high fives. He denied there being touches he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like. Worker presented the anatomically correct drawings. He labelled the penis as the &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo;, the female chest as the &amp;ldquo;nipple&amp;rdquo;, and the vagina as the &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He did not disclose anyone touching him in any sexual manner. He said he is &amp;ldquo;not okay&amp;rdquo; at school and he had a &amp;ldquo;tough day&amp;rdquo;. A girl at school, Nevaeh, asked him to be his boyfriend and he called her &amp;ldquo;baby cakes&amp;rdquo; and they broke up and now there is &amp;ldquo;drama&amp;rdquo; at school. He shared no other concerns at school. He talked about his brothers Alex and Conner and he loves both of them and plays with them. He lives with his mother, grandmother, and &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo;. Worker asked about his dad. He noted his dad gave him Pok&amp;eacute;mon cards and a Steeler&amp;rsquo;s football yesterday. He saw him at Charles&amp;rsquo; house. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually spend time with his dad because his dad has &amp;ldquo;cock roaches&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fleas&amp;rdquo;. He noted he doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel safe at his dad&amp;rsquo;s due to the cockroaches and fleas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker asked if anyone has ever touched him in a way that made him uncomfortable what he would do - he said he would tell his dad, mom, pappy, and nanny. He talked about the Mousetrap game.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Worker exited the interview room to speak to observers and then re-entered. Worker asked Charles if he ever had to tell his mom or dad about someone touching him in a way he didn&amp;rsquo;t like. He said he did tell them that his friend Nevaeh broke up with him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said he is grounded this weekend because he told a &amp;ldquo;lie&amp;rdquo;. He told a &amp;ldquo;lie&amp;rdquo; that his daddy touched him, but he told his brother Alex he didn&amp;rsquo;t. He reiterated to worker that his dad did not touch him. Worker asked why he said his daddy touched him, and he said it is because it reminds him of his friend Nevaeh. He said now he is grounded for two weeks. Worker asked what he told his mom, and he said &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rdquo;. Worker asked if anyone told him to say that his dad didn&amp;rsquo;t touch him, and he said no. Worker asked if dad has ever touched anybody else. Charles said &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s nice&amp;rdquo;, like his dad did yesterday when he gave him the football. Worker asked if they are ever alone together, and he said yes, and when worker asked what they do together, he said &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m with mom&amp;rdquo; and then said he and dad are never by themselves together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He talked about going to Brook Lane because he &amp;ldquo;choked&amp;rdquo; Conner. He said he was &amp;ldquo;jealous&amp;rdquo; of Conner because Conner didn&amp;rsquo;t get in time out and Charles did. His mom caught him choking Conner. He said Conner was hurt, but now he&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;fine&amp;rdquo;. Worker asked what made him stop choking Conner, and he said &amp;ldquo;because I got the help&amp;rdquo;. Worker asked if anyone has ever choked Charles, and he said no. The interview was ended after reverting to a neutral topic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Due to the above stated facts, I request this case be closed, unfounded.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All the above events occurred in Washington County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
