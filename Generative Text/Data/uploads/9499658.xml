         <NarrativeText>MSP marked vehicle N-36 is equipped with a mobile recording device&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Defendant: Chris Yoni St Jean&lt;br /&gt; Date of Birth: 08/31/1981&lt;br /&gt; Date of Arrest: 07/05/2023&lt;br /&gt; Time of Arrest: 0100 hours&lt;br /&gt; DUI #: 23-159&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;SUBSEQUENT OFFENDER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *Trained in administering standardized field sobriety tests through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;br /&gt; *Trained in administering advanced standardized field sobriety tests (ARIDE) through the Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;VEHICLE IN MOTION (PHASE 1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On July 5, 2023, at approximately 0029 hours, I, Trooper Lear (#7154), was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating marked MSP vehicle N-36 in Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland. I was traveling westbound on I-495 at Maryland Route-193 when I observed a black Acura TL struggling to maintain a single lane and traveling at a high rate of speed. I paced the Acura for three tenths of a mile at an equal distance and equal speed. The Acura was traveling 90 miles per hour in a 55 miles per hour zone. The Acura crossed into lane two from lane one by more than a tire&amp;#39;s width on three separate occasions. Traffic was light and no other vehicle forced the Acura to change lanes. I activated my emergency equipment and conducted a traffic stop on the Acura. The Acura was bearing NJ registration W45FVX.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL CONTACT (PHASE 2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I approached the Acura and made contact with the driver. When I made contact with the driver, I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. I immediately observed the driver&amp;#39;s eyes to be bloodshot and glassy with a glazed look. The driver was identified by his VA driver&amp;#39;s license as Chris Yoni St Jean (DOB: 08/31/1981, B/M). I asked St Jean if he consumed any alcoholic beverages that night. St Jean advised he consumed three Corona beers at his mother&amp;#39;s house in New Jersey around 1700 hours. I noticed St Jean mumbling his words when he would speak. I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks on St Jean. During my routine check of St Jean, I noticed that St Jean had one prior DUI in 2016 in New Jersey. I advised the Rockville Barrack that I would need a backup unit for standardized field sobriety tests. Trooper Yu #6690 arrived on scene. When I asked St Jean to exit the Acura, his body movements were slow and lethargic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PRE-ARREST SCREENING (PHASE 3)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The evaluation was performed in front of the Acura TL on the right shoulder of westbound I-495 at MD Rt. 97, Silver Spring, MD. The surface was dry, slight downhill grade, and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and approximately 75 degrees. Lighting conditions consisted of light illuminating from light poles and my patrol vehicle&amp;#39;s headlights. St Jean appeared to be in good physical condition and did not display any visible injuries that would prevent him from walking or standing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked St Jean the following questions:&lt;br /&gt; - Injuries &amp;ndash; No&lt;br /&gt; - Medication &amp;ndash; No&lt;br /&gt; - Medical Conditions &amp;ndash; No&lt;br /&gt; - Glasses/Contacts &amp;ndash; Yes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from St Jean&amp;rsquo;s person once he was outside of his Acura.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (6/6 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first test given was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. The tip of my pen was used as the stimulus and held approximately 12 to 15 inches from St Jean&amp;rsquo;s eyes. He was instructed to look straight ahead, keeping his head still while following and focusing on the tip of the stimulus with his eyes until told to stop. St Jean&amp;rsquo;s pupils were equal in size, showed equal tracking, and no resting Nystagmus was observed. He was positioned in a manner to ensure the headlights of passing traffic would not interfere with the test results. I asked St Jean if he understood the instructions and he stated, &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lack of Smooth Pursuit &amp;ndash; Present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation &amp;ndash; Present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; Onset of Nystagmus Prior to 45 degrees &amp;ndash; Present in both eyes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;WALK AND TURN (0/8 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Prior to St Jean performing the test, I properly examined and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. St Jean was instructed to place his right foot directly in front of his left foot and touch heel to toe. St Jean was instructed and demonstrated to place his hands flat at his sides and to remain in the position until told to begin. St Jean was advised to take nine (9) steps in a straight line touching heel to toe on every step. St Jean was to keep his hands flat at his side, keep his eyes focused on his feet, and count every step aloud. On the ninth step, St Jean was explained and demonstrated to keep his lead foot on the line and to take a series of small steps around with his rear foot to turn completely around. St Jean was again explained and demonstrated the second series of nine (9) steps were to be performed identically to the first series. St Jean was instructed that once he began the test that he was not to stop walking until the test was completed, keep his hands down by his side, look at his feet, and count each step out loud. I asked St Jean if he understood the test and he stated, &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; Footwear: sneakers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instructional Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -No clues observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Walking Stage (1st Nine):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -No clues observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Turn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Turn completed satisfactorily.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Walking Stage (2nd Nine):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -No clues observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ONE LEG STAND (0/4 clues observed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Prior to St Jean performing the test, I properly explained and demonstrated how the test should be conducted. St Jean was instructed to stand with his heels together and hands down by his sides while the instructions were given and during the test. When instructed to start, he was to raise the foot of his choice off the ground approximately 6 inches. While his leg was raised, he was to keep his leg straight, watch his raised foot, count out loud by thousands (one-thousand one, one-thousand two), and continue the test until told to stop. I asked St Jean if he understood the test and he stated, &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; St Jean chose to raise his right foot. Footwear: sneakers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instructional Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -No clues observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Balance and Count Stage:&lt;br /&gt; Seconds 0-10:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -No clues observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Seconds 11-20:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -No clues observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Seconds 21-30:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -No clues observed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Based on the following, I had reason to believe St Jean was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:&lt;br /&gt; -Failing to maintain a single lane direction on three separate occasions.&lt;br /&gt; -Traveling 90 miles per hour in a 55 miles per hour zone.&lt;br /&gt; -Prior DUI in 2016.&lt;br /&gt; -The strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.&lt;br /&gt; -Eyes were glassy and bloodshot with a glazed look.&lt;br /&gt; -Mumbled speech.&lt;br /&gt; -Body movements were slow and lethargic.&lt;br /&gt; -Admission to consuming three Corona beers at his mother&amp;rsquo;s house prior to driving.&lt;br /&gt; -Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus &amp;ndash; 6/6 clues observed&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I arrested St Jean for driving under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0100 hours. St Jean was placed in the front passenger seat of my patrol vehicle and transported to the Rockville Barrack for processing. After arriving at the barrack, I gave St Jean a copy of the DR-15 form in English to review while I played the entire form in English audio to him in the barrack. The English version audio can be found on mva.maryland.gov. St Jean signed the DR-15 at approximately 0132 hours, agreeing to submit to the intoximeter test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;20-MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I conducted the 20-minute observation period with St Jean beginning with his arrest. A preliminary search of St Jean was conducted on the scene and it revealed that he had nothing in his mouth. I observed St Jean from the time of the arrest until the time he submitted to the test and he did not put anything in his mouth. The test was conducted by Sgt. Tribue #5781 of the Maryland State Police on a certified instrument. St Jean&amp;rsquo;s breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of .09 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. St Jean was released to the custody of a friend, Joshua, from the barrack.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; CASE CLOSED BY ARREST.</NarrativeText>
