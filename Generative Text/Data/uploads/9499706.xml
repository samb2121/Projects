         <NarrativeText>Attachments:&lt;br /&gt; CC-DC-013 Petition for Emergency Evaluation&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Gun Center Forms&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Suspect:&lt;br /&gt; Krista Ellen Bonds, W/F, DOB 11/04/1969&lt;br /&gt; MD10272699800&lt;br /&gt; 31807 Beautiful Plains Rd NE, Little Orleans, MD 21766&lt;br /&gt; (301)331-1291&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Other contact person:&lt;br /&gt; Gene Long Wooth, W/M, DOB 12/04/1954&lt;br /&gt; 31807 Beautiful Plains Rd NE, Little Orleans, MD 21766&lt;br /&gt; (301)988-6920&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; On Saturday, August 5, 2023, at approximately 1126 hours I was dispatched to respond to 31807 Beautiful Plains Road NE, Little Orleans, MD 21766 for a check welfare.&amp;nbsp; The person of interest was Krista Ellen Bonds, W/F, DOB 11/04/1969 who had been reported by her son in Texas for unusual behavior from his mother, Krista.&amp;nbsp; According to the son, Krista sent him $1000.00 via Venmo and also all her personal account login and password information.&amp;nbsp; The son felt that this may be an indication that his mother may be contemplating suicide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I arrived on scene at approximately 1133 hours and made contact with Krista on the front porch of the residence.&amp;nbsp; While introducing herself, I could immediately smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath and person.&amp;nbsp; Krista had red, bloodshot eyes and was slurring her words while speaking.&amp;nbsp; While speaking with Krista, without provocation, she mentioned that she was okay and was not going to walk out into I-68 and get hit by a car.&amp;nbsp; Noticing that I-68 was approximately 100 yards from the front porch of her residence, I immediately became concerned.&amp;nbsp; During our conversation, Krista mentioned numerous times that she wanted to &amp;quot;quit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;walk away&amp;quot;, become &amp;quot;homeless&amp;quot; while tears ran down her face.&amp;nbsp; I attempted to source the cause of her feelings and Krista advised that her daughter that lives in Clearspring, MD stole a piece of furniture that belonged to her that was a family heirloom.&amp;nbsp; Krista advised that she was able to recover the item but was distraught her daughter would do such a thing.&amp;nbsp; Not being satisfied as that being the root cause of Krista&amp;#39;s feelings of loneliness and worthlessness I continued to speak with her.&amp;nbsp; Krista mentioned her ex-husband numerous times during the conversation.&amp;nbsp; I discovered that she divorced this person nearly thirty years ago, but during the course of their marriage, she was seriously victimized with numerous instances of domestic abuse.&amp;nbsp; Krista advised that she suffers from PTSD and alluded to the fact that she has a hard time repressing the bad memories that occurred during that time.&amp;nbsp; Krista also mentioned that her medical insurance through her work was problematic and there were issues with the premiums, dates and coverage for her most recent medical expenses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Krista advised that all of her children that she still had a good relationship with lived in other states.&amp;nbsp; Krista advised that all of her family were dead, and she did not have any friends.&amp;nbsp; Krista did not disclose that she lived with anyone else.&amp;nbsp; A short time passed, and a male subject pulled into the driveway on a motorcycle.&amp;nbsp; The male subject was identified as Gene Long Wooth, W/M, DOB 12/04/1954.&amp;nbsp; Wooth advised that Krista drinks alcohol heavily and experiences periods of depression and the feeling of worthiness.&amp;nbsp; During our brief conversation, Wooth advised that Krista is too far gone and did not believe medical intervention would assist her because of the severity of her mental status.&amp;nbsp; Krista maintained a calm composure during the entirety of the interaction I had with her.&amp;nbsp; Wooth did mention that he was willing to stay at the residence with her for the remainder of the day, but advised that he may need to go outside from periodically.&amp;nbsp; Based on the totality of the circumstances, I did not feel comfortable leaving Krista at her residence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Krista was transported to UPMC - Western Maryland without incident.&amp;nbsp; A Petition for Emergency Evaluation was completed.&amp;nbsp; The medical staff on duty at the hospital was briefed of Krista&amp;#39;s current condition and possible approaches to take when speaking with her in order to gain compliance without incident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The duty officer sent a Gun Center Firearm Check Request via faxed form, MSP 028.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MAFSS and DNR were negative for firearms or firearm related activities.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I respectfully request this case be closed.&lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Allegany County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
