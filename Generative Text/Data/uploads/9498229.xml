         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On Friday, January 20th, 2023, I responded to 335 Mount Zion Road in Swanton, Maryland, regarding a neighborhood dispute.&amp;nbsp; When I arrived I contacted and interviewed the complainant, Robert Eugene Johnson, who stated the following.&amp;nbsp; Approximately 2 month prior, which was estimated to have been in November or early December 2022, Mr. Johnson noticed that there was fluid puddled under his new John Deere compact tractor.&amp;nbsp; He contacted the John Deere dealership where the tractor was originally purchased and notified them of his findings.&amp;nbsp; The dealership dispatched a mechanic to his home to assess the defect.&amp;nbsp; According to Mr. Johnson, when the mechanic looked at the tractor he noted that many, if not all, of the hydraulic hoses couplings were loose, causing fluid to escape and puddle beneath the machine.&amp;nbsp; This seemed odd to him because the machine was so new.&amp;nbsp; He immediately assumed that someone must have loosened the couplings, intentionally.&amp;nbsp; After having the tractor fixed, Mr. Johnson set up security camera&amp;#39;s around his home, with one of the camera&amp;#39;s pointed toward the backyard where the tractor was parked under an aluminium tube, lightweight carport with a tarpaulin roof.&amp;nbsp; Mr. Johnson told me that one night he did see someone on his camera footage near the tractor, but the camera was positioned too far away to see who it was.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Mr. Johnson decided at that time he would begin parking his tractor directly in front of the entry door to his home, which is also in the view of a second camera.&amp;nbsp; Since that time he has had no issues or reasons to believe anyone has been tampering with his property.&amp;nbsp; On today&amp;#39;s date, January 20th, he and his friend went to Keyser, West Virginia.&amp;nbsp; When he returned home he noticed that the tarpaulin roofed carport, that was located to the rear of his home, was bent up and knocked over.&amp;nbsp; Mr. Johnson agreed that the wind most likely blew the structure over, but felt that someone could have loosened the fasteners that he used to anchor the columns of the shed to the ground.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I asked him who he would suspect of tampering with his tractor, as well as the fasteners to his carport.&amp;nbsp; Johnson told me he and his friend, Mark Duckworth, had a dispute over a woman they both were speaking to.&amp;nbsp; He believes that Mr. Duckworth could have been the person who loosened the fasteners.&amp;nbsp; Mr. Johnson voluntarily told me that he does not want anyone to get in trouble and does not want anyone charged, but did want the incident documented.&amp;nbsp; I asked him if he wanted me to speak with Mr. Duckworth, but he implied it may cause him more issues if I spoke to Mr. Duckworth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At Mr. Johnson&amp;#39;s request, this incident report was completed to document his concerns.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
