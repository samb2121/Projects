         <NarrativeText>BWC:&amp;nbsp;https://mdsp.evidence.com/axon/evidence?evidence_id=75776b1189cd4a6caafd22bd74cff6a2&amp;amp;partner_id=5ed6a168304e40eb9a0cfb1a226ef1a1&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Scene Processing: I conducted a general check of the residence to ensure that there were no obvious signs of forced entry.&amp;nbsp;Upon inspecting the rear door to Palmer&amp;#39;s residence, there appeared to be very minor damages to the door&amp;#39;s handle/frame. However, I could not determine whether the damages were from general use or actual forced entry.&amp;nbsp; No photographs were taken, due to lack of evidence or clear signs of break in.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On May 25th, 2023 at approximately 2054 hours I, Trooper Pilchard, responded to 209 Harford Road, Salisbury, Wicomico, MD, for a handgun reported stolen from the residence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon my arrival at the 209 Harford Road address, I met with the owner of the residence, identified as Harold Milton Palmer (W/M 09/27/1974) who advised he was the complainant. Palmer advised that he had been at work and after getting off work he had gone to the &amp;quot;Eagles Lodge&amp;quot;, where he is a member. Upon leaving the Eagles Lodge he returned to his residence, at which point he noticed his coin/change jar missing from his bedroom. After conducting an additional assessment of missing items, he also was unable to locate his Iver-Johnson .32 Revolver (Serial #: B10089). Palmer advised that the firearm was loaded at the time it was taken with six rounds of .32 ammunition. Palmer advised the change jar had an approximate value of $50 worth of change contained in it. Palmer did not provide an approximate value for the firearm, however, I was able to find an approximate value of $150.00 upon searching the firearm&amp;#39;s value.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then asked Palmer if he knew an approximate time that he last saw the firearm. Palmer advised he had seen it on May 24th, in his bedroom where he had left it. I then asked Palmer if he could give an approximate time he returned home and noticed the items missing. Palmer advised he returned home at approximately 2100 hours. Palmer also advised that he was allowing an acquaintance Quinn Purnell, later identified as Herman Lloyd Purnell (W/M 04/20/1986) to stay in his vehicle garage behind his home. Palmer advised that he believed Purnell was responsible for the burglary of his residence as he had been involved in thefts in the past and was currently just &amp;quot;bouncing around&amp;quot; looking for places to stay. Palmer advised that he had allowed Purnell to stay in exchange for helping him with certain tasks he may need assistance with. Palmer stated he had last seen Purnell that day, May 25th, when he returned home at approximately 1400 hours to take his roommate at 209 Harford Road to get her taxes done. He dropped her back off at the residence at approximately 1600 hours and didn&amp;#39;t return until after the Eagles Lodge at 2100 hours.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked Palmer if Purnell had access to the residence, to which he responded that he did not and that the back door was locked. I asked Palmer if he had checked his residence for forced entry. He stated that he had not, but we could go look. Upon inspecting the rear door to Palmer&amp;#39;s residence, there appeared to be very minor damages to the door&amp;#39;s handle/frame. However, I could not determine whether the damages were from general use or actual forced entry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Palmer then stated that he had called and told Purnell he was no longer welcome back at the residence, even to retrieve the few items he left. Palmer was able to provide a current phone number for Purnell while on scene. I then called the telephone number and was able to contact Purnell. Purnell provided his full name and date of birth as well as advising that he didn&amp;#39;t take the items in question. Purnell stated that Palmer was the only person who would still take him in and that he would never steal from him because of that.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Palmer was unable to provide the serial number for the firearm. A subsequent check of Palmer&amp;#39;s registered guns was then conducted and provided the necessary information for the firearm. The stolen firearm was entered into NCIC/Miles and associated NIC#G365995811.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case remain open, pending further investigation. All events occurred in Wicomico County, MD.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 05/31/2023 at approximately 1330 hours, I, TFC Todd 6929, was dispatched to 209 Harford Road and make contact with the original complainant, Harold Palmer, in reference to his handgun being recovered. I arrived and spoke to Palmer who showed me the handgun. It is an early model top break Iver-Johnson .32 revolver. After taking the grips off and scanning the entirety of the pistol I could not confirm a serial number, but Palmer advised this is the weapon that was stolen. He also advised that it was fully loaded when it was taken, and it is now unloaded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Palmer advised the firearm was located the day prior on 05/30 when he got off of work around 1700 and was not there when he left for work at 0900 that morning. I asked him why he took an entire day to report the gun being returned, and he stated he is starting a business and that he was busy with clients and calls and that he did not have the time. Palmer again told me that he knows &amp;quot;Quinn&amp;quot; or Hermon Purnell took it because he spoke to him shortly before Tpr Pilchard arrived the day before. Parlmer stated he told Quinn the State Police were coming to take a report, and although he denied taking it, sounded scared. Palmer also advised that Quinn would know to come when he is at work to put the pistol on the step. Palmer had no other information to give regarding Quinn taking the firearm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The firearm was removed from NCIC and Palmer was instructed to acquire a safe to safely store his firearms. He also advised that he would contact the State Police if Quinn attempted to come back to the property.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed due to the return of the stolen firearm.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Wicomico County&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TFC Todd 6929&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
