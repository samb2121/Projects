         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In car camera not equipped. Incident recorded on Maryland State Police body warn camera.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case: 23-MSP-012162&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Scene processing:&lt;br /&gt; A search incident to arrest of the vehicle was conducted. All evidence was collected and transported to Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for processing in accordance with MSP policy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Neighborhood check:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Due to the location and nature of the incident. A neighborhood check was not completed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On April 5,2023 at approximately 1518 hours, I, Trooper Tenney #7378, was on patrol northbound I-97 at Quarterfield Road , Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, Maryland when I observed a black BMW 328I displaying Maryland registration &amp;ldquo;5EW8982&amp;rdquo; driving northbound on I-97 with a broken passenger side taillight and admitting white light from the rear. &amp;nbsp;I conducted a traffic stop and made contact with the driver at the driver&amp;#39;s window. I identified myself, advised the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle he was being audio and video recorded, and advised the reason for the stop.&amp;nbsp;While attempting to locate his Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license Thompson began making fast furtive movements. Thompson checked behind the seat, in the center console, in the door pocket, and began reaching under his seat before partially opening the door to find his wallet and Identification. The driver of the vehicle provided me with his Maryland driver&amp;rsquo;s license which identified him as Dwayne Thompson (DOB:11/04/1994) and a registration card. The photograph on the Maryland driver&amp;rsquo;s licenses matched the likeness of the driver&amp;rsquo;s appearance. An MVA query was performed and revealed two possible active warrants through Baltimore City and Washington County for Firearm possession and Drug trafficking. I then contacted Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for warrant confirmation. A few minutes later, Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack advised me that the warrants are active and can be served in county.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Upon arrival of TFC Tenorio #6321, I asked Thompson to step out of the vehicle and speak with me at the rear of the BMW. Once out of the vehicle at the rear of the BMW, Thompson asked what was going on. &amp;nbsp;I informed Thompson that he was under arrest for an active warrant. I instructed Thompson to place the keys on the trunk of the vehicle. Thompson failed to comply with my instructions and began to resist arrest. A few moments later, as I gripped Thompson&amp;rsquo;s left arm with my left hand to place it behind his back, Thompson escaped my grasp pulled his left arm away. Thompson then turned left and began to flee into the median of I-97. With my left hand, I was able to grip his shirt and pull him back towards me. Thompson&amp;#39;s forward momentum pulled me forward for a short distance before I was able to execute a takedown maneuver and assist Thompson to the ground. Thompson continued to not comply with instructions to place his hands behind his back. After a few minutes, TFC Tenorio and I were able to place Thompson&amp;rsquo;s hands behind his back. TFC Tenorio and I then assisted Thompson to his feet and placed him inside my marked Maryland State Police vehicle P-18. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After I secured Thompson inside my marked MSP vehicle, I contacted MSP Glen Burnie Barrack and requested Emergency Medical Services to respond for a precautionary evaluation of Thompson. Thompson refused medical treatment on scene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A search incident to arrest was conducted of the vehicle and revealed a black semi-automatic Tisas PX-9 9 MM pistol, loaded with 1 round in the chamber. One 18 round magazine loaded with 6 rounds of 9MM ammunition was inserted in the firearm. After inspection of the firearm, I found that the serial number located on the lower frame appeared to be tampered with and was non-legible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thompson was then transported to the Maryland State Glen Burnie Barrack for processing. Thompson was read his Miranda Rights and agreed to answer questions. Upon arrival of M/Tpr. Ditoto with the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division, an interview was conducted prior to Thompson subsequent transport to Jennifer Road Detention Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thompson was issued all relevant paperwork before being transported to the Jennifer Road Detention Center in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The Maryland Gun Center was contacted and advised that Thompson is prohibited from owning a firearm and does not currently possess a Handgun Qualification License or a Conceal Carry Permit. Charges for firearm possession were recommended by the Maryland Gun Center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Close case by arrest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #1 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On Wednesday, April 5th, 2023 at approximately 1528 hours, I Tfc Tenorio #6321 was dispatched to assist &amp;quot;P-18&amp;quot; Tpr Tenney #7378, in the area of &amp;nbsp;North bound I 97 in the area of New Cut Rd Glen Burnie Anne, Arundel County, Maryland, in regard to a subject with a possible warrant out of Baltimore City. Upon my arrival I observed Tpr Tenney exit his vehicle and make contact with the subject.I was about 5 ft from Tpr Tenney at the time he made contact with the subject. I could partially here what was being said at the time of Tpr Tenney Contact with the subject,but was able to determine the subject was not complying with Tpr Tenney orders. Shortly after the subject exited his vehicle asking what was going on. Tpr Tenney would give the subject order to turn around and face his vehicle about 3-4 times. At this time due to subject&amp;#39;s reluctance to comply with Tpr Tenney &amp;nbsp;orders, I grabbed the subject right arm by the tricep. Tpr Tenney would then advised the subject he had a warrant. The subject would then pull away from me and attempt to flee us.Tpr Tenney was able to bring down the subject as I secured the subject&amp;#39;s hands by using my two hands around the subject&amp;#39;s wrist. Tpr Tenney would give the subject several more orders to turn around and put his hands behind his back. The subject would ask us several more times what is the warrant for and then i&amp;#39;ll put hands behind my back. Tpr Tenney would continue giving the subject more orders to comply and out his hands behind his back. I advised Tpr Tenney, I have both hands, I will pass you the top hand (left) first to get your handcuffs and secure that hand first. &amp;nbsp;I passed Tpr Tenney the subject left hand and he was able to secure it with one side of his handcuffs. Tpr Tenney and I were then able to maneuver the subject around to get access to his right hand and place it behind his back. The subject was secured without further incident. We then stood the subject up and placed him into P-18 and requested EMS to check on the subject for precautionary reasons. EMS arrived on scene and checked on the subject. The subject refused medical attention. At this time I learned of who the subject was Dwayne Thompson Jr. B/M D.O.B 11/04/1994. Thompson was then transported by Tpr Tenney to the Maryland State Police Glen Burnie Barrack for processing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Anne Arundel County, MD.</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On April 6, 2023 at approximately 1600 hours, Tpr Tenney #7378 conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle operated by Dwayne Thompson Jr (B/M, DOB:11/04/1994) of Nottingham, Maryland, on I-97 in Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp; A check through NCIC revealed Thompson had a warrant through Baltimore City for parole violation related to firearm and CDS charges and a warrant through Washington County for Failure to Appear (CDS Violations).&amp;nbsp; Upon attempting to arrest Thompson for the warrants he fled on foot, but was quickly apprehended.&amp;nbsp; A loaded Zigana PX9 9mm handgun with an unreadable serial number was located in the suspect&amp;rsquo;s vehicle.&amp;nbsp; A check of the Maryland gun center revealed no leads on the firearm without the serial number.&amp;nbsp; Thompson Jr was found to be prohibited from possessing firearms due to previous criminal convictions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I, S/T S. DiToto #5416 was contacted and briefed on the incident.&amp;nbsp; Tpr Tenney advised Thompson Jr was mirandized and willing to speak with investigators.&amp;nbsp; I responded to MSP Glen Burnie Barrack and conducted an interview.&amp;nbsp; During the interview, Thompson denied having knowledge of the active arrest warrants.&amp;nbsp; He did explain that after learning of the warrants he knew what cases they related to and explained the circumstances related.&amp;nbsp; Thompson Jr admitted to being involved in the use and distribution of CDS previously, but claimed no current involvement as he was working on getting his CDL and obtaining legitimate employment.&amp;nbsp; Thompson stated the firearm recovered from the vehicle is owned by his girlfriend Shenetra Poole.&amp;nbsp; Poole was the registered owner of the vehicle he was operating.&amp;nbsp; He stated he and Poole reside together with their children and both use the car.&amp;nbsp; Thomson stated several months earlier during some domestic issues, he had packed his belongings and other property in the car to move out.&amp;nbsp; He said ultimately, he did not move out and some items remained packed in the car.&amp;nbsp; Thompson said approximately two days prior to this incident he located the firearm while looking through a bag of clothing in the trunk and subsequently moved it to underneath the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat.&amp;nbsp; Thompson said he recognized the firearm to be Poole&amp;rsquo;s, but he had not advised her he located it.&amp;nbsp; Thompson advised Poole had previously reported the firearm stolen, because they were victims of a burglary at their residence and they could not locate the firearm.&amp;nbsp; Thompson stated he did not steal the firearm, Poole did not know he possessed the firearm or give it top him, and that Poole would not consider the firearm stolen when contacted.&amp;nbsp; At the conclusion of his interview, Thompson was asked about information related to Firearms and CDS offenses, but declined the provide information.&amp;nbsp; Thompson was provided with my contact information for future contact/cooperation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I contacted Shenetra Aniya Poole via telephone and confirmed her identifying information.&amp;nbsp; Poole stated she has a registered firearm and provided a description matching the seized firearm.&amp;nbsp; Poole stated she reported the firearm stolen when she and Thompson could not find it after a burglary and she provided a case number and police officer ID number for Baltimore County Police related to that report.&amp;nbsp; Poole provided a synopsis of events that correlated Thompson&amp;rsquo;s statement.&amp;nbsp; Poole stated know that she is aware of the location of her firearm, she no longer considered it stolen and she did not consider Thompson having the firearm in the vehicle to him having stolen it from her.&amp;nbsp; Poole advised the firearm was purchased for personal protection for her small business and for an armed security position she previously worked.&amp;nbsp; Poole stated she did not purchase the firearm for Thompson and she did not know it was in the vehicle or in his possession.&amp;nbsp; Poole was not familiar with any alteration, damage, or general wear to the serial number on the firearm.&amp;nbsp; Poole was advised of the status of the firearm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I contacted the Maryland Gun Center and with their assistance was able to locate the MAFFS record and NCIC Stolen Gun entry for a Zigana PX9 9mm handgun (S/N: T062021BM01499).&amp;nbsp; Based on the details provided this was suspected to be the firearm seized.&amp;nbsp; I physically examined the seized handgun and found the serial number plate on the bottom of the frame was faded and had abnormal wear, but the number was still partially visible.&amp;nbsp; When compared to the serial number located in MAFSS, the faded numbers were distinguishable and found to match.&amp;nbsp; Cpl Ricker of Glen Burnie Barrack also physically examined the serial number and reached the same conclusion.&amp;nbsp; The Gun Center case report was updated accordingly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No further leads developed and no further investigation required at this time.&amp;nbsp; If Thompson Jr elects to cooperate and a future date/time, a new case will be initiated to document such investigative efforts.&amp;nbsp; Case closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Above events occurred in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
