This female is identical to the female present in Files #3 and #4.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 3/30/23, TFC Cooke was notified by Lt. Michael Snyder of the Prince George&amp;rsquo;s County Police Department that the residence at 10009 Traverse Way, Fort Washington, MD 20744 was involved in a housefire on 3/18/23 and currently condemned. The occupants of the residence were identified and interviewed by the investigators with the Prince George&amp;rsquo;s County Office of the Fire Marshal. The occupants were identified as Jamboa Davis (1/F DoB: 10/18/72), Steve Smith (1/M DoB: 3/28/67), Danashia Ashe (1/F DoB: 5/10/2010), and Daquanze Ashe (1/M DoB: 12/11/94). Ashe was reported to have had possession of his cell phone during the interview. All occupants were reported to be temporarily residing at the Residence Inn, 1700 Ritchie Station Court, Capitol Heights, MD 20790 in Room 414.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p dir="ltr" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On 4/4/23, TFC Cooke conducted a ruse and spoke with the homeowner, Jamboa Davis, who advised that all former occupants of 10009 Traverse Way, including her &amp;ldquo;god-son&amp;rdquo; Daquanze Ashe, are currently living in room 414 of the Residence Inn.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 4/7/23, TFC Cooke authored a residential search warrant for&amp;nbsp;the Residence Inn (Room 414) at 1700 Ritchie Station Court, Capitol Heights, MD 20790 and a body search warrant of Daquanze Ashe which were judicially endorsed on the same day by a District Court Judge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; On 4/12/23 at 0830 hours, TFC Cooke and MD ICAC Task Force investigators executed the residential search warrant of the Residence Inn (Room 414) at 1700 Ritchie Station Court, Capitol Heights, MD 20790. Daquanze Antione Ashe (1/M 12/11/94) was located in the lobby of the Residence Inn where he was served with the search warrant of his body. One cell phone belonging to Ashe was seized from his body, a black Samsung cell phone. Multiple electronic devices located within Room 414, including one black USB thumbdrive, two white DataTraveler 4GB USB thumbdrives, one black HP USB thumbdrive, one black Samsung Galaxy S9+, and one black Asus laptop. All property was seized per MSP policy on Property Record P-344531 and submitted to the Digital Forensics Laboratory for examination.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ashe was read his Miranda Rights at 0850 hours to which he knowingly and voluntarily agreed to answer questions in an interview. The interview was audibly recorded. During the interview, Ashe admitted ownership of email account JinAshe007@gmail.com and to viewing three files on that account&amp;#39;s Google Drive which he believed were child pornography. Ashe explained that in approximately February of 2023 he received the notice from Google that he had lost access to his account Jinashe007@gmail.com. Ashe then admitted to observing three contraband thumbnail images located within the drive&amp;#39;s contents. Ashe initially denied having viewed any video files as they were only thumbnail images but later admitted that those respective files were videos which he watched. Ashe was able to describe the videos in detail and recognized them as child pornography. The contraband files that Ashe described were the same files reported in the initial Cybertip. Ashe advised that he was unaware of the files and denied having downloaded them. Ashe repeatedly said that he believed his email account was hacked and somebody else uploaded those files to his Google Drive. TFC Cooke asked how Ashe was capable of viewing files within his Google Drive after receiving notice from Google that he no longer had access to his account to which Ashe explained that he was able to access the contents of his Google Drive through Microsoft OneDrive. Ashe further explained that both Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive are linked through his email account, jinashe007@gmail.com.&amp;nbsp;Ashe denied having had any sexual or inappropriate contact with his 12 year-old sister, Danashia Ashe (1/F 5/10/2010). Ashe agreed to submit to a polygraph examination which was later administered at the Prince Frederick Barrack by Cpl. Fred Dolinger. Ashe&amp;#39;s polygraph results did not show signs of deception regarding sexual/inappropriate contact with Danashia.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ashe&amp;#39;s step-mother, Jamboa Davis (1/F 10/18/72), was also present within the hotel lobby and subsequently interviewed. Davis confirmed that her daughter, Danashia Ashe, was currently in school. Davis advised that she was unaware of any suspicious/illegal activity from Ashe. After privately speaking with her daughter, Davis advised that a forensic interview with the Prince George&amp;#39;s County Child Advocacy Center was not necessary.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Prince George&amp;#39;s County State&amp;#39;s Attorney&amp;#39;s Office was contacted regarding the case - charges are pending forensic analysis of Ashe&amp;#39;s devices.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Prince George&amp;#39;s County, MD.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case open.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
