         <NarrativeText>Maryland State Police North East Barrack.&lt;br /&gt; Marked patrol F-26 has an operable mobile recording device.&lt;br /&gt; Tpr. Jones #7445 has an operable body worn camera system.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Attachments: None.&lt;br /&gt; Scene Processing: None.&lt;br /&gt; Neighborhood Check: None.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 06/28/2023 at approximately 0930 hours, I, Tpr. Jones #7445 of the Maryland State Police - North East Barrack was on duty and dispatched to the North East Barrack located at 2433 Pulaski Highway, North East, MD 21901 in reference to a past sexual assault involving a minor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arrival, I made contact with the parents of the male child who I was able to identify as Laurence Shane Covey (W/M, DOB: 06/25/1975) and Jennifer Lynn Covey (W/F, DOB: 11/29/1975). I advised both parents that I was not able to speak with their son at the moment, but that I was going to take them into an interview room to speak about the incident. Once we entered the interview room, I advised both Laurence and Jennifer that I was going to be taking an initial report to get the basic information on what occurred.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then asked Laurence to advise what happened starting from the beginning. He stated his son was attending a wrestling camp at the West Nottingham Academy located at 1079 Firetower Rd, Colora, MD, 21917. He advised the name of the camp is Agoge Academy.&amp;nbsp; Laurence said the night before at approximately 2000 hours, he and his wife received a phone call from the coach of the camp who they identified as Demetrios Gourgoulianis. Jennifer advised she was the one who answered the phone and asked if her son who was identified as Shane Nicholas Covey (W/M, DOB: 05/21/2009) was alright. She stated the coach replied he was okay, but that an incident had occurred over an altercation involving a food order, and they needed to respond to the camp. When asked what occurred, Jennifer advised she was informed that there was an altercation over a mobile food order and that another child at the camp had grabbed her son&amp;#39;s testicles.&amp;nbsp;Gourgoulianis then stated once the assault occurred, Shane had come to him and reported it. Gourgoulianis also informed Jennifer that he had contacted Child Protective Services as well prior to contacting the Covey&amp;#39;s.&amp;nbsp; At that time, Jennifer stated she and her husband responded to the camp to make contact with their son and Gourgoulianis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arrival at the camp, Jennifer and Laurence advised they spoke with Shane who stated a boy in the camp who he could only identify by his first name as &amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; had blocked the doorway of one of the dorm rooms and was sexually assaulting him by grabbing his testicles every time he tried to leave the room. Jennifer and Laurence both stated Shane explained he had placed mobile food order with what Jennifer advised was possibly through the GrubHub app. Due to up charges on the order, Shane requested additional money from the other 2 boys in the room with him. Shane then informed his parents that the 2 other boys began arguing with Shane and not giving him the money needed for the order. As Shane attempted to leave the dorm room, Shane advised his parents that the one boy in the room that he identified as Dax stood in front of the door and did not allow Shane to exit. During the time Shane was attempting to get by Dax and leave the room, Shane stated Dax was intentionally grabbing his testicles while still not allowing him to exit. I then asked Jennifer if this was an ongoing thing between Dax and Shane, and she replied that Shane stated Dax had been bullying him the last few days since they got to the camp. I asked what type of bullying was occurring, and she advised that Dax was allegedly walking around in front of Shane completely nude, would rip open the shower curtain while Shane was showering, he took the soap from Shane while he was showering, and he also had taken Shane&amp;#39;s bath towel while Shane was showering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then asked Jennifer and Laurence if they had any additional information on Dax and his whereabouts since they informed me as they arrived to the camp to check on Shane, they observed both Dax and his father walking out to leave since Gourgoulianis kicked Dax out fo the camp immediately after the reported allegations were made. Jennifer then stated after they spoke with Shane, he had apparently asked to stay at the camp and finish it out since Dax was removed and the problem was no longer present. Jennifer and Laurence stated they made sure he was okay with staying and ultimately allowed him to continue the camp which they indicated ends this Sunday on 07/02/2023. When Jennifer got home, she advised there was a Facebook group created for the camp where the parents of the children had joined and communicated prior to the start of the camp. Jennifer advised when she saw Dax and his father walking out of the camp, she recognized his father from his Facebook profile in the group created for the wrestling camp. Jennifer then added she remembered the father saying in the group that he was staying at a cabin on base at the Aberdeen Proving Ground Military Base and offered to let others from out of state stay with him and his son if they needed a place. I then asked if she knew where Dax and his father were from, and she replied she believed they are from Utah and expressed their concern that since Dax was kicked out of the camp, his father may take Dax back home to Utah before investigators were able to speak with either of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The last question I asked both Jennifer and Laurence was if anyone else witnessed the assault. Jennifer advised again that inside the dorm room was Shane, Dax and one other boy who was unable to be identified at that time. Jennifer stated when she and her husband spoke with the Gourgoulianis, he informed them of another boy who was inside the room, but that he was back in his dorm room crying and extremely upset about the incident.&amp;nbsp;Gourgoulianis explained to both Jennifer and Laurence that the boy apparently had no idea that Dax was going to do those things to Shane and did not participate in the assault whatsoever other than being inside the room at the time it occurred. I asked Jennifer and Laurence if they were comfortable with that explanation from&amp;nbsp;Gourgoulianis, and they advised they believed the assault only concerned Dax and believed the other boy had no knowledge that he was going to do those things to Shane.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At that time, I explained to both Jennifer and Laurence that I would be completing a report based on the interview we had and that once the report was completed, a criminal investigator would be reaching out for a follow-up and taking over the investigation from there. I provided both parents with a Form 225 brochure with my information, the barracks information, and the case number for this incident written on the brochure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Cecil County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Case Status&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the nature of the crime, I respectfully request this case be forwarded to CED.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On 7/3/2023, Corporal Donald was assigned an investigation in reference to a sexual assault. Corporal Donald made contact with the complainant&amp;#39;s, identified as&amp;nbsp;Laurence Shane Covey (W/M, DOB: 06/25/1975) and Jennifer Lynn Covey (W/F, DOB: 11/29/1975) to obtain more information. During their conversation, it was determined that Laurence and Jennifer Covey would bring their son (Shane Nicholas Covey, W/M, DOB: 05/21/2009) into the Cecil County Child Advocacy Center for a forensic interview. Laurence and Jennifer Covey identified the suspect as Dax Christensen (W/M, DOB: 4/29/2007) and provided Corporal Donald with a screenshot of his fathers Facebook profile, &amp;quot;Paul Christensen.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Laurence and Jennifer Covey believe Dax is currently living with his father in Salt Lake City, Utah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Corporal Donald made arraignments with the Child Advocacy Center and scheduled the interview on 7/14/2023 at 1200 hours.&amp;nbsp;Furthermore, contact was made with CPS Supervisor Kristen Hahn. Hahn advised this case was screened out and closed on 6/27/2023, as no maltreatment was indicated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 7/14/2023, LMSW Brittany Lester conducted a forensic interview with Shane Covey at the Cecil County Child Advocacy Center. During the interview, Shane Covey made the following statements in sum and substance:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Shane Covey currently attends John Carroll High School in Harford County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Shane Covey stated he attended an overnight wrestling camp when another &amp;quot;kid&amp;quot; began touching him. The camp was overnight and lasted for 10 days.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Shane Covey stated the suspect&amp;#39;s name was &amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot;, who was from a different state, and was &amp;quot;really weird&amp;quot; and was touching people.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; would open Shane Covey&amp;#39;s shower curtains while showering and steal his soap and towel.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;There were 5 total adult coaches at the camp. Coaches weren&amp;#39;t&amp;nbsp;present during the shower incident. Shane Covey stated students were required to shower 3-4 times a day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; would stare at Shane Covey in the nude and scream while Covey was in the shower. &amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; would yell the &amp;quot;N-word&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;other bad words.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; would try to sit in Shane Covey&amp;#39;s lap in the dorm&amp;#39;s common area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;One evening, Shane Covey ordered Grubhub and &amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; corned Shane Covey in a room and locked the door. &amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; cornered Shane Covey and grabbed his &amp;quot;balls&amp;quot; with his hands. &amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; continued to grab Shane Covey and was touching his whole body while moaning. Shane Covey eventually pushed away &amp;quot;Dax.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Shane Covey stated he felt frozen during the incident and other students intervened on his behalf.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Shane Covey indicated &amp;quot;Dax&amp;quot; touched him outside his clothing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Shane Covey stated he has never been touched inappropriately on any other occasion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Interview was ended after approximately 22 minutes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 7/18/2023, Corporal Donald made contact with Demetrios Gourgoulianis to obtain Paul and Dax Christensen contact information, full name, address, and date of birth. A preliminary search of Paul Christensen through law enforcement databases yielded negative results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This case remains OPEN pending further investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
