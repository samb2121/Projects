         <NarrativeText>Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On May 16, 2023 at approximately 1530 hours, an individual reporting to be Peter Joseph John Tiernen telephoned the Maryland State Police Leonardtown Barrack from telephone number 240-334-2627.&amp;nbsp; Peter initially told the Emergency Dispatcher that answered his call that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), that he was &amp;quot;tired of this world,&amp;quot; and he wanted to speak to the Barrack&amp;#39;s former Chaplin, Monsignor Karl.&amp;nbsp; Peter would not provide his location, nor would he provide his date of birth to the Emergency Dispatcher.&amp;nbsp; When Peter believed he was not going to be put in contact with Monsignor Karl, he terminated the telephone call.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Cpl. R. Jackson #5561 called the telephone number back, and the call was answered by a man identified as Delonte.&amp;nbsp; Delonte put Peter back on the telephone with Cpl. Jackson.&amp;nbsp; Peter explained to Cpl. Jackson that he was in the military and worked as a US government contractor for over 40 years.&amp;nbsp; Peter stated he now suffers from PTSD, and he feels that his service to his country and sacrifices he has made are not appreciated.&amp;nbsp; Peter stated that, years ago when he was at his &amp;quot;absolute lowest,&amp;quot; he met and spoke with Monsignor Karl, who lifted his spirits by reminding him of his self-worth.&amp;nbsp; Cpl. Jackson told Peter that his service and sacrifice for his country are appreciated by those who understand commitment to, and love of, country.&amp;nbsp; Cpl. Jackson thanked Peter for his service and his sacrifice, and Peter stated, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s all I needed to hear.&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#39;t need to talk to Father Karl now.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;#39;s busy.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Cpl. Jackson asked Peter if he was considering hurting himself.&amp;nbsp; Peter said, &amp;quot;No, I&amp;#39;m not going to hurt myself or anybody.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Cpl. Jackson asked him whether he was contemplating suicide.&amp;nbsp; Peter stated, &amp;quot;No. I&amp;#39;m a Catholic.&amp;nbsp; I would never do that.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Peter then tried to end the conversation, but Cpl. Jackson managed to convince him to stay by the telephone and wait for a call from Monsignor Karl.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Monsignor Karl telephoned Peter and spoke with him for an extended period of time.&amp;nbsp; Monsignor Karl then telephoned Cpl. Jackson at the Leonardtown Barrack to inform Cpl. Jackson that, while Peter did not make any suicidal statements, he was clearly suffering from mental illness.&amp;nbsp; Monsignor Karl managed to extract Peter&amp;#39;s location from him.&amp;nbsp; Peter explained to Monsignor Karl that he was at the J-Mart, located in the Bowie Town Center, 15633 Emerald Way, Bowie, MD 20716, and the telephone number Peter was calling from was the J-Mart&amp;#39;s telephone number.&amp;nbsp; Monsignor Karl also learned that Delonte was the manager of the J-Mart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Cpl. Jackson, then, contacted the Bowie Police Department and requested they conduct a Welfare Check of Peter, providing them with the information that had been gathered.&amp;nbsp; The Bowie Policed Department contacted Cpl. Jackson approximately one (1) hour later to inform him that they were unable to locate Peter; however, they spoke to Delonte at length.&amp;nbsp; Delonte informed them that Peter frequents the J-Mart, and he talks to Delonte quite often and for extended periods of time.&amp;nbsp; Delonte stated that Peter seems to be a little quirky, but he has never had any reason to believe Peter is a danger to himself or others.&amp;nbsp; Delonte stated that Peter purchased a tin of tobacco and a toothbrush after using the store&amp;#39;s telephone, before going on his way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed with no further police action.</NarrativeText>
