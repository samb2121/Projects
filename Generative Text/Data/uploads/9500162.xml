Troopers knocked and announced their presence at the main entrance of the household and the door was answered by an adult female. Troopers made entry without incident and identified the suspect, WATSON, David J. (01/M DOB: 02/26/1985), as he exited the basement to the main entrance on command. All occupants were notified they were being audibly and visually recorded.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TFC Crowe and SGT Pitcher escorted WATSON to a nearby covert Maryland State Police vehicle for a voluntary interview. This interview was audibly and visually recorded on Body Worn Camera. WATSON was advised of his Miranda rights and consented to answering questions without the presence of an attorney. During the course of the interview, WATSON admitted to viewing, retaining, and distributing images and videos depicting child pornography. WATSON admitted to ownership of the email addresses and accounts reported in the associated CyberTips, as well as additional accounts. Before the end of the interview, WATSON revealed to Troopers that he had viewed and masturbated to images or videos depicting child pornography as recent as the night before. WATSON denied any sexual contact with juveniles, and agreed to a voluntary polygraph examination. Despite the admissions made by WATSON related to possessing and distributing child pornography, WATSON showed signs of deception when asked about passwords/PIN information utilized to access his cell phone.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; During the course of the search, Troopers seized numerous devices from WATSON&amp;#39;s residence, which were transported to the Criminal Enforcement Division Headquarters building and placed in temporary storage pending a full forensic examination. Occupants were provided with the proper paperwork related to the seized items and a copy of the warrant was left on scene. TFC Crowe provided WATSON with a voluntary transport to the Maryland State Police College Park Barrack for the polygraph examination. WATSON was released to SGT Mario Farfan for the voluntary polygraph examination with the understanding that WATSON was free to leave at anytime.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; That evening, TFC Crowe was notified that WATSON had disclosed that he walks around the house naked while his biological daughter (9 yo) and her half sister (13 yo) are present.&amp;nbsp; WATSON further disclosed that he allows both juvenile females to be nude in the household and has allowed them to view pornography. TFC Crowe reported the disclosures made by WATSON and necessary details related to the investigation to the Maryland Department of Social Services / Child Protective Services screening center. TFC Crowe also contacted the mother of both girls, Nakia Mitchell, to notify her of the investigation, and a safety plan was put in place.&amp;nbsp; Upon contact, TFC Crowe discovered Ms. Mitchell is an employee for the Prince George&amp;#39;s County Department of Social Services / Child Protective Services. Because Ms. Mitchell is an employee, the case was transferred to Charles County CPS for further investigation.&amp;nbsp; Forensic Interviews for both juvenile females are set to take place Friday, 10/13/2023 in Charles County.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Also, the same evening, TFC Crowe contacted Special Agents from Homeland Security Investigations, who were able to fast track forensic analysis of WATSON&amp;#39;s devices, with a focus on WATSON&amp;#39;s cell phone.&amp;nbsp; On 10/06/2023, the seized items were transported to the Baltimore Customs House for forensic analysis.&amp;nbsp; These items were returned on 10/12/2023.&amp;nbsp; At the time of this report, analysis of the devices is still underway.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; OPEN / PENDING FORENSIC ANALYSIS</NarrativeText>
