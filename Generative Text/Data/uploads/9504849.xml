         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp;*Incident was captured on In-Car Camera and Body-Worn Camera.*&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; David Michael Hamilton&lt;br /&gt; W/M DOB: 9/4/68&lt;br /&gt; 7279 Steinsburg Rd.,&lt;br /&gt; Coopersburg, PA 18036&lt;br /&gt; Soundex #33894910&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; VEHICLE IN MOTION:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 8/23/23 at approximately 0807 Hrs, I TFC Koontz #6667 was dispatched to a single vehicle accident involving a silver Subaru SUV crashing into a guardrail located on I68 at the 77 mile marker. There were no other vehicles involved, and the suspect vehicle drove off the left side of the roadway and destroyed approximately 50 feet of guardrail.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PERSONAL CONTACT:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When I arrived on scene, I made contact with the driver and sole occupant of the Subaru, identified by his PA driver&amp;#39;s license as David Michael Hamilton (W/M DOB:9/4/68). Hamilton was sitting on the damaged guardrail as the tow operator worked at getting the disabled Subaru out of lane one of Interstate 68. I asked Hamilton what happened, and I immediately observed Hamilton was slurring his words and his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. I detected the strong odor of acholic beverage coming from Hamilton&amp;#39;s breath and person. Hamilton answered that he &amp;quot;had no idea&amp;quot;. I asked Hamilton what he had to drink prior to driving. Hamilton said he had nothing prior to driving. Hamilton tried to explain that he had spilled alcohol in his vehicle two days prior and that is why I was smelling the odor of acholic beverage. I told Hamilton that I had not yet been to his vehicle, and it was approximately 40 feet away from me, and I could not be smelling alcohol from inside his vehicle. Hamilton then admitted that he had consumed shots of vodka prior to driving.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I asked Hamilton to perform a Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) to which Hamilton agreed. The test was performed on the shoulder of I68 in front of my patrol vehicle. Hamilton displayed the following clues.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PRE-ARREST SCREENING:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS (HGN): 6/6&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The first test that was performed was the HGN test. I first explained the test to Hamilton. I used my pen as a stimulus. I advised Hamilton to keep his head still and follow the tip of the pen with only his eyes. I held the pen approximately 12-15 inches from his nose and slightly above eye level. Prior to the start of the test I am looking for resting nystagmus, equal pupil size, and equal tracking. I observed equal pupil size and equal tracking. I first checked for lack of smooth pursuit starting with the left eye then the right eye. Lack of smooth pursuit was observed in both eyes. Next, I checked for distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I first started with the left eye and then checked the right eye, holding each eye at maximum deviation for approximately four seconds. I observed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes during this test. Next I checked for the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees, starting with the left eye and then the right eye. I observed onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes during this test. All tests were completed two times to ensure reliability. I observed 6/6 clues for this test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NINE STEP WALK AND TURN (W&amp;amp;T): 7/8&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The second test that was performed was the W&amp;amp;T. This test was performed on a dry, flat, asphalt ground that was free of debris. I observed Hamilton was wearing sandals. I advised Hamilton to place the left foot on the ground and place the right foot directly in front, heel to toe with the left foot, place his arms down by his sides and not move until I was finished demonstrating the test. Hamilton struggled to place himself in the instruction stance. As I was finished demonstrating the test for Hamilton, he failed to stay in the instructional stance. Hamilton stated that he understood and began the test.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On the first set of nine steps, I observed Hamilton exhibit the following clues: Starts test too soon, Steps off-line, Doesn&amp;rsquo;t touch heel to toe by a distance greater than a half inch, Stops test, Raises his arms greater than six inches from his sides in an attempt to balance himself and Completed an improper number of steps by only taking the first 9 steps.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On the second set of nine steps, Hamilton did not attempt the second set of 9 steps. I observed 7/8 clues for this test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ONE LEG STAND (OLS): 3/4&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The third test I had Hamilton perform was the OLS test. I explained/demonstrated the test for Hamilton. I advised Hamilton that he was to raise whichever foot he wished to raise. I advised Hamilton that he was to raise his foot approximately six inches from the ground, keeping the bottom of his foot parallel to the ground, keeping both legs straight. I further instructed Hamilton that he was to keep his arms down by his sides, look at his foot for the duration of the test, and count out loud until I advised him to stop. Hamilton stated that he understood the instructions and began the test. I observed Hamilton raise his right foot as he began the test. I observed Hamilton display the following clue: Puts his foot down, Raises his arms greater than six inches from his sides in attempt to balance himself, Begins to sway. I observed 3/4 clues for this test. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Due to the above stated facts, clues observed, and totality of the circumstances, Hamilton was placed under arrest and placed in the front right seat of my patrol vehicle per MSP policy.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hamilton was transported to the MSP Hagerstown Barrack, Hagerstown, Washington County, Maryland for processing.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At approximately 0933 Hrs, Hamilton was advised of his Advice of Rights (DR-15) where he refused to submit to the breath test.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hamilton was then issued the proper citations and transported to the Washington County Detention Center for processing, due to the fact no one could respond to pick him up at the Hagerstown Barrack.&lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Washington County Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; Case CLOSED by arrest.</NarrativeText>
