Shubert and their counts were verified by Sgt Harper #1464 of the Berlin Barrack. The evidence was secured into the Barrack temporary storage locker. The evidence will be available until trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Narrative:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On April 4, 2023, at approximately 2328 hours, Trooper First Class C. Shubert #7062 with the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack responded to 12747 Old Bridge Road, Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland for a report of a stabbing victim on scene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to my arrival TFC Phillips arrived on-scene and attempted to locate the suspect but was unable to due to the suspect leaving the area prior to his arrival. While TFC Phillips was attempting to locate the suspect he located a black pocket knife located on the bottom step near where the suspect had walked to leave the property.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I arrived on-scene and made contact with the manager of Diakonia identified as Bonnie Michelle Daniels through her Maryland license. Daniels advised the victim later identified as Victor Sahib Muhammad through his Maryland license had been stabbed in the back. Muhammad was in the front office and was unable to move due to the blood coming from the wound. I observed other staff members applying pressure with a towel to Muhammad&amp;rsquo;s middle part of his back. Ocean City EMS responded to the scene and transported Muhammad to Tidal Health hospital. The Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack advised the suspect who stabbed Muhammad was identified as Lewis Edward Wilgus. CID was notified and TFC Mingos responded to Tidal Health to speak with Muhammad. The knife located on the bottom step was seized and packaged under property control # P-338191. I looked at the Surveillance footage but due to numerous cameras being inoperable I was unable to see the suspect leave the premises. I spoke to two of Wilgus&amp;#39;s roommates, and they advised Wilgus walked into the room in a rush and left. One roommate advised all he saw in Wilgus&amp;#39;s hand was a ball cap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;TFC Pinto #7212, TFC Phillips #7211, Sgt Walls #3805, Worcester County Sheriffs Office conducting patrol checks in the area attempting to locate the suspect. While Muhammad was in the ambulance he received a call advising Wilgus was wearing a red jacket trying to get into a taxi to go to Salisbury. The caller advised him Wilgus was near the Rambler located at 9812 Elm St, Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland 21842. &amp;nbsp;At approximately 0003 hours Wigus was arrested. While TFC Phillips was searching Wilgus prior to placing him in his patrol vehicle he located a maroon bag containing twenty-eight (28) grams of raw Marijuana that was seized and packaged under property control # P-338190. Wilgus was transported to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for processing.&amp;nbsp; Later Wilgus spoke to the Ocean City Commissioner&amp;#39;s office via phone call and was held without bond, and he was later transported to the Worcester County detention center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I request this case to be closed by arrest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 04/4/23 at 2332 hours, I, TFC Phillips, responded to Diakonia located at 12747 Old Bridge Road, Ocean City for a reported stabbing. Upon arrival, I contacted a worker who claimed the suspect responsible was in the men&amp;#39;s wing located on the second story of the back building. A Worcester County Deputy and I cleared the second story looking for the suspect. The suspect was not located, but several men advised that a man in his 60s wearing all black had come in and ran back out. While exiting the second story, a black switch-blade was located on the steps of the men&amp;#39;s wing. The scene was secured, and I left the area to attempt to locate the suspect. The Berlin Barrack then broadcasted that the suspect was on Elm Street near the Rambler motel. I responded to the area along with several other allied law enforcement. The suspect was located by several Worcester County Deputies, TFC Pinto, and SGT Walls. When I arrived on the scene Lewis Wilgis was seated handcuffed on the ground. He did not appear to be injured. A maroon zip up bag containing 28 grams of Marijuana was located on his person. He was searched for any weapons and then transported to my patrol vehicle V-30. He was transported to the Berlin Barrack without incident. Wilgis continued to fall asleep while in custody, he denied needing any medical attention several times. I assisted in processing the marijuana and watching over Wilgis while awaiting CED. I used no force in this incident nor did I witness force being used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events did occur in Worcester County, MD.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Supplement #2 Narrative</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 4/4/2023 at approximately 2340 hours, I responded to Diakonia located at 12745 Old Bridge Rd. Ocean City, MD 21842 to assist with a stabbing that had occurred. Once on location I contacted TFC. C. Shubert and inquired if he needed assistance at his location or if he wanted me to search the area for the suspect. The suspect was identified by name and description from the victim, prior to my arrival. The suspect was identified as Lewis Edward Wilgis. The victim of the stabbing was already being transported to the hospital and I requested that TFC Pinto respond to the hospital to contact the victim. While speaking with TFC C. Shubert, the Berlin Barrack advised that they received a phone call from the victim who advised that someone contacted him on his cell phone, either text or call, while he was in the ambulance, with the current location and description of the suspect. The Berlin Barrack advised that the victim stated the suspect was currently located at the Rambler Motel, which is approximately .4 miles and within walking distance from the scene of the assault. The Berlin Barrack advised that the victim added that the suspect was currently wearing a red jacket and a &amp;quot;durag.&amp;quot; I then left the Diakonia and drove to the Rambler Motel. Upon arrival, I observed several officers standing in front of a staircase and heard several commands ordering a subject to get on the ground. I then ran to the location and observed a subject matching the description of the suspect sitting on the bottom few steps of a flight of steps. I heard more commands from officers ordering the suspect to show them his hands and get on the ground. With the suspect moving very slowly, he was finally getting off the steps and began getting on the ground. As I approached the suspect was on the ground on all fours, but refusing to get all the way down on the ground as ordered. I then walked up behind the suspect and grabbed his right arm using a muscling technique and placed it behind his back, I then grabbed his left arm and using a muscling technique placed that arm behind his back as well. I then placed the suspect all the way on the ground, so he could be handcuffed. While holding his arms, another officer handcuffed the suspect at which point I let go and disengaged from the suspect. Due to the nature of the crime and the orders given by other Officers to get on the ground, I determined this was the safest way for the suspect to be detained, as he would have to get off the ground and potentially became a bigger threat if he was detained any other way. The suspect was then patted down and placed into a sitting position. The suspect&amp;#39;s ID was retrieved which identified him as the same suspect that the victim named, who had stabbed him. The suspect was subsequently transported to the Berlin Barrack for processing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Sitting on the steps with the suspect as we approached him was Leslie Cropper. Cropper advised that she observed the suspect walking from behind the houses across the street from the Rambler Motel.&amp;nbsp; She stated that she had no idea what happened and was not present during the assault. She stated that Wilgis asked her to stay with him, and was not sure why. She subsequently identified the area where she observed him walking from, that area was searched by multiple Officers in an attempt to locate evidence from the assault, with negative results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Ocean City Police Department Sgt. Bushnell was on location and assisting with an area search for evidence.&amp;nbsp; While searching the area, he made contact with Michael Moshili.&amp;nbsp; Moshili advised that he was sitting in his vehicle in front of his residence on Elm St, a short distance away from where the suspect was located. Moshili advised that he observed a subject matching the suspect description walking from behind his residence. Sgt. Bushnell advised that he walked that area and observed a dry pair of black and gray pajama pants sitting on the ground behind a residence on Old Bridge Road. This residence was behind and in the immediate vicinity of Moshili&amp;#39;s residence on Elm St., as Moshili&amp;#39;s residence sits on the corner of Elm St. and Old Bridge Rd. This residence was also in the walking path of where Moshili observed the suspect walking from. Along with the pajama pants a small canvas bag with a gold padlock was located. Contact was then made with the resident of where the property was located. (The residence had no visible numbers to identify an address, the resident advised the truck in the driveway belonged to his friend and the resident refused to provide any identifiable information other than his first name of Austin and phone number.) Austin advised that the pajama pants and bag did not belong to anyone in the residence. The items located and conversation with Austin were captured on body worn camera. The items were subsequently determined to be abandoned and seized as possibly belonging to the suspect. The area around where the above items were located was searched for additional evidence with negative results. The items were bagged, placed into my locked patrol vehicle and subsequently brought to the Berlin Barrack for processing.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;All of the above events occurred in Worcester County, MD.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On April 4, 2023, at approximately 2328 hours, I, Tfc. Pinto #7212 responded to 12747 Old Bridge Road, Ocean City, Worcester County, Maryland for a report of an assault with a knife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon my arrival, I was dispatched to search the area for the suspect who left the scene. I was advised the suspect was Lewis Wilgus. He was described as a white male, 61 years old, wearing all black, and is possibly armed with a knife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While searching the area, I was notified by the barrack that the victim received a phone call while en route to the hospital that the suspect was in the area of the Rambler Motel, located at 9942 Elm Street, Ocean City, Maryland, waiting for a taxi to pick him up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this time, I responded to the area of the Rambler and searched the area. While searching the area, Worcester County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Deputy Kenji advised he located the suspect next to the Rambler. I responded to Deputy Kenji and I observed he had his duty weapon pointed at the suspect, who was sitting on step with a black female. The suspect was wearing a red shirt, blue jeans, and a black skull cap. I remained to the left behind Deputy Kenji and drew my duty weapon with my right hand, keeping it by my duty holster pointed towards the ground. Deputy Kenji gave verbal commands for the suspect to get to the ground. At this time, the suspect got on his hands and knees with his torso still off the ground.&amp;nbsp; Deputy Kenji and myself gave verbal commands to the suspect to get all the way down on the ground and the suspect remained on his hands and knees with his torso still off the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I then observed Sergeant Walls, from the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack, walk around from behind the steps. Where the suspect was previously seated. Sergeant Walls grabbed the suspects&amp;#39; right wrist with his right hand, placed his left hand on the suspects&amp;#39; shoulder blade, and forced the suspects right hand behind his lower back. Sergeant Walls then grabbed the suspects&amp;#39; left forearm with his right hand and forced his left hand to his lower back. I then observed Sergeant Walls lift the suspect&amp;#39;s left and right arm away from his lower back. Sergeant Walls lifted the suspects left arm around his left wrist and his right arm around the suspect&amp;#39;s right wrist in an attempt for the suspect to lay flat on the ground. I observed the suspects&amp;#39; body shift forward when Sergeant Walls lifted both his wrists away from his lower back. I then observed Sergeant Walls place his right knee on the suspects&amp;#39; mid back. Sergeant Walls used his left hand around the suspect&amp;#39;s left wrist and his right hand around the suspects right wrist at his lower back, pushed downward with his knee and arms. The suspects&amp;#39; front torso was on the ground with his knees still underneath his stomach. Sergeant Walls then held the suspects&amp;#39; forearms at his lower back using his left hand on his left forearm and his right hand on his right forearm. The suspect was then handcuffed by Worcester County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Deputies on scene. Once the suspect was in custody he was searched while he was on the ground by the Deputies. While the suspect was being searched, I observed he had a marron handbag located in his front waistband.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the suspect was searched while on the ground, he was helped to his feet by Sergeant Walls. Sergeant Walls and I both continued searching the suspect. While searching the suspect, I located a black wallet located in his back-left pocket, and the suspect&amp;rsquo;s Maryland Identification card was located inside the wallet. The suspect was identified by his Maryland Identification card as Lewis Edward Wilgis (W/M 12/24/1961).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once the suspect was in custody, I was dispatched to respond to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Hospital, located at 100 E Carroll Street, Salisbury, Maryland, to make contact/ interview the victim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon my arrival at the hospital, I made contact with Victor Sahib Muhammad 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; (B/M 07/13/1988), who was identified by his name and date of birth. I asked Muhammad what happened this evening and he stated that Wilgus took his laptop. Muhammad then advised that Wilgus just needs alcohol treatment. Muhammad stated that Wilgus&amp;#39; roommate Burk was in the hallway, and he asked Burk that he wanted to talk to Wilgus and be civil. Muhammad advised that Burk then went into his room. Muhammad knocked on the door and Burk opened the door to his room. That is when Wilgus jumped straight up and stabbed him. Muhammad stated that Wilgus didn&amp;rsquo;t talk and just got straight up when he walked into the room and stabbed him. Muhammad advised he could feel where Wilgus stabbed him and felt the blood running down. Muhammad stated he then went to the front office to get help. Muhammad advised it was chaotic with Wilgus all day. Muhammad stated it started with a promissory note with a business agreement and that Wilgus wanted to use finances how they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be utilized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I asked Muhammad if Wilgus stabbed him over at Diakonia and he stated yes. I asked Muhammad which building the incident occurred in and he advised in the secondary building behind the main building. I asked Muhammad which room he is in the secondary building and he stated he sleeps in the hall. I asked Muhammad if that is where the stabbing happened and he advised it happened in Wilgus&amp;rsquo; room. I asked Muhammad if he stays upstairs in the hallway and Wilgus stays downstairs. Muhammad stated that they both stay upstairs, and that Wilgus sleeps in a room while he sleeps in the hallway. Muhammad then stated that Wilgus took the laptop, he went to ask Wilgus for the laptop back, and Wilgus jumped up and stabbed him. Muhammed then explained he knew the laptop was gone for approximately 40 minutes. Instead of confronting him for it right away, Muhammad stepped outside to have a cool mind and not be angry before returning and asking for the laptop back. Muhammad advised he then came back into the secondary Diakonia building. He saw Wilgus&amp;rsquo; roommate Burk in the hallway coming from the bathroom. He told Burk he wanted to talk to Wilgus civilly. Muhammad advised he then followed Burk to his and Wilgus room and upon entering the room Wilgus jumped up and stabbed him. I asked Muhammad what Wigus stabbed him with and he stated a knife. I asked Muhammad if he saw the knife and he stated he barely saw the knife. It was dark, that he would be lying if he said he saw the entire knife but that he knew it was a switch blade. He observed Wilgus flick his wrist to open the knife before stabbing him. I asked Muhammad what color the knife was and he stated he knew the blade was silver but that he didn&amp;rsquo;t see what color the handle was. I asked Muhammad what size he thinks the blade of the knife was and he advised probably the size of his pointer finger. I asked Muhammad where Wilgus stabbed him and he stated in his shoulder blade. I asked Muhammad which shoulder blade and he advised his left. &amp;nbsp;I asked Muhammad if I could see his stab wound and he leaned forward to show me the wound. Looking at the wound, I observed it to be approximately one inch long and had staples in it from the medical treatment he received at the hospital. I asked Muhammad what he did after Wilgus stabbed him and he advised he went straight to the main house and told them to call an ambulance. I asked Muhammad if he has ever had any issues with Wilgus in the past and he stated they just have had some disagreements but it had never been anything to this serious. I asked Muhammad if him and Wigus work together. He advised Wilgus came to him for help to get his daughter back, and became partners in a computer/ phone unlocking business. I asked Muhammad if he witnessed Wilgus drinking alcoholic beverages that evening and he stated earlier in the day he heard from roommates that Wilgus and his girlfriend were drinking alcoholic beverages in Ocean City.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this time, TFC Mingos, from the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division arrived on scene and took over the investigation and interviewed Muhammad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Worcester County and Wicomico County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

Muhammad advised Troopers he resides at Diakonia and was stabbed by another resident identified as Lewis Edward Wilgis (DOB: 12/24/1961), hereinafter referred to as Wilgis. EMS arrived on scene shortly after and transported Muhammad to Tidal Health Hospital in Salisbury, MD to be treated from a single stab wound located on the back-left shoulder blade area. Wilgis had fled the scene prior to Troopers arrival.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Due to the nature of the crime, the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region (CEDER) investigators were contacted to respond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I, TFC Mingos with CEDER, first arrived at Tidal Health located at 100 E Carroll Street, Salisbury, MD 21801 to interview Muhammad. The interview was conducted on April 5, at 0108 hours in the Emergency Department. The following interview is detailed below:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Interview- Victor Sahib Muhammad 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; (DOB: 07/13/1988):&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad Resides at homeless shelter identified as Diakonia located at 12745 Old Bridge Rd, Ocean City, MD 21842. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad advised he, Lewis Wilgis (aka Nick) took Muhammad&amp;rsquo;s laptop without his permission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he has been a resident at Diakonia for approximately 3 months and has known Wilgis for approximately 2 months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he sleeps in the hallway and Wilgis sleeps at the end of the hall, about six doors down from where Muhammad sleeps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad sated he walks outside the building to cool off for approximately 40 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated when he was outside, another resident identified as &amp;ldquo;Bert&amp;rdquo; (AKA country), comes outside to see him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he has known Bert for approximately 2 months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he went back inside with Bert to have a civilized conversation with Wilgis, and they walked down the hallway towards Wilgis room which was identified as room 3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Bert saw the altercation, but he would most likely not talk to the police. (this was verified by Troopers at the crime scene. Everybody interviewed advised they did not see the altercation take place).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated the rooms are very small and Wilgis was sitting on the bed when Muhammad was standing in the doorway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis was on the bed, in front of the doorway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis was &amp;ldquo;ranting and raving&amp;rdquo; in his bedroom when he arrived in the doorway and Muhammad did not have a chance to say anything before he was stabbed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis jumped towards him and they were face to face and Wilgis managed to stab him in the back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he knows Wilgis was drinking and he knows in the past if he is drinking then he stays away from Wilgis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he could smell the odor of alcohol coming from Wilgis breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated there is no other circumstances leading up to this event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I asked Muhammad if Wilgis has borrowed his laptop before and Muhammad stated he has already given Wilgis his old laptop (different one) before this incident happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated it is the liquor (alcohol) that makes him act this way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he recalls the blade being silver and it was about as long as his index finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated there was a reading lamp that was illuminated in the room during the attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he told Wilgis after her was stabbed, &amp;ldquo;that was some bitch ass shit for stabbing me.&amp;rdquo; And Wilgis walked out of the main house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated after he was stabbed, he could tell by Wilgis face that, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;#39;s not him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis was wearing pajama pants which he believes were red and gray.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad could not remember what shirt Wilgis was wearing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he believes Wilgis carries a blue and white backpack and believes one zipper has a lock on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he is trying to build a business with Wilgis and they are having issues with how the money is supposed to be spent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis is spending the money from the business on girls that he knows rather than putting it back in the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis said he would buy the software for the business and Muhammad would pay him back double.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis is with a female that he does not approve of because he is spending business money on her instead of the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated that he would like Wilgis to get treatment for his alcohol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated he was stabbed once, he stopped, and did not continue any other use of force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li style="margin-left:8px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muhammad stated Wilgis stabbed him and left the building and Wilgis did not chase after him or anything after the incident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of interview_________________________________________________________________&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I observed Muhammad&amp;#39;s injury to his back and it appeared to be one abrasion which was sealed by 3 staples by medical personnel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; During the interview, I was advised by the Maryland State Police Berlin Barracks that Wilgis was located and arrested a few blocks down from Diakonia. Wilgis was brought to the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack for questioning and processing. During Wilgis&amp;rsquo;s apprehension, a pair of pajamas matching the description were located on a porch in the vicinity of Wilgis. A detailed report will be conducted by the Trooper who apprehended Wilgis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Troopers from the Berlin barrack advised they observed a knife on the stairwell in the Diakonia building matching the description Muhammad provided me. The knife was seized and processed accordingly. A detailed report will be conducted by the Trooper who conducted this initial report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I sat down with Wilgis and advised him of his Advice of Miranda Rights. Wilgis requested a lawyer before questioning and the interview stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I conducted a statement of charges with the following charges listed:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;- Attempted Murder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;- Assault First Degree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;- Assault Second Degree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;- Reckless Endangerment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Wilgis was taken to the commissioners office in Worcester County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Worcester County, Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Case closed by arrest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
