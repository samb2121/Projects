         <NarrativeText>Thomas James Hennasey&lt;br /&gt; Maryland SOUNDEX: H-520-792-367-189&lt;br /&gt; Breath Test Result: 0.14&lt;br /&gt; DUI Citation #: 0BP0YJL&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; DUI Tape #: Video tagged as 23-MSP-006134 (Axon View XL Software).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CERTIFICATES AND TRAINING&lt;br /&gt; * Trained in administering Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) through the&lt;br /&gt; Maryland State Police and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;br /&gt; * Trained and certified to operate Radar and Lidar through the Maryland&lt;br /&gt; State Police.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -PHASE I: VEHICLE IN MOTION-&lt;br /&gt; On February 17, 2023, at approximately 0210 hours, I was on duty in official capacity as a Maryland State Trooper operating marked MSP vehicle T-21 in the area of Maryland Route 5 northbound just north of Mt. Wolf Road. I was traveling southbound in lane 2, on patrol. At that time, I observed a truck in lane 2, directly in front of my patrol vehicle. While behind the same vehicle, I made the following observations:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NORTH OF MT. WOLF RD&lt;br /&gt; 1. As the vehicle was traveling north in front of me, the vehicle&amp;#39;s driver&amp;#39;s side tires crossed (half the width of the truck) the dashed/dotted white line into lane one once for three seconds.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NORTH OF HOMELAND DR&lt;br /&gt; 2. The vehicle&amp;#39;s driver side tires crossed the dashed/dotted lines into Lane 1 on one (1) occasion. The vehicle swerved back into Lane 1.&lt;br /&gt; 3. The vehicle&amp;#39;s passenger side tires crossed the solid white line into the right shoulder area on one (1) occasions. The vehicle drifted back into the far right lane which was an exit ramp to MD Rt 231. The truck then swerved out of the exit ramp, crossing a solid white line, and back onto MD Rt 5 northbound.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; AT MARYLAND ROUTE 5 AND MARYLAND ROUTE 231&lt;br /&gt; 4. The vehicle then crossed the solid white shoulder line on the right hand side of the road on one (1) occasion and swerved back into Lane 2.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; AT MARYLAND ROUTE 5 AND OLIVER&amp;rsquo;S SHOP ROAD&lt;br /&gt; 5. The vehicle crossed the solid white shoulder line on the right hand side of the road on one (1) occasion and swerved back into Lane 2.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 5. The vehicle failed to maintain proper lane position due to pronounced and excessive weaving (alternately moving toward one side of the lane and then the other) during the entire duration of my observations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TRAFFIC STOP&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I activated the emergency lights to my patrol vehicle, initiating a traffic stop on Maryland Route 5 and Good Samaritan Dr. The vehicle slowly crossed onto the shoulder of MD Rt 5. The vehicle was a white 1997 GMC Truck bearing Maryland Registration 1CA5769.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -PHASE II: PERSONAL CONTACT-&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I made contact with the driver via the driver side door, and I immediately smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle. I informed the driver the reason for the stop and requested the driver&amp;#39;s license and registration card. The driver stated in an extremely slurred voice that he didn&amp;rsquo;t have his license and that his name was Louis Anthony Perticari (DOB: 11/12/1963). I asked the driver how much he had to drink and he stated that he had two beers. The driver was later identified through his MVA photo as Thomas James Hennasey (DOB: 03/12/1970 W/M).&lt;br /&gt; As Hennasey spoke, I made the following observations:&lt;br /&gt; 1. I intentionally observed his eyes to be glassy and bloodshot.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Hennasey displayed a glazed look/expression on his face as he communicated with me.&lt;br /&gt; I returned to my patrol vehicle to conduct routine checks on Hennasey.&lt;br /&gt; I later returned to the GMC and requested Hennasey exit the vehicle and walk to the front of it, to which he complied. When Hennasey exited the GMC, I observed an open Bud Light can in the cup-holder of the driver&amp;#39;s side door. While at the front of his vehicle, I continued to speak with Hennasey. As Hennasey spoke, I smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person. I informed Hennasey that I wanted him to perform field sobriety tests to determine any impairment, which he agreed to submit to.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -PHASE III: PRE-ARREST SCREENING-&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; STANDARDIZED FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS (SFSTs)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The evaluation was performed on the right shoulder area. The surface was level and free from any obvious debris. The weather was clear and there was no standing water/ice in the immediate area. Lighting conditions consisted of my flashlight and vehicle headlamps. I asked Hennasey if he had any significant medical issues with his body which would prevent him from performing the field sobriety tests or if he had taken any medication prior to driving. Hennasey responded: &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; Hennasey appeared to be in general good physical condition and did not display any limps or any limb ailments.&lt;br /&gt; Hennasey was wearing a plaid yellow and blue buttoned-shirt, a green short sleeve shirt that had the phrase &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Tread On Me&amp;rdquo; printed on it, black pants, and black boots.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; **HORIZONTAL GAZE NYSTAGMUS: 6 of 6 clues**&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. Hennasey displayed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Hennasey displayed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; 3. Hennasey displayed the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt; 4. Vertical Gaze Nystagmus was observed during this test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; **WALK AND TURN: 6 of 8 clues**&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. Hennasey could not maintain his balance during the Instruction Phase of the test. Hennasey&amp;#39;s feet broke from the start position on four occasions (4) occasions, and he stumbled to the left.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Hennasey attempted to begin the test prior to my demonstration and explanation despite being told to remain in the instructional position until told to begin.&lt;br /&gt; 3. Hennasey took a total of 9 steps during the first series. Hennasey also took a total of 9 steps during the second series.&lt;br /&gt; 4. Hennasey missed heel-to-toe on steps 3, 8 and 9 during the first series. Hennasey missed heel-to-toe on step 7 during the second series. All missed steps were of more than half an inch.&lt;br /&gt; 5. Hennasey kept his arms up for balance for all of the first series of steps and the second series.&lt;br /&gt; 7. Hennasey did not complete the turn in a satisfactory manner, turning to the right and not taking a series of small steps to complete the turn, which was contrary to my instructions.&lt;br /&gt; 8. Hennasey was unable to maintain a straight line and stepped off the line during all missed steps.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; **ONE LEG STAND: 4 of 4 clues**&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 1. Hennasey&amp;#39;s body immediately swayed to the left whenever he lifted his foot.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Hennasey places his foot down at count 6, 14, 16, 22, and 24.&lt;br /&gt; 3. Hennasey raises his arms at throughout the duration of the test.&lt;br /&gt; 4. Hennasey hopped while trying to maintain balance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ADDITIONAL ANNOTATIONS REFERENCE FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One leg stand: Hennasey did not raise his foot above 6 inches until after count 4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST (PBT)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After the conclusion of all Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, I offered Hennasey the opportunity to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). Hennasey submitted to a preliminary breath test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; PBT RESULT: 0.15&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hennasey later admitted to consuming three (3) Blue moon beers with oranges.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ARREST&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Based on the following, I had reason to believe Hennasey was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol:&lt;br /&gt; * Driving vehicle in a negligent manner which caused it to commit 6 designated lane direction violations in addition to excessive weaving - DRIVING SKILLS IMPAIRED.&lt;br /&gt; * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the interior of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; * Eyes glassy and bloodshot.&lt;br /&gt; * Glazed look/expression on face.&lt;br /&gt; * Admission to consuming three (3) alcoholic beverage prior to operating a motor vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; *Open alcohol container in front of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt; * Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath and person.&lt;br /&gt; * My observed signs of impairment as he performed field sobriety tests.&lt;br /&gt; I determined that Hennasey was impaired by the presence of an alcoholic beverage in his system that adversely affected his ability to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. The inability to perform the Standardized Field&lt;br /&gt; Sobriety Tests properly can also adversely affect the person&amp;#39;s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely. I placed Hennasey under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol at approximately 0238 hours on 02/17/2023. At this time, I visually inspected the inside of Hennasey&amp;#39;s mouth to check for foreign objects. None were found.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TRANSPORT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hennasey was subsequently transported to the La Plata Barrack for processing. During transport, the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from Hennasey continued to be strong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ADVICE OF RIGHTS (DR-15)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hennasey was read the DR-15 form on the English audio version on the MVA website in the front seat of my patrol car. At 0314 hours, on February 17, 2023, Hennasey agreed to submit to an Intoximeter Test and signed his copy of the DR-15.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; **INTOXIMETER RESULT**:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Prior to the breath test, Corporal M. Warrenfeltz #6510 visually check the inside of Hennasey&amp;#39;s mouth for any foreign objects. None were found.&lt;br /&gt; The breath test was administered by CPL Warrenfeltz at approximately 0403 hours on 02/17/2023, and two (2) sufficient samples of Hennasey&amp;#39;s breath were obtained. The breath specimen was found to contain an alcohol concentration of 0.14 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; RELEASE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hennasey was provided all forms and citations and was released to a sober driver at approximately 0500 hours on 02/17/2023.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CHARGES&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hennasey was charged with the following citations:&lt;br /&gt; 1.
