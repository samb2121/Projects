         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;ATTACHMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1.) Two CD&amp;#39;s of recorded interview with alleged victim, Allycianna Santiago, placed in case file.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; 2.) Washington County CPS Worksheet Intake, placed in case file.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NARRATIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On 5/19/2023, I, Sgt. Angermeier was notified by Washington County CPS of an incoming case of alleged child sex abuse. It was reported the alleged victim, Allycianna Santiago, 13 YOA, is feeling suicidal.&amp;nbsp;Allycianna reported when she as from ages 1-5 she was sexually abused by a boy also in foster care.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 5/23/2023 at approximately 1440 hours, Case Worker Kris Hoffman conducted a forensic interview on&amp;nbsp;Allycianna. The interview was recorded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CW Hoffman first went over who&amp;nbsp;Allycianna lives with. CW Hoffman then asked her about living with her mother.&amp;nbsp;Allycianna advised, &amp;quot;I think it will be a good change to have the family back.&amp;nbsp;Allycianna advised her father is in rehab.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Allycianna advised she prefers to go by &amp;quot;Ally.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CW Hoffman asked Ally if she knew why she was there to speak to her and she advised she did not. Ally then went on to explain that she has one favorite teacher that she tells most things to and maybe that was why she was there to speak to CW Hoffman. Ally went on to explain that some things happened to her while she was in foster care. Alley said she lived with Carol Rith, Ages 1-5 or 6.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ally stated that Carol&amp;#39;s son &amp;quot;used to do stuff to me.&amp;quot; She identified Carol&amp;#39;s son as &amp;quot;Cameron.&amp;quot; Ally said Cameron would touch her in her &amp;quot;private area.&amp;quot; CW Hoffman then got out the anatomical drawings of a male and a female. She referred to the vagina as &amp;quot;vagina&amp;quot; and the breasts as &amp;quot;boobs.&amp;quot; CW Hoffman asked Ally where Cameron touched on her body and she pointed to the vagina. CW Hoffman asked Ally what he used to touch her and she pointed to the hand on the drawing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CW Hoffman asked Ally about the first time this happened and Ally advised it was at &amp;quot;Carl&amp;#39;s house.&amp;quot; (Carols father). Ally advised Cameron told her he wanted to play a game and he shut the door behind them. CW Hoffman asked Ally if his touch was skin to skin on her vagina and she stated it was skin to skin and also inside her vagina and outside her vagina.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CW Hoffman asked Ally if this type of incident happened anywhere else and she stated, &amp;quot;It happened a lot.&amp;quot; (About a year). Ally advised another incident was when they were playing truth or dare and he slammed her up against the wall and again, touched her vagina with his fingers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CW Hoffman asked Ally if any other body part of Cameron&amp;#39;s touched her vagina and she advised no, however, there was one time where he made Ally touch his penis. Ally said this occurred in Carol&amp;#39;s basement. Ally said Cameron is &amp;quot;Two or more&amp;quot; years older than she is. Ally advised the last time it occurred was when she was four years old.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ally did disclose that she took pictures of her breasts by herself, not forced or coerced, later to have &amp;quot;a girl at school&amp;quot; hacked her phone and sent the picture out to the school. Ally advised the school and &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; is aware of the photo. CW Hoffman gave advice to Ally on taking photos and sending them out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The interview concluded at 1543 hours. See the recorded CD&amp;#39;s for further details.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 5/24/2023, I contacted ASA Christine Remsburg, and she was briefed on the case. We both agreed the suspect was 6/7 years old at the time of the crime, to which he cannot be charged.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Due to the above facts, the case is closed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Washington County, MD.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
