         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Incident:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Motor Vehicle Collision&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Driver:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Charles Tubbs Sr (W/M 6/27/1940)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Location:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Whitehaven Rd &amp;amp; Nanticoke Rd, Quantico MD 21856&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Date:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;7/18/2023&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Time:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;1648 hours&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Narrative:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On 7/18/23 at approximately 1648 hours, I TFC Eckrich, was dispatched to the area of Whitehaven Rd and Nanticoke Rd in reference to a single vehicle accident into a tree. Upon my arrival, I observed a red Dodge Ram 1500 bearing Maryland registration 21R830 in a tree line off the roadway. The driver and sole occupant of the vehicle was identified as Charles Tubbs Sr (W/M 6/27/40). Tubbs had already been transported by Hebron EMS to Tidal Health prior to my arrival on scene. I was advised by Fire/EMS personnel that were still on scene, that Tubbs was considered priority 1 with life-threatening injuries. Fire personnel stated that they did not notice any odor of alcohol coming from Tubbs&amp;#39; person. Tubbs was identified by his Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license. Upon further investigation it was determined that Tubbs was traveling West on Whitehaven Rd when it appeared that his vehicle went over the right shoulder line. Based on the skid marks left by the tires it appears that Tubbs suddenly veered to the left, causing him to go off the roadway striking multiple trees. Due to the seriousness of injury I requested an accident re-constructionist respond to the scene. I noticed in the rear seat of the vehicle was an open bottle of &amp;quot;Lord Calvert&amp;quot; which is an alcoholic beverage. While on scene I contacted Tidal Health emergency department, and they advised Tubbs was listed in critical condition. S/Tpr S. Marshall responded to the scene to conduct the reconstruction investigation. City Towing towed the vehicle from the scene.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I responded to Tidal Health to get an update on Tubbs condition. According to hospital personnel Tubbs was in critical condition with a small brain bleed. I made contact with Tubbs&amp;#39; wife identified as Ruth Tubbs (W/F 11/20/46). Ruth advised that Charles was visiting a friend and was on his way home at the time of the accident. Ruth advised that Charles had been having some difficulty breathing as of late and was supposed to be on oxygen. Over the past couple weeks Charles&amp;#39; pulse oximeter had been going down to the lower 90&amp;#39;s in the evening time. Charles had not been on his oxygen at the time of the accident. I inquired about the bottle of &amp;quot;Lord Calvert&amp;quot; and Ruth stated that he has had that bottle for approximately 3 years. Based on speaking with Ruth and the nurses at Tidal Health, I do not believe alcohol was a factor in this accident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 7/19/23 at approximately 1430 hours, I contacted Tidal Health to check on Charles status. As of the time of the call, Charles was listed in critical but stable condition. I was also advised by MSP Salisbury barrack that a witness to the accident had called the barrack. I called the witness who was identified as Jason Schroeder (W/M 4/24/02). Schroeder stated that he was traveling in the opposite direction on Whitehaven Rd, when he noticed Charles&amp;#39; red Dodge truck. Schroeder observed the right side tires of Charles&amp;#39; vehicle go over the right shoulder line. As Schroeder passed Charles&amp;#39; vehicle he looked in his rearview mirror and observed Charles vehicle sharply turn to the left crossing the center line and then going off the roadway to the left into the tree line. Schroeder stopped his vehicle and attempted to help Charles out of his vehicle. When fire personnel arrived on scene, Schroeder left the scene&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At this time the accident reconstruction investigation has been turned over to S/Tpr S. Marshall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Wicomico County Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;Detailed Crash Investigation Report &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;(For review by the MSP&amp;nbsp;Crash Team)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Section I. - Introduction:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On 7/18/2023 at approximately 1650 hours, Troopers from the Maryland State Police Salisbury Barrack were dispatched to respond to the area of Whitehaven Road and Nanticoke Road, Hebron, Wicomico County, Maryland reference a single vehicle motor vehicle collision. Prior to their arrival, Troopers were advised that the vehicle had traveled off the roadway and into the trees. Troopers were also advised the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle possibly sustained life-threatening injuries. Upon arrival to the scene, Troopers learned the vehicle involved in the collision was a 2008 Dodge Ram pickup truck and the driver was Mr. Charles Tubbs SR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Preliminary investigations revealed the Dodge was traveling on Whitehaven Road just prior to Nanticoke Road. For an unknown reason, the Dodge traveled onto the right shoulder line and then traveled back onto the roadway. The Dodge then crossed the double yellow lines of the center of the roadway, traveled on the southbound lane of Whitehaven Road, traveled over the shoulder and down into a ditch, and struck multiple trees. After striking the trees, the Dodge rotated and came to its final resting position.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Due to the nature of this collision, a request was made for a Reconstructionist to respond to the scene. I, Senior Trooper S. Marshall was contacted at 1717 hours and responded to the scene.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The scene was photographed and marked for processing. The Dodge was towed from the scene by City Towing. The roadway closure was approximately three hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The scope of this investigation will address the various elements that caused and/or contributed to the collision event. The scope of this investigation was accomplished by either direct investigation action of through the review of the findings from other investigative sources.&amp;nbsp; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section II. - Scene Description: (The following descriptions are based on the area where the collision occurred.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Primary Roadway:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whitehaven Road, is also known as Maryland Route 352. Whitehaven Road traveled in an east and west direction. The stretch of roadway the collision occurred on was straight and did not have a change in elevation. The stretch of roadway where the collision had occurred on had no artifical lighting and was in an area surrounded by cornfields. The center of the roadway was marked by solid yellow lane markers. The eastbound lane was supported by a solid white line. The westbound lane was supported by a solid white line. The surface was constructed of asphalt material and appeared to be in good condition. The posted speed limit was 50 miles per hour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Environmental Conditions:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At the time of the collision, the weather was reported clear, dry, with an approximate temperature of 90 degrees at the time of the collision. There were no adverse weather conditions that would have contributed to the collision.&amp;nbsp; &lt;hr /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section III. - Scene Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was able to observe several skid marks on the roadway from the Dodge. (Refer to Pictures DSCN 2023,2034,and 2059). The skid marks started in the northbound travel portions of the roadway and crossed over the solid yellow lane markers into the southbound travel portion. I used spray paint and follow the directions of the skid marks on the roadway. The first marking that I obtained a measurement for was approximately 97 feet in length.
