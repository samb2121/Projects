         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On 5/21/2023 at approximately 0041 hours, I was dispatched to 9600 Cordova Rd, Easton MD. In reference to a check welfare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Upon my arrival, I met with the complainant Dina Marie Spry and the suspect Somer Eileen Wilkes, who were both on the front porch, and I observed Wilkes to be heavily intoxicated. Spry stated the following. She received a phone call from her sister, Carol Ann Wise and was told that Wilkes was holding a blanket over Wilkes&amp;rsquo; infants face. Wilkes was drunk and she is not supposed to be drinking, due to a current open Department of Social Service&amp;rsquo;s case. I asked Spry for her identification, as she walked to her vehicle. At that time, I made contact with Wilkes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I questioned Wilkes on what happened and she stated &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo;. I then asked Wilkes if she needed EMS to come check on her due to her intoxication, which she refused. I questioned Wilkes if the infant was ok, as she nodded yes, waved me into the residence and walked me to the infant&amp;rsquo;s location. Wilkes walked me into a bedroom where I observed a sleeping toddler and an infant who was stirring around. The infant was not crying, screaming, wheezing or in distress and I did not observe any injuries or signs of injuries on the infant. As Wilkes walked me through her residence, we took a right turn from the front kitchen door into the living room, walked through the living room and made a left turn into the bedroom where the infant and toddler were located. I observed closed window curtains throughout the house and both the living room and bedroom did not appear disturbed. At that time, I walked Wilkes back outside onto the porch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While on the porch DSS worker Leah Borkowski, contacted Spry. Spry explained to Borkowski that Wilkes was intoxicated and put a blanket of the infants head. Spry then handed me the phone and I spoke with Borkowski. Borkowski stated there is a safety plan in place, but nothing about Wilkes&amp;rsquo; alcohol use. Borkowski stated she needed to contact her supervisor and would be in touch after doing so. I walked back to the porch, gave Spry her phone back, and observed a vehicle pull on scene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I made contact with Carol Ann Wise, an occupant in the vehicle and she stated the following. Earlier in the evening, she was at Wilkes&amp;rsquo; residence before Wilkes kicked her out and she left without incident, before returning later in the evening. When she returned to the residence, she observed a blanket over Wilkes&amp;rsquo; infant, Wilkes&amp;rsquo;s arm over the baby and stating shut up. At that time, she picked the infant up and started patting the infants back. I asked Wise or Spry if they would be willing to take the toddler and infant for the night and Wise stated she would. I asked Spry to contact Borkowski and make sure that was ok. Wise repeated what had happened and she stated she could hear the infant from outside. After the incident, Wise left and contacted Spry and notified her. Spry stated she made contact with Borkowski but was waiting for a call back. While we were waiting I had Spry check on the children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Borkowski called Spry back and stated the following. After speaking with her supervisor, she asked if either Spry or Wise could stay at Wilkes residence or take the children for the remainder of the weekend, until Monday. Wise stated she was not staying at the house with Wilkes but would take the children home until Monday. Borkowski stated a verbal safety plan would be completed which would allow Wise to take the children until Monday. I then spoke to Borkowski and she confirmed that Wise would be taking the kids until Monday and the on-call worker social worker would contact Wilkes and Wise in the morning to complete the verbal safety plan. I explained to Borkowski that I would assist Wise and Spry gather the children and essential items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I assisted Wise and Spry with loading up the essential items in Wise&amp;rsquo;s vehicle as Wise was holding the infant. The infant began to wheeze and cough, when Wise stated the baby was sick with &amp;ldquo;Rhinovirus&amp;rdquo;. At that time, I requested EMS to respond to my location to check on the infant. Talbot County EMS responded to the residence and transported the infant to University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton (run # 2023-00035983), per Wise&amp;rsquo;s request. Wise rode with the infant in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Case OPEN pending further investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All events occurred in Talbot County MD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>On June 7, 2023, at 1357 hours I, Sgt Antal, conducted an Interview with Carol Wise (Wise) at the Talbot County Department of Social Services. The following is a synopsis and not a comprehensive transcription of the interview with Wise which was audibly recorded: &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that she was babysitting Somer Wilkes&amp;#39; (Wilkes) two children, David Velazquez (DOB 8-3-2023) and Scarlett Velazquez (DOB 8-3-18)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stayed with Wilkes because of her (Wilkes) drinking problem and to help Wilkes&amp;nbsp;with her children&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wilkes asked Wise to leave on the day of May&amp;nbsp;20, 2023&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise called&amp;nbsp;Wilkes later that evening to check on her and recognized that Wilkes was intoxicated&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;While on the phone Wilkes tells Wise that she has to get off the phone to &amp;quot;deal with this fucking baby&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;When Wise arrives to Wilkes&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;residence she can hear David Velazquez crying&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise was able to locate Wilkes&amp;#39; keys on the front porch and make entry into the residence&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;When Wise walks into the residence she can hear David Velazquez having trouble breathing&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise walked&amp;nbsp;into bedroom and observed&amp;nbsp;Wilkes holding David Velazquez face-first to her chest, in fleece pajamas, a blanket&amp;nbsp;over David Velazquez&amp;#39;s head and her arm pressing David Velazquez&amp;#39;s head against Wilkes chest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that Wilkes was yelling at David Velazquez to &amp;quot;shut the fuck up&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise took&amp;nbsp;David Velazquez from Wilkes and observes that David Velazquez is &amp;quot;beet red&amp;quot; and sweating&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise opened David Velazquez&amp;#39;s clothing to help him breath&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that Scarlett Velazquez&amp;nbsp;was asleep during the incident&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;When Wise asked Wilkes what was she trying to do Wilkes would not answer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise asked Wilkes if she could take the children because of her level of intoxication&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated&amp;nbsp;that she does not believe that Wilkes was intentionally trying to kill David Velazquez&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wilkes asked Wise to leave the residence,&amp;nbsp;Wise left the residence then Wise contacted her sister&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that after the police arrived, and she was able to take the children she observed David Velazquez to still having trouble breathing and decided to take David Velazquez to the Emergency Room&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that Emergency Room staff stated Wilkes neglected to give David Velazquez a prescribed breathing treatment for a current illness which was compounded with the&amp;nbsp;extra heat from clothing and Wilkes pressing his head to her chest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise described&amp;nbsp;that Wilkes was on her side laying on the bed and David Velazquez was laying on the bed with his nose facing Wilkes&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;chest, one arm was under David Velazquez&amp;#39;s rear and the other arm was over his head&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise could hear Wilkes yelling to David Velazquez in English and Spanish to shut up&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise was unable to tell how tight Wilkes was holding David Velazquez to her chest&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that she does not believe that Wilkes was intentional trying to hurt David Velazquez but that when Wilkes drinks she does not know her strength&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise described&amp;nbsp;the positions of Wilkes and David Velazquez&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise described&amp;nbsp;the noise&amp;nbsp;David Velazquez was making and states that it sounded like&amp;nbsp;David Velazquez&amp;#39;s breathing was being blocked&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise talked&amp;nbsp;about a couple of incidents that she has heard of involving the children&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that on the night of the incident Wilkes had three bottles of wine and that Wilkes drinks everyday&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;When Wise was asked what she thought would have happened that night if she was not there she stated that&amp;nbsp;David Velazquez could have died&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that the temperature in the residence was hot and&amp;nbsp;David Velazquez was overheating&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise has known Wilkes for 30 years, and she had been drinking since her teens&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that Scarlett Velazquez was on the bed towards the bottom&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise described some concerning eating behavior that the children have&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wise describes Wilkes&amp;#39; drinking issues&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise stated that she does not think Wilkes was intentionally trying to kill&amp;nbsp;David Velazquez but just didn&amp;#39;t realize how hot he was&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Wise describes some mental health issues that Wilkes has&lt;/li&gt;

During the morning hours of June 29, 2023, the Easton Police Department responded to this location for the report of an unconscious and unresponsive infant who was later identified as Velasquez. Talbot County Emergency Medical Services provided resuscitatives measures and transported Valesquez to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton where Velasquez was pronounced dead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In response to the death investigation of Velasquez, members of CEDER contacted the Talbot County Detention Center who advised that Wilkes&amp;#39; cellular device and other belongings were currently being stored at their facility within their property room, and they a search and seizure warrant was required to seize the devices from that location. I, Corporal D. Tilghman #6254, authored a search and seizure warrant for the Property Room at the Talbot County Detention Center to seize the mobile devices belonging to Wilkes. The search and seizure warrant was reviewed and authorized by the Honorable Karen R. Ketterman, Judge of the District Court for Talbot County, Maryland on June 29, 2023 at 2101 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Troopers assigned to the Maryland State Police - Easton Barrack attempted to serve the search and seizure warrant; however, they were advised by staff at the Talbot County Detention Center that the cellular telephones belonging to Wilkes were released that same date at approximately 1530 hours to an individual identified as Suda Nicole Welch (&amp;quot;Welch&amp;quot;; W/F, DOB: 08/03/2022) who resides at 6181 Bethlehem Road, Preston, Caroline County, Maryland 21655. Troopers and I responded to that location and made contact with Welch who advised that she was in possession of two cellular devices that she retrieved from the detention center that belonged to Wilkes. I read the contents of an MSP Form 78: Consent to Search and Seize form and Welch provided written consent to seize the following two cellular devices:&amp;nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Dark Blue Motorola Smartphone - Cracked Display&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Black Apple iPhone in Black Case&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The above cellular devices were transported to and stored in the Maryland State Police - Easton Barrack property room pending the issuance of a search and seizure warrant to conduct data extractions on the devices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Case disposition to be determined by the lead investigator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeTitle>Interview Jess Flaherty</NarrativeTitle>
         <NarrativeText>On June 21, 2023, at 1524 hours an interview with Jess Flaherty at the Talbot County Child Advocacy Center. The following narrative was authored by CPS Leah Borkowski:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;CPS Investigator Kristyn Wheeler and MSP Detective Antel met with resource home/respite provider Jess Flaherty at the Talbot County Child Advocacy Center. Det. Antel told Jess that they had a few questions about how the comments by Scarlett came up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jess explained that the first time that everything came up, Scarlett was at Jess&amp;rsquo; home for day respite while another child was at the home as well. Jess explained that the other child shut the bedroom door while Scarlett was playing in the room with Jess&amp;rsquo; daughter, and Scarlett became hysterical and began panicking in the corner of the room.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jess described that she entered the room and asked Scarlett what was wrong. Scarlett expressed fear and sadness about being in the room while it was locked, despite it not being locked. Jess described another time when she took Scarlett into the bathroom to wash her hands, and Scarlett began crying and hyperventilating about the door being shut. Jess explained that anytime the door is shut while she is in the room, she begins to panic.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jess shared that once overnights started, Scarlett would wake up every 20 minutes with &amp;ldquo;night terrors&amp;rdquo; where she screams and comes and gets Jess. Jess explained that Scarlett will say &amp;ldquo; I need water, I need food&amp;rdquo; and says &amp;ldquo;Mommy locks me in the room and I can&amp;rsquo;t eat, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t let me eat&amp;rdquo; and repeats herself saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jess told Kristyn and Det. Antel about a time when Scarlett told her that she was mean because Jess would not let Scarlett into her bedroom. Jess shared that she asked Scarlett about being let out of her room in the morning, and that Scarlett has told Jess that Scarlett&amp;rsquo;s mom hits her, hits her dad, hits Baby David, and that her dad is afraid of her mom.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jess shared that these disclosures will come up when Jess asks her what&amp;rsquo;s wrong after Scarlett becomes very panicky. Jess explained that there was another time when David was in the family room in a bouncy seat while Jess was in another room, and David&amp;rsquo;s began screaming so she ran out to the family room. Jess described that Scarlett was in the family room attempting to lift David out of the seat when Jess worried she might accidentally hurt him so she lifted David from Scarlett&amp;rsquo;s hands. Jess explained that Scarlett became fearful by this and then told Jess that she hurt David on purpose. Jess told Scarlett that Scarlett did not hurt him on purpose and that it was an accident, but Scarlett repeated that she was bad and did try to hurt him. Jess expressed that she felt Scarlett was &amp;ldquo;regurgitating&amp;rdquo; something that she heard from someone else,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jess explained that she had spoken with this writer (CPS investigator Leah Borkowski) to seek guidance on what to do and this writer told Jess to start documenting the things that Scarlett disclosed to her. Jess explained that Scarlett disclosed that her mom hits her and David in the face. Jess also reported that Scarlett disclosed that &amp;ldquo;mom puts the pillow over David&amp;rsquo;s face so he can&amp;rsquo;t breathe.&amp;rdquo; When asked if there was any indication if Scarlett saw those things happen herself, Jess explained that Scarlett said that she saw, as her and David sleep in the bed with their mom, and she saw her mom put the pillow on David&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When asked if Scarlett was able to disclose a number of times that this happened, Jess said that Scarlett could not, and that she also could not give context for when it might have happened. Jess shared that Scarlett disclosed that &amp;ldquo;Mommy doesn&amp;rsquo;t want me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jess shared that when she spoke with Dina Spry about being in contact with Ms. Wilkes, Ms. Spry told her that everyone is afraid of Ms. Wilkes, including herself. Jess shared that Scarlett has disclosed that Ms. Wilkes will buy her things if she hits Scarlett, and that sometimes when Scarlett is upset, she will ask Jess &amp;ldquo;will you buy me something if I&amp;rsquo;m happy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;nbsp;  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Det Antel and CPS investigator Kristyn Wheeler thanked Jess for the information.&lt;/p&gt; </NarrativeText>
