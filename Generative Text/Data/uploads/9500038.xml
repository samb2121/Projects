         <NarrativeText>On May 18th, 2023, I, Trooper Damiano #7387, currently assigned to the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack, was dispatched at 0603 hours to a call at 109 Gadd Drive, Centreville, MD 21617 in reference to an assault that occurred at approximately 2330 and 0130 hours on 5/17/2023 in Grasonville.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arrival, I made contact with the complainant, Shelby Lynn Kelly (2/F DOB: 09/09/2002). I observed a red mark at the bridge of her nose and her nose was swollen and bruised. I also observed a red mark developing on the left side of her face. Upon speaking with Kelly, I learned that she and her live-in boyfriend, Nicholas Lawrence Keith Young (1/M DOB: 05/10/1998), had an altercation earlier in the evening at Kelly&amp;#39;s apartment located at 3D Fisher Manor, Grasonville, MD 21638.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Kelly stated Young came home drunk and high around 2330 hours. Kelly was home with her two children asleep in their room. Young and Kelly began consensually rough housing in a manner that she considered playful. Kelly then stated it turned violent when Young pushed her to the ground. Young then covered Kelly&amp;#39;s mouth and pinched her nose shut, causing her to be unable to breath for several moments. Young then accused Kelly of cheating on him with one of his friends. Kelly stated that she had never met the friend. Young then pinched Kelly&amp;rsquo;s nose and covered her mouth with his hand again. While cutting off her airways, Young&amp;rsquo;s finger slipped into Kelly&amp;rsquo;s mouth and she bit him. Young responded by biting Kelly on the nose causing her to bleed from a cut on the bridge of her nose and inside her nasal passages. He then asked Kelly if she was done. Young also began asking if Kelly had called the police. She told him she hadn&amp;rsquo;t. Young did not believe her and broke her phone. Kelly had no other means to call for help. Young threatened to kill Kelly multiple times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Kelly then attempted to go to the bathroom and Young followed her in. Young again pinched her nose and covered her mouth with his hand. Young then pinched Kelly on her left breast. Young then told Kelly he wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to stop hurting her unless she went to sleep with him in their bedroom. Fearing for her life, Kelly complied. Around 0030 hours on May 18th, Kelly attempted to sneak out of their bedroom and went into her children&amp;rsquo;s toy room. Young then came up behind her and wrapped his hands around her neck and choked her. Kelly then lost consciousness. Upon waking, Kelly recalled him asking her if she was done and ready for bed. Kelly complied. Kelly then stated that she attempted to leave multiple times throughout the night but Young kept waking up and prevented her from leaving. Around 0530 hours, Kelly was able to collect her two children and leave the house in her vehicle. Young attempted to follow and stop her but was unsuccessful. Kelly immediately went to her Aunt&amp;rsquo;s house at 109 Gadd Drive and contacted us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I then asked Kelly if she had any additional injuries from the incident and she stated that she did. Kelly then showed me a large purple bruise on her left breast. Photos were taken of Kelly injuries. I then conducted a lethality screening on Kelly and she screened in at high risk. I called Mid-Shore Domestic Violence Hotline and Kelly spoke to a counselor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Kelly also feared that Young might still be at her apartment and asked us to check it for her. Kelly stated that Young did not have any means of transportation and did not have many friends in the area. Kelly also stated there was no one besides Young at the apartment and he did not have access to any firearms. Upon checking Young through NCIC, he came back with multiple caution codes for armed and dangerous and suicidal. Young also had multiple open warrants for first degree assault, armed robbery, and false imprisonment out of Baltimore County.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arriving at 3D Fisher Manor at 0842 hours, we knocked on the door and no one answered. I then met with the manager of the apartment complex to see if there was any footage of Young leaving the residence. At 0529 hours, Kelly was observed leaving in her car with Young following after her and going back inside when she left. The manager was unable to fast forward the footage to observe if Young had left in the last three hours. We then met with Kelly and she agreed to let us into her apartment to clear it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Myself and TFC Barbiche #6649 made entry through the back door and cleared the first floor. We made our way to the second floor and after clearing a bedroom, Young made his presence known. Young yelled &amp;ldquo;Come in here I&amp;rsquo;ll kill myself!&amp;rdquo;. We announced our presence as state police. Young replied &amp;ldquo;I know.&amp;rdquo; We discovered Young was locked in the second floor bathroom. Young then stated, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll kill myself. I&amp;rsquo;ll slice my neck open.&amp;rdquo; We made it known we didn&amp;rsquo;t want that. Young yelled &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll fuckin do that!&amp;rdquo; I observed multiple fresh droplets of blood throughout the hallway of the second floor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While attempting to speak with Young, he demanded a cigarette. We then continued talking with Young and asked if he was alright. Young then asked to speak with his grandmother. I then acquiesced his request and had an open line of communication with his grandmother Pat. Young stated that if he had a cigarette, he would be a man of his word and come out of the bathroom. We than asked Young where he had cut himself and he stated his wrists. TFC Barbiche then asked what he had cut himself with. Young stated &amp;ldquo;a knife.&amp;rdquo; He then stated it was a &amp;ldquo;steak knife.&amp;rdquo; He then stated it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time and he had scars all up and down his arms. Myself, TFC Barbiche, and Pat attempted multiple times to reason with Young and get him to surrender. During this time, EMS, S.T.A.T.E. Team, and Mobile Crisis were contacted and enroute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After approximately 20 minutes of speaking to Young through the closed bathroom door, he agreed to come out. Young surrendered and was unarmed and was taken into custody at 0944 hours. Young displayed self-inflicted lacerations and stab wounds on both his arms. Young was positively identified and was taken into custody for assault against Kelly, an open warrant through Baltimore County, and an emergency petition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He received medical attention from Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s County EMS #300 and was transported to Anne Arundel Medical Center for an emergency petition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At 1250 hours, Anne Arundel Medical Center took custody of Young. Young was held for psychological evaluation. He was held on a detainer and transferred to Sheppard Pratt - Towson Campus for further evaluation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On May 19th, 2023, I went to the Queen Anne&amp;rsquo;s County Commissioner and applied for charges. I was then granted a warrant for first degree assault, second degree assault, and reckless endangerment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On May 26th, 2023, I learned that Young was being released from the Sheppard Pratt - Towson Campus in Baltimore County, Maryland. I then traveled to the hospital and took custody of Young at 1030 hours. I then brought Young before the Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County Commissioner 1224 hours to serve multiple warrants. Young was held without bail and released to the custody of the Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County Detention Center at 1432 hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All criminal events occurred in Queen Anne&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
