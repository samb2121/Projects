         <NarrativeText>&lt;div&gt;Crime: Driving Under the Influence&lt;br /&gt; Weather: Clear&lt;br /&gt; Defendant: Juan Carlos Guallpa Pinguil&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Date of Birth: 02/28/1998&lt;br /&gt; Date of Arrest: 05/27/2023&lt;br /&gt; Time of Arrest:0202 hours&lt;br /&gt; License #: No License&lt;br /&gt; DUI # 23-54-107&lt;br /&gt; Subsequent Offender: Unknown&lt;br /&gt; No Accident Involved:&lt;br /&gt; No CDS Involved: No&lt;br /&gt; PBT: results were .15&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On 05/27/2023 at approximately 0145 hours I was in the area of N Salisbury Blvd and Columbia Ave near the dealerships, when I observed 2 vehicles traveling s/b at what appeared to be a higher rate then the posted speed limit of 40 mph. I pulled out from where I was sitting and attempted to get a speed reading on them, however I was unable to get a speed. I observed the red car turn off but do to the dark blue car having a burnt out tag light, I followed behind that vehicle and initiated a stop on that vehicle. The car was 2008 Toyota Scion. I activated my lights around Main St and Rt 13 s/b and the vehicle slowed down in lane 2. The vehicle&amp;#39;s driver appeared to be stopping in lane 2 or was going to turn into the parking lot of the La Quinta Inn. The driver then for unknown reasons made an unsafe turn from lane 2 crossed the turn lane and N/B traffic and stopped near the railroad tax on Carrol St.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I made contact with the driver and after some language issues and translating on the phone with Google Translate, I was able to identify him as Juan Guallpa. Guallpa eyes were glassy and blood shot and when I approached the driver to speak to him, I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. The when speaking speech was slightly slurred. After Identifying the driver I asked the driver to step out of his vehicle for so Standardized Field Sobriety Test. The driver agreed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The area that I had the driver use for the test was level and free of any debris. I asked the driver if he was injured I believe his response was yeah, but never told me where or how he was hurt. He stood with his hands out and trying act like he was doing a test for field sobriety. I advised him to just stand there and listen to me. The first test that I had him do was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The results of the HGN test were as Follows:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1.) Lack of smooth pursuit in each eye Clue 1and 2&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2.) Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus in each eye Clue3 and 4&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3.) Onset of Nystagmus in each eye Clue 5 and 6&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The second test that was given and demonstrated was the Walk and Turn Test, I received 4 out 8 clues on this test they were as follows:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1.) Started the test to soon&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2.) Could not maintain balance during the instructional phase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3.) Arms away from his body for balance&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 4.) Missed heel to toe on step 3,6 and 8 of the first set of nine steps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Guallpa never completed the turn or the second set of steps on this test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The third test that was given and demonstrated was the One Leg Stand test I received 3 out of 4 clues on this test they were as follows:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1.) Swayed while balancing&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2.) Hands away from his body by more than 6 inches&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3.) Foot down twice with in the 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; After the field test I offered Guallpa the PBT, and he agreed and his results were .15. Along with Guallpa driving and field test I determined that he had too much alcohol to be driving, and I placed Guallpa under arrest for DUI/DWI. Guallpa was taken back to the barrack for processing. With Guallpa speaking spanish I did use the MVA online Spanish Audion version of the DR15 and played it from my computer in the vehicle. At the conclusion, Guallpa decided to not take the breath test. Guallpa was polite and cooperative. Guallpa was released on citations to his friend that was sober.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events did occur in Wicomico County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; </NarrativeText>
