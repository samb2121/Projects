         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suspect:&lt;br /&gt; MD10272949711&lt;br /&gt; David Michael Elza&lt;br /&gt; W/M DOB 11/20/1987&lt;br /&gt; 3745 Dublin Rd.&lt;br /&gt; Darlington, MD 21034&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Victim:&lt;br /&gt; MD10272896035&lt;br /&gt; W/F DOB 03/03/1988&lt;br /&gt; 3745 Dublin Rd.&lt;br /&gt; Darlington, MD 21034&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 11/15/2023 I respond to 3745 Dublin Rd. in Darlington, Harford County MD for an assault. Upon arrival I made contact with the defendant named above, David Michael Elza. Elza advised that he and his girlfriend got into an argument while laying in bed. His girlfriend, Sima Pater-Rov asked him if he ever though about quitting drinking. Elza asked if Pater-Rov thought about not taking her anxiety medication. At that time a verba argument began. Elza attempted to get out of bed ad walk away and his girlfriend, Sima Pater-Rov followed him. As she was approaching him he wrapped his arms around her in an attempt to calm her down. Elza stated that when she said she was calling police he let go of her. Elza had no visible injures at the time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Contact was made with the girlfriend, Sima Pater-Rov. Pater-Rov stated that they did get into an argument while laying in bed and that it escalated into a physical confrontation. Pater-Rov advised that she asked Elza to seep in another room and not to touch her and that if he did she would call the police. At that time, Elza began reaching for Pater-Rov&amp;rsquo;s phone. Pater-Rov stated that Elza used a pillow to hit her multiple times in the face before falling to the floor. Once on the floor Elza continued to assault her with the pillow. Pater-Rov stated that Elza wrapped his arms around her upper chest/neck area with her sweater hood over her head obstructing her airway passage. Pater-Rov had difficulty breathing at the time. While on the floor, Elza was using knee placed on her chest to hold her down. Pater-Rov stated that she was in fear for her life due to being choked.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After arriving on scene, it was observed that Pater-Rov had marks around her upper chest and neck as well as a cut on her neck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is not prior history of domestic violence between both parties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on my observations, Elza was placed under arrest for 1st&amp;nbsp;and 2nd-degree&amp;nbsp;assault at 2337 hours. I transported Elza to the Bel Air barrack where I completed the appropriate paperwork. Elza was&amp;nbsp;taken to the Harford County Detention Center at 0205 hours to await his initial appearance in front of a commissioner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pater-Rov completed the MSP form 246, Domestic Violence Supplemental Report. Based on Pater-Rov&amp;#39;s answers, she did not assess as being in high danger but I believe she could be if no further action is taken. Pater-Rov was provided a victim brochure and was referred to the commissioner&amp;#39;s office to obtain a protective order. Pater-Rov refuse any medical treatment on scene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Harford County, MD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

I arrived on scene and a male, later identified as David Michael Elza (DOB:11/20/1987 2/M) immediately walked out the front entrance of the residence with his hands in the air. TFC Wantz #6688 of the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks made contact with Elza.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I approached the front entrance door to the residence and made contact with the complainant, identified through her Maryland issued driver&amp;#39;s license as Sima Pater-Rov (DOB: 03/03/1988 2/F).&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov appeared to be breathing heavily and crying. I asked&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov what happened this evening to which, she advised she was attempting to go to bed because she has work in the morning. Pater-Rov advised Elza began speaking with her.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov added &amp;quot;Now just to give you a little history we argue every night and he. He drinks every day. So being a sober person and dealing with someone whose drunk all the time is not easy.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated she was trying to go to sleep and Elza began talking about medication she had been prescribed and taking since 2012.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated Elza was trying to start a fight with her. I asked&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov what medication she was referring to, to which, she stated Citalopram for depression.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov continued detailing the events of the evening and stated, &amp;quot;so then he&amp;#39;s like have you ever thought about not taking that. to start a fight with me.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov advised she asked Elza if she could just go to bed to which, he took a pillow and began striking her person with it.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated she requested Elza to stop striking her with the pillow and told him she was going to contact the police.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov where Elza was striking her with the pillow to which, she advised &amp;quot;he took it like he was like pillow fighting me. But he&amp;#39;s alot stronger than me.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov began to cry again. I asked&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov if he did anything beyond striking her with the pillow.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov advised when she had her phone and told Elza she was going to call the police he demanded her phone. She stated Elza put his knee on top of her to hold her down and took her phone from her.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov attempted to grab her phone back from Elza.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov added &amp;quot;and then we were in the hallway and he&amp;#39;s like on top of me.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov explained while Elza was on top of her, the hood of her sweatshirt was over the entirety of the front of her face.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated she said &amp;quot;David I need to you let go because I can&amp;#39;t breathe.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I asked&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov what usually causes the arguments to which, she advised Elza&amp;#39;s drinking.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated &amp;quot;and he&amp;#39;s gonna sit there and say that I started it.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov pulled her hair back, began to cry and stated &amp;quot;I have marks on my neck from him grabbing me.&amp;quot; I observed scratch marks and redness around the front and sides of&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov&amp;#39;s neck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Pater-Rov advised Elza and her have one child together, Luca Carter Elza (DOB: 12/27/2021 2/M). I explained the MSP 246 - Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report to&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov and informed her I would be retrieving it from my patrol vehicle.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated &amp;quot;My thing is like I&amp;#39;m tired of him putting his hands on me and like I have these recordings of him like the way he treats me. And like and I do it to protect myself in a way. And to also hope and pray that one day if I can catch a sober moment out of him and be like. This is who you are when you drink.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov advised she wanted Elza to be sober not just for himself but also for their son.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated she has known Elza since she was 15 years old. I asked&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov how long they have been in a relationship to which, she advised approximately since 2017/2018.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I retrieved the MSP Form 246 and reentered the residence. I asked&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov if she could explain to me how they ended up on the floor again.&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov stated when they were both in bed, and she had told him to keep his hands off of her of she&amp;#39;ll call the police, Elza went over to her side of the bed and tried to grab her phone. &amp;quot;And as he did that. We kinda like. I was trying to hold onto my phone. So we&amp;#39;re like wrestling, and we ended up onto the floor. But my. When this wasn&amp;#39;t zipped up he had my hoodie over my head like my. And my phone and his hands were like underneath of me, and he was on top of me on the floor like going like this.&amp;quot; The hand gestures&amp;nbsp;Pater-Rov used to describe Ezla&amp;#39;s actions appeared to be as if she was being smothered and her airway was restricted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I completed the MSP 246 - Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report with Pater-Rov. Pater-Rov screened high-danger based on officer belief.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TFC Wantz placed Ezla under arrest and transported him to the Maryland State Police Bel Air Barracks for processing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Pater-Rov was referred to the Harford County Court Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office to file appropriate paperwork for a peace/protective order.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Harford County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
