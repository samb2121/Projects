         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On 1/15/2023 at 1843 hours I was dispatched to 20315 Lower Georges Creek RD Barton MD in reference to a domestic assault. Upon my arrival I spoke with Renea Hart-Gaither. She stated that she and her live in boyfriend, Andrew Romack were involved in a domestic argument. She stated that she overdosed last week accidentally, because her friend gave her a wrong pill that was found to be fentanyl. She stated that Andrew was mad at her and accusing her of being a drug addict. She stated that he drank an entire fifth of whiskey and was drunk and angry. She stated that during their argument while she was sitting on the couch, Andrew stood up and began to strangle her until she almost lost consciousness. She then stated that he placed his thumb into the side of her neck towards her jugular stating that it could kill her. She stated that Andrew then began to slap her face several times, and she stated that he hit her on the scalp. I asked her what he hit her with, and she made a fist with her finger knuckles sticking out and advised he hit her on the scalp with his finger knuckles and advised that he said that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave any marks. She stated that he also punched her in the stomach and she said that she just had a hysterectomy several days ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cpl Brinkman stated that when he first arrived on scene he saw a visible red mark that appeared to be a thumb mark on her neck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hart stated that she then kicked Andrew in the &amp;ldquo;nuts&amp;rdquo; and then kicked him again in his bad knee. She stated that he then took her cellphone, but she took it from his back pocket while he was leaving. She stated that he then took the keys to both her vehicles, leaving in the Nissan Pathfinder that was registered to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While I was on scene, Andrew had arrived and the Allegany County Sheriffs Office. Deputy on scene advised that Andrew stated that he was shot at.&amp;nbsp;I then asked Hart if she fired a weapon, she stated that she did have her .22 caliber rifle that she shot into the air off the porch. She then said that she fired it into the tree in the yard while Andrew was already in the vehicle driving down the road a ways. She then stated that Andrew took a 10mm pistol and a .45 caliber pistol with him from the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Due to the nature of the domestic and ERPOs, all of the firearms were taken from the scene. Twenty-seven (27) firearms were taken from the residence and taken to the Cumberland Barracks. MSP paperwork was completed for the firearms and included in the case file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I then spoke with Andrew Romack at the Cumberland Barracks, he was read his Miranda Rights and he agreed to waive them. While speaking with Andrew he stated that Hart is a long time heroin and pill abuser, and stated she overdosed just a few days prior. He stated that starting this morning at about 8 in the morning she began drinking beer and smoking marijuana, he advised that she had about 3 beers before 9 in the morning and she continued that pace during the day. Andrew stated that Hart was &amp;ldquo;jonesing&amp;rdquo; for a fix today and was uneasy all day. Hart left the house at about 3 in the afternoon and stated she was going to go to Fox&amp;rsquo;s pizza to pick up wings. Andrew stated that she arrived at 5 in the afternoon but did not have wings. She brought back chicken for the dog chow and dinner, from her work place at Best Price in McCoole. Andrew stated that she usually gets her drugs from her workplace. He stated that he told Hart to de-bone the chicken and she shoved him into the living room. Hart then claimed she could not finish and did not know how to work the burners on the oven. Andrew stated that Hart then went into the living room while he went in the kitchen preparing the dog chow, and dinner for them. At this point the argument escalated and he went back into the living room. Andrew claimed that Hart then kicked him in the &amp;ldquo;nuts&amp;rdquo; and knee. He claimed that he held her legs down to keep her from kicking him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is a mark on Andrew&amp;rsquo;s neck on the left side that appears to be a scrape. Andrew did not know where it came from but stated it could have happened while she was kicking him. Andrew then told Hart he is finished and walked into the bedroom to put his clothes on to leave the house. Andrew said that he keeps a .45 caliber Ruger revolver in the cabinet in the kitchen. He said that Hart took that weapon and pointed it at him with the hammer cocked. Andrew stated that he keeps that firearm loaded. He stated that she kept him at gun point while he was leaving the home and when he walked outside towards the vehicle, that she fired the guns towards him. He then left the scene, and drove to the Allegany County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office. He did not call 911.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Before speaking with Andrew, I performed SFST and observed no clues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ERPO&amp;#39;s were completed on both Andrew and Renea. Both Andrew and Renea were also charged in the incident.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case closed by arrest&lt;br /&gt; All above incidents occurred in Allegany County Maryland.</NarrativeText>
