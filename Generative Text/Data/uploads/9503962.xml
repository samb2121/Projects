         <NarrativeText>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 2/21/2023 at approximately 1320 hours, M/Tpr. Hood and Sgt. Roberts were patrolling in the area of Johnathan Street and Church Street, Hagerstown, MD. This area is a known drug trafficking area known for hand-to-hand drug transactions and was the target of numerous Hagerstown City CDS cases. The particular area has been patrolled heavily due to the amount of complaints by citizens about the suspected drug dealing. On the given date and time, M/Tpr. Hood and Sgt. Roberts observed several unknown males standing around the corner. At this time a red Nissan Sentra bearing Maryland registration 4DJ4150 pulled onto the parking lot. The vehicle was being driven by an unknown white female and pulled into the parking lot at the given location. It was at this time, one of the unknown males walked over to the driver&amp;#39;s window of the Nissan and conducted a hand-to-hand drug transaction. M/Tpr. Hood has witnesses numerous hand-to-hand transactions and completed them in an undercover capacity. M/Tpr. Hood was able to identify this interaction as the same. After approximately 3 seconds the male walked away from the Nissan and the driver pulled out of the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; M/Tpr. Hood then followed the vehicle for approximately 2 miles before the driver pulled over on the shoulder of Potomac Street in the two hundred block. Due to the fact that M/Tpr. Hood and Sgt. Roberts felt the driver was pulling over to use the CDS recently purchased contact was made with the driver. The female driver immediately placed a blue &amp;ldquo;trash can&amp;rdquo; in between her legs and was then advised to exit the vehicle. M/Tpr. Hood then watched the female later identified by her Maryland driver&amp;#39;s license as Shannon Lee Holton DOB 2/8/1971 throw the same blue &amp;ldquo;trash can&amp;rdquo; on the floor near the gas pedal. Holton was then asked if she was in possession of anything else and she advised she was not. Due to M/Tpr. Hood&amp;#39;s training and experience as a Maryland State Trooper he was able to identify the white rock substance inside the &amp;ldquo;trash can&amp;rdquo; as suspected crack cocaine. A probable cause search of the vehicle was then conducted by Sgt. Roberts and the only other item of value located was a glass smoking device &amp;ldquo;crack pipe&amp;rdquo; in the driver&amp;#39;s side door pocket. Holton freely and willingly admitted that she just paid $10.00 for the suspected crack cocaine. Holton advised, she didn&amp;#39;t know the dealers name and that she just pulls up to the parking lot and someone will serve her. However, Holton was able to provide information pertaining to another crack cocaine dealer in the Hagerstown area. Holton was issued a criminal citation for the possession of CDS not marijuana and released from the scene.Follow up on the information provided will be completed by M/Tpr. Hood.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All the above events occurred in Washington County Maryland.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CASE STATUS: I request this case be closed.&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
