         <NarrativeText>DIGITAL EVIDENCE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This interaction was audibly and visually recorded on my Axon III Body Worn Camera.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On October 6, 2023, at approximately 0641 hours, I, Trooper Barrientos #7396, responded to the barrack in report of a harassment.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At approximately 0145 hours, Nicole Marie Colegrove (W/F DOB: 11/10/1983) arrived to the Prince Frederick Barrack to request a witness statement form and exited the barrack. At approximately 0618 hours, Colegrove returned to the barrack and was very upset. Colegrove provided Sgt. Evans #5156 a written statement form, then proceeded to exit the barrack while yelling and screaming.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At approximately 0655 hours, I contacted Colegrove through the recorded phone line at the Prince Frederick Barrack. Colegrove advised that she wanted an investigation to be conducted by the Maryland State Police in regard to her being a victim of harassment, but Colegrove was not sure who exactly was harassing her. Colegrove believes that someone is locking her vehicle keys inside her vehicle, which has caused her to call the Calvert County Sheriffs Office for assistance in gaining entry to her vehicle. Colegrove also stated that there have been several items missing and damaged from her residence at 4450 Lancaster Drive, Saint Leonard MD, 20685, such as jewelry, driver&amp;#39;s license, and clothes, but does not know who the person may be. Colegrove stated that only her items specifically have been missing or damaged such as a hole being cut on her comforter. Colegrove stated that her ex-husband, Brian Justin Colegrove (W/M DOB: 11/11/1975) works for T-Mobile. N. Colegrove stated that B. Colegrove is accessing her personal information on her cell phone through B. Colegrove&amp;#39;s job at T-Mobile. N. Colegrove stated that her phone has &amp;quot;re-routed&amp;quot; calls and has lost internet connection multiple times. N. Colegrove stated that when making a phone call on her cellphone, the call would re-route to a different phone number than the one she intended to call. N. Colegrove also stated that B. Colegrove owns a firearm and that it is located somewhere in the residence. N. Colegrove stated that she has never seen the firearm, but believes that B. Colegrove may have one. N. Colegrove stated that B. Colegrove does not reside with her. N. Colegrove stated that she lives at her residence of 4450 Lancaster Drive with her three children, Hayden Colegrove (W/F DOB: 05/06/2009), Avery Colegrove (W/F DOB: 04/25/2011), and Nicholas Alderson (W/M DOB: 05/05/1999). B. Colegrove is the father of Avery Colegrove and Hayden Colegrove. It should be noted that when speaking with N. Colegrove, she became upset over the phone and began to cry multiple times. N. Colegrove advised she did not have any evidence at the moment, but that she would be able to provide evidence on Monday, October 9, 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At approximately 0857 hours, I made contact with B. Colegrove via telephone call. B. Colegrove advised that he was out of state visiting family in Texas, and would return on Monday, October 9, 2023. B. Colegrove advised he currently resides with his mother at 6059 Hill Road, Saint Leonard MD 20658 due to his divorce from N. Colegrove in April 2023. B. Colegrove advised that his ex-wife, N. Colegrove, has been acting extremely paranoid and has accused him of hacking into her cell-phone. B. Colegrove stated that she has been acting this way for about two years. B. Colegrove advised that N. Colegrove has threatened suicide multiple times. B. Colegrove advised that their children feel stressed due to N. Colegrove&amp;#39;s behavior. B. Colegrove advised that he is a project manager for T-Mobile which is not a technical position, and that he has not gained access to N. Colegrove&amp;#39;s phone. B. Colegrove stated that N. Colegrove has asked to remove herself from their family cell phone plan due to her suspicions, and N. Colegrove later asked B. Colegrove to be placed back into the family plan. B. Colegrove advised that he and N. Colgrove have joint custody of Hayden and Avery where B. Colegrove obtains custody every other weekend and on Wednesday evenings. B. Colegrove advised that N. Colegrove accused him of harassment when B. Colegrove blocked incoming messages from N. Colegrove. B. Colegrove stated that he has not harassed N. Colegrove, and that N.Colgrove has changed her cell phone and cell phone number multiple times due to her suspicions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At approximately 0930 hours, N. Colegrove arrived to the Prince Frederick Barrack to present her evidence. It should be noted that during the time leading up to N. Colegrove arriving to the barrack, N. Colegrove called the Prince Frederick Barrack multiple times stating that nobody is helping her and that she would like to retract her written statement. N. Colegrove became verbally upset over the phone and would consistently talk over the Duty Officer (DO), Cpl. Palumbo #5974. Upon her arrival, N. Colegrove was escorted to the Trooper&amp;#39;s room for further interview. N. Colegrove displayed multiple photos on her cell phone. N. Colegrove stated that the photos were of B. Colegrove&amp;#39;s work notebook containing work and login information for his work accounts. N. Colegrove believes that B. Colegrove is gaining access to her personal information by using his work login account to hack her cellphone. N. Colegrove stated that the vehicle manufacturer Dodge has a partnership with T-Mobile, and N. Colegrove advised that she believes B. Colegrove tracks the location of her vehicle (2017 Dodge bearing MD registration 4MD6159) due to his employment with T-Mobile. N. Colegrove advised that she hired a private investigator to investigate her suspicions of being hacked, but did not know any identifying information about the private investigator. N. Colegrove advised that she believes someone entered her residence and caused several appliances to stop working such as the refrigerator, laundry washer, and dishwasher, but has no evidence of this occurring. N. Colegrove again stated that someone is placing her car keys inside her vehicle on purpose and also stated that Sheriff Cox of the Calvert County Sheriffs Office was her suspect. When asked for evidence of this incident, N. Colegrove stated that her residence was equipped with cameras from ADT, but was unable to provide any video evidence due to her not knowing how to operate the cameras.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At approximately 0951 hours, the Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) was requested for assistance in speaking with N. Colegrove as she seemed frustrated during our conversation. At approximately 1011 hours, MCT arrived to the barrack. MCT attempted to calm N. Colegrove down and offer their services, but N. Colegrove refused. N. Colegrove exited the barrack at approximately 1048 hours.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; It should be noted that on 09/25/2022, during an interaction with the Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) (Reference 22-MSP-037359), N. Colegrove told MCT that Dr. Saleh, from Prince Frederick, diagnosed Colegrove with Schizophrenia and Bi-polar disorder.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On October 6, 2023, at approximately 1030 hours, Detective Sergeant Hunt #5162, made contact with Child Protective Services due to the nature of N. Colegrove&amp;#39;s mental state.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There was no evidence to support N. Colegrove&amp;#39;s claims, and it appears that she may have mental health issues.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On October 16, 2023, I spoke to N. Colegrove via telephone call, where I advised her of the status and told her that she could file her own charges at the Commissioners Office. N. Colegrove became upset and hung up. It should be noted that N. Colegrove had called the Prince Frederick Barrack several times and yelled at the Duty Officer (DO) and Police Communications Officer (PCO) in reference to these accusations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed due to lack of evidence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.</NarrativeText>
