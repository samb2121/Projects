         <NarrativeText>Incident Type: Verbal Argument&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On 01-03-2023 at 1725 hours I, TFC. Norfolk 7120 responded to 214 Morris Drive Salisbury MD 21801 for a 911 hang up. The Duty Officer heard an extreme amount of screaming and commotion in the background of the call.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I arrived at the scene and met with the property owner identified as Ann Richardson. Richardson advised that her roommate identified as Betty Burgess had her son over at the above listed residence for a conversation. The son was identified as Robert Manning Burgess. Betty advised me that her son came over to the house in his car along with his girlfriend identified as Lindsey Cutchin. Betty sated that due to previous altercations with Robert&amp;#39;s girlfriend she was not allowed on the property. Robert obliged and parked his car on the street and left Cuthcin inside the car, so he could speak with his mother about a recent family matter. Once Robert and Betty were inside the residence talking they heard the horn of a car blowing from outside the residence, and they see that Cutchin had driven the car up the driveway and was now irate and screaming at everyone on the property. Cutchin was taken out of the car by Robert at which point she called 911 and was hysterical on the phone while trying to talk to the Duty Officer. Cutchin got back into the passenger seat of the vehicle after a verbal argument occurred and then Robert drove the vehicle and Cutchin off the property before police arrival. Cuthcin does not have any trespassing orders or Protective orders placed against her by anyone involved in this incident. No assault took place just a verbal argument. Betty was advised on how to apply for a peace order against Cutchin for this incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All events occurred in Wicomico County MD 21801&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be closed&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Case Closed&amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
