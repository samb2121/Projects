         <NarrativeText>&lt;strong&gt;Case Number: &lt;/strong&gt;23-MSP-014049&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Suspect&lt;/strong&gt;: Devron Duane Johnson&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; DOB:11/03/1993&lt;br /&gt; Address:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; 325 McMechen St. Apt. 101, Baltimore City, MD. 21217&lt;br /&gt; 1516 Eutaw Place Apt. 301 Bolton Hill, Baltimore City, MD. 21217&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Victim:&lt;/strong&gt; Javonnie Andrea Earley&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; DOB: 12/19/2006&lt;br /&gt; Address: 109 Bridgeport Cove Dr. hampton VA. 23616&lt;br /&gt; Phone Number: 757-401-7124 (mother&amp;#39;s phone number)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Narrative:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On 4/20/2023 I responded to the Lower Eastern Shore Children&amp;#39;s Center in reference to a possible sexual assault of a minor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I arrived on scene and made contact with Jessica Chase who is a social worker at the Children&amp;#39;s Center. While speaking with Jessica, she informed that a juvenile, Javonnie Andrea Earley (12/19/2006), had spoken with her and informed her of a possible sexual assault. I then made contact with Earley and interviewed her about the matter. Earley provided Mrs. Chase with a detailed three-page written statement about her sexual encounter with multiple men. A copy of the written statement is listed under &amp;quot;attachments&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Earley informed me that on March 26th, she had gotten into an argument with her boyfriend, identified only as &amp;quot;Kai&amp;quot; who is a 22 year old man. Kai resides in the state of Virginia. Earley informed Kai that she wanted to break up with him and meet another boyfriend of hers that resided in Baltimore Maryland that she had met on a dating app called &amp;quot;Scout&amp;quot; whose name is Devron Duane Johnson (11/03/1993). Kai stated that he would drive her there to meet him. Earley had not gotten the permission from her mother, Felecia Earley, to go to Baltimore to meet Johnson. Kai and Earley drove to 1516 Eutaw Pl. Bolton Hill, Baltimore City, MD. 21217 to Johnson&amp;#39;s mother&amp;#39;s residence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Earely stated that she engaged in sexual relations with Johnson many times, and every time they did it was consensual. I asked Earley if she was ever forced or pressured to use drugs before engaging in sexual activities, and she stated that she smoked weed many times during her stay there, but did it very willingly. Earley stated that she took &amp;quot;molly&amp;quot; one time when she was there, and she stated that it did not have much of an effect on her and she was still able to fully consent to sex. Earley stated that she did not have sexual relations with anyone but Johnson throughout her stay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Earley also informed me of a friend of Johnson who is identified only as &amp;quot;Tamika&amp;quot;. I asked Johnson if she knew anything else about Tamika, but she stated the only other think she knew about her was that she was a stripper at a club. Earley stated that Tamika was at the house with her and Johnson for a large portion of her time there and also had a boyfriend of her own there. Earley stated that one night when she wa asleep, possibly 3/28, an individual who she thought was Johnson began rubbing her buttox. Earley stated that she remembered feeling it, thinking it was Johnson, and being okay with it and going back to sleep. The following day, she was informed by Johnson it was not him and it was Tamika. Earley stated she never actually saw who it was, but she did not consent to Tamika making sexual advances on her.&amp;nbsp;Earley later stated that Tamika made multiple sexual advances towards her, including offering to have a &amp;quot;4 some&amp;quot; with the two dating couples, and&amp;nbsp;Earley declined those advances. I asked&amp;nbsp;Earley if she was ever assaulted by Tamika and she stated no, other than the unconfirmed time that Tamika rubbed her buttox. Tamika also offered to get&amp;nbsp;Earley a job as a stripper at the strip club that she worked at, but&amp;nbsp;Earley stated that this raised a red flag, and she declined to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I later asked&amp;nbsp;Earley if any of her and Johnson&amp;#39;s sexual encounters were recorded, and she stated that they were.&amp;nbsp;Earley stated that on three separate occasions, her and Johnson recorded a sex video. Johnson stated that one of the three times she was engaged in oral sex with Johnson, and the other times they were actually engaged in sexual intercourse.&amp;nbsp;Earley stated that both she and Johnson had the video&amp;#39;s, but she has since deleted the videos, and she was not sure if Johnson had done the same.&amp;nbsp;Earley informed me she was not sure if Johnson had sent the videos to anyone, but she had never asked.&amp;nbsp;Earley stated that she consented to all the videos being taken, and she had also sent him naked photographs of herself. She did not advise the amount of photographs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Earley informed me that on 4/17 she had gotten into an argument with Johnson and Tamika and informed them that she wanted to leave. Neither Johnson or Tamika wanted her to leave according to her, so she ran to the closest fire department and reported herself to the police. At this time, police revealed that she was currently wanted out of the state of Virginia for being a runaway so she was apprehended and transported to Salisbury where there was an available spot for her with Children&amp;#39;s Center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I attempted to inform Earley the dangers of being trafficked and corresponding with significantly older men at the young age of 16. I also informed Earley that the production and distribution of child pornography is illegal intoe state of Maryland, and to cease such actions immediately. I informed Earley that she may be contacted in the coming days about future updates with the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I made contact with Officer Roman #J929 with the Baltimore Police Department and advised him of the facts of the case. Officer Roman informed me that he was going to contact an investigator and relay the information and they may have additional contact with me in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case be suspended with the information relayed to the proper agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All events occurred in Wicomico County.</NarrativeText>
