         <NarrativeText>TYPE OF REPORT: - Fatal Overdose-&lt;br /&gt; MSP CASE #: 23-MSP-018587&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; DATE: 05/25/2023&lt;br /&gt; TIME: 0657 hrs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; NARRATIVE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On Thursday, May 25th 2023 at approximately 0657 hrs. I (TFC. Davis #7043) responded to 12506 Deer Point Circle in Berlin or the report of CPR in progress. I was advised that EMS was en route. Upon my arrival I made contact with EMS personnel who advised that they were still administering CPR to the female and that they had additionally administered Narcan in an attempt to revive the patient. I was able to identify the patient as Katherine Higgins (DOB: 08/21/1982&amp;nbsp; W/F).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The homeowner Shelia Housar stated that Higgins was supposed to pick up James Sullivan who also lives at the residence around 0600hrs from the Atlantic Club in West Ocean City. Sullivan stated that he had talked to Higgins on the phone at 0500 hours, and she told Sullivan that she would be there at 0600 to pick him up. I spoke with Sullivan who stated that Higgins never showed up at 0600 and that he called her several times. Sullivan stated that he eventually got a ride home from another employee. Sullivan stated that he and Housar then went upstairs to find Higgins unresponsive on the floor of her room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Higgins was pronounced deceased at 0724 hrs. and the medical examiner as contacted.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, because of Higgins age and MSP policy CED was also contacted and M/Tpr. Brant responded to the scene as well to continue the investigation. Higgins was removed by Burbage Funeral home and was transported to the medical examiner&amp;#39;s office in Baltimore. Any further investigation in this case will be done by M/Tpr. Brant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All above events occurred in Worcester County Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

Name: Higgins, Kathrine, Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Race: White Sex: &amp;nbsp;Female&lt;br /&gt; Date of Birth: &amp;nbsp;08/21/1982&lt;br /&gt; Address: 12506 Deer Point Circle, Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland 21811.&lt;br /&gt;

*(1) Compact Disc containing fifty-three (53) fifty-three photographs of Kathrine Elizabeth Higgins&amp;#39; body and the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt; - Storage Location: Attached to case file.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Narrative&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On Thursday, May 25, 2023, at approximately 0657 hours [6:57 a.m.], Troopers from the Maryland State Police Belin Barrack were dispatched to respond to 12506 Deer Point Circle, Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland 21811, regarding a death investigation. &amp;nbsp;I, Master Trooper James Brant #4827 assigned to the Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division Eastern Region (CEDER) was contacted to assume the investigation, due to the age of the deceased and the indication of possible use of controlled dangerous substances. &amp;nbsp;In addition, Detective Christopher Welch of the Worcester County Criminal Enforcement Team (CET) was also contacted to respond. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Upon arrival, I learned that the victim, Kathryn Elizabeth Higgins, [hereinafter referred to as &amp;ldquo;Higgins&amp;rdquo;] was found to be unresponsive on 05/25/23 at approximately 0640 hours [6:40 a.m.], by Higgins&amp;rsquo; friend, James Paul Sullivan, [hereinafter referred to as &amp;ldquo;Sullivan&amp;rdquo;]. &amp;nbsp;On 05/25/2023 at approximately 0724 hours [7:24 a.m.], Higgins was pronounced deceased by Paramedic David Peterson of the Ocean City Fire Department Emergency Medical Services (EMS). &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I contacted and interviewed Sullivan. &amp;nbsp;During the interview, Sullivan advised that on 05/25/23 at approximately 0640 hours [6:40 a.m.], he found Higgins to be unresponsive, in which Higgins was laying face down on the floor of her living quarters, which is a room above the garage for the residence of 12506 Deer Point Circle, Berlin, Worcester County, Maryland 21811. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that he rolled Higgins over to her left side and noticed vomit on her face and the floor of Higgins living quarters. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that he observed that Higgins had no pulse and was not breathing; Sullivan advised that upon his observation of Higgins, 911 was called immediately. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that the last time he had contact with Higgins was on 05/25/2023 at approximately 0500 hours [5:00 a.m.]. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that Higgins called him by cellular phone and told him that she would pick him up from his place of work at approximately 0600 hours [6:00 a.m.]. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that he works at the Atlantic Club located in Berlin, Maryland, which is a facility that helps people who battle with substance abuse. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that around the approximate time frame of 0600 hours [6:00 a.m.], Higgins did not show up at the Atlantic Club, in which Sullivan advised that he tried calling Higgins several times, but she did not answer. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that he received a ride from the Atlantic Club, back to his residence, and upon arrival he went to Higgins&amp;rsquo; living quarters and that is when he found her to be unresponsive. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that the last time he saw Higgins to be alive was on 05/24/2023 at approximately 2200 hours [10:00 p.m.], when she dropped him off at the Atlantic Club. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that several years ago, he met Higgins at the Atlantic Club and has known her (Higgins) for the duration. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that approximately two (2) weeks ago, Higgins was released from a drug treatment facility located in the state of Pennsylvania. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that Higgins was provided the living quarters above the garage, until she could get her personal affairs in order. &amp;nbsp;Sullivan advised that in the several years he has known Higgins, she suffered from heroin addiction and depression. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; During scene processing, I observed and seized items that appeared to be controlled dangerous substances and drug paraphernalia (white wax wrapper labeled in red lettering &amp;ldquo;Kit Kat&amp;rdquo; and suspected marijuana). The controlled dangerous substances and drug paraphernalia was ultimately placed into the Maryland State Police Berlin Barrack Property Room, in which an MSP 67 Chain of Custody Form was established for the items. &amp;nbsp;The MSP 67 Chain of Custody Form will be attached to the case file. &amp;nbsp;Detective Christopher Welch from the Worcester County Criminal Enforcement Team (CET) collected and seized the electronic devices. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; The on-scene Forensic Examiner, Lawrence Towles and I conducted a preliminary examination of Higgins&amp;rsquo; body, no signs of injuries or trauma were observed. &amp;nbsp;In addition, no signs or indications of foul play were observed at Higgins&amp;rsquo; living quarters. &amp;nbsp;The Forensic Examiner advised that Higgins body will be transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for autopsy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Due to the above facts, this investigation is OPEN, pending autopsy report from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Case OPEN. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
