         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In-car camera operational, T-5; incident not captured. This incident was captured on a Body Worn Camera.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Scene Processing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I arrived on scene and observed two bruises on Shumate&amp;rsquo;s left arm. I obtained thirteen digital photographs and attached them to this report. I completed a Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report for Shumate, which is attached to this report. Jager was located and was transported to MedStar St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s Hospital by TFC Pope. A Petition for Emergency Evaluation was completed, and a copy is attached to this report. A Maryland Gun Center Case Report was made and attached to this report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attachments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thirteen (13) Digital photographs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One (1) Petition for Emergency Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One (1) Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplement Report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On February 23, 2023 at approximately 1137&amp;nbsp;hours, Tpr. Crump #7571 and I, were on duty, operating my unmarked patrol vehicle, T-5.&amp;nbsp; We responded to a reported domestic with an assault, located at 49830 Airedele Rd, Ridge, MD, 20680. Upon arrival, Tpr. Crump made contact with Catherine Alicia Shumate (W/F, DOB: 12/04/1971) Shumate was identified by her Maryland Driver&amp;rsquo;s License, who was standing outside, in the driveway. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Shumate advised she and Matthew Robert Jager (W/M, DOB: 06/19/1988) had been working on a house over the past few days. Shumate advised she went to the residence at approximately 1045 hours to see how the flooring they were installing was progressing. Shumate stated, when she arrived at the residence, there were only a few pieces of flooring installed, and she asked Jager to leave, due to the short amount of progress. Shumate asked Jager to leave multiple times, which led to Jager becoming agitated. Shumate stated Jager had been drinking for three days straight, and he had not been getting any work done. Shumate stated Jager would not leave, and this led to Jager raising his voice and chasing her from the sun room to the living room. Shumate advised, in the living room, Jager grabbed a piece of wood and threatened to hit her with it. Shumate advised Jager put the wood down and grabbed her by the left arm with both of his hands, twisted it, placed it down on his leg, and tried to break her arm with his knee. Shumate advised she was able to get away from Jager, and she ran out of the living room, to the sun room, where she exited the residence. Shumate advised Jager followed her out of the house, and Jager threw her phone into the yard. Shumate stated Jager then swung, and broke, a long piece of wood on the corner of the house, causing the wood to break. Shumate advised Jager grabbed a DeWalt table saw from the back of the truck, which was parked in the driveway, and he threw it in her direction. Shumate stated the table saw did not strike her. Shumate advised Jager proceeded to pick up a crab trap, which was next to the residence, and he acted like he was going to throw it at the boat, which was on the side of the house. Shumate grabbed her phone to call 9-1-1, and Jager left in his blue, Toyota Highlander, bearing a Maryland registration 9EK2056. Shumate advised Jager returned shortly after, and she ran to the back of the residence to hide her purse, because she was scared Jager would try to take money from her for gas. Shumate stated Jager went into the residence and left in the Toyota Highlander again. Shumate advised she came from the back of the residence to the side yard when Jager was leaving the residence. Shumate stated Jager saw her standing in the side yard, and he stopped at the end of the driveway. He got out of the vehicle. He threw his hands in the air, yelling. He then got back in the vehicle and proceeded northbound on Airedele Rd. I asked Shumate to show me where Jager grabbed her. I observed two notable bruises on her left arm, one on her inner bicep and one on her inner forearm. Shumate advised she did not need any medical attention and refused to be seen by EMS. Shumate advised she has been in a relationship with Jager for approximately two years and eight months. Shumate stated Jager currently works for her as a contractor. Shumate stated she does not have any children in common with Jager. Shumate stated, Jager does live with her, but she is going to make him move out after this incident. Shumate advised there is one previous indecent of a domestic dispute between her and Jager, which was handled by the St. Mary&amp;#39;s County Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Tpr. Crump then asked Shumate if she knew where Jager was going. Shumate provided an address of another client&amp;rsquo;s residence, 14751 Eisenhower Way. TFC Pope #7286 and Tpr. Quinn #7583 of the Maryland State Police, responded to the address. Upon arrival, they made contact with Jager. Shumate advised that Jager had been threatening to harm himself by running his car into a wall or cutting his hand off with the DeWalt table saw. TFC Pope confirmed that Jager said he was going to cut his hand off with the table saw. TFC Pope transported Jager to MedStar St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s Hospital&amp;nbsp;of an emergency petition at approximately 1230 hours. Tpr. Crump completed a Maryland State Police Domestic Violence Supplemental Report for Shumate, which is attached to this report. Shumate screened as a &amp;ldquo;High Danger,&amp;rdquo; and spoke with a Counselor at approximately 1250 hours.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At approximately 1342 hours, Tpr. Crump and I responded to&amp;nbsp;MedStar St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s Hospital&amp;nbsp;and made contact with Jager. Tpr. Crump asked Jager what happened, and Jager stated he was at the residence working on the floor and told Shumate not to come. Jager advised Shumate arrived at approximately 1030 hours. Jager stated he asked Shumate to leave. At approximately 1346 hours, Jager said he did not want to speak with Tpr. Crump, and he asked for a lawyer. Tpr. Crump detected the odor of alcohol while speaking with Jager; however, he did not appear to be intoxicated at the time of contact. I completed a Petition for Emergency Evaluation on Jager, which is attached to this report. Jager was released to the care and custody of the Emergency Room staff. Additionally, I completed an application for charges for Assault Second Degree on Jager, which was submitted to the District Court Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office for review.&amp;nbsp;No firearms were mentioned during the Domestic Dispute and statements of self-harm. The Maryland Gun Center was contacted, and it was advised Jager had no firearms registered in his name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Shumate and Jager have a history of one (1) prior domestic disturbance.&amp;nbsp; Shumate was advised how to obtain a protective order, how to obtain a free copy of this report, and she was provided a Victim/Witness Pamphlet with the case number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Case remains open, pending Application of Charges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All events occurred in St. Mary&amp;#39;s County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
