The victim had reported to the urgent care with visible injuries and police were called by Patient First due to the nature of the injuries. Baltimore City Police responded initially and contacted the Maryland State Police JFK Barrack to conduct the investigation due to where the incident occurred. I made contact with the victim, identified as Shanta Michelle Lara-Navarrete (Hispanic/Female DOB: 09/26/1989).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Navarrete advised that she and her boyfriend were leaving from a party that morning in Harford County between approximately 0200 and 0400 hours. As they were leaving an argument ensued over the boyfriend cheating on her. Navarrete then advised that the boyfriend forced her into the car and he began driving towards Baltimore County. While in the vehicle, the argument became physical with Navarrete&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend punching her in the head, face, and arms and reaching across and choking her. At one point Naverrete struck him with her wallet in the mouth.&amp;nbsp; Navarrete attempted to exit the vehicle 3 times while the vehicle was in motion, opening the passenger door and putting her leg out to jump out. Each time Naverrete attempted to exit the vehicle, her boyfriend would stop the car, Navarrete would exit the vehicle, and her boyfriend would grab her by the hair or clothes, and drag her back in the vehicle. The third time that Naverrete exited the vehicle, the boyfriend shoved her back in the car, activated the child lock on the door, and held her head and neck down against the center console with his elbow. The boyfriend then drove Naverrete to her apartment complex at 1150 Crossroads Circle in Middle River, where Navarrete exited the vehicle and ran to her vehicle in the parking garage. Navarrete advised that she believed based on her surroundings the events occurred on Interstate 95 but could not advise which county, or any approximate exits or mile markers. I observed signs of physical injury of Navarette to include: bruising on the face, neck, arms, and legs; abrasions on the arms, legs, back, and neck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Naverrete was unwilling to provide the identity of her boyfriend or any contact information which would help locate him. She only stated that he was a Hispanic male and lived either in Havre De Grace or in North East, Maryland. Navarrete stated that she had homes in Perryville Maryland and Middle River. She stated that the boyfriend had never been inside either dwelling but knew where they were, and that she would occasionally go to his place but would never stay the night. Navarrete states she had been together with her boyfriend for approximately 5 months and stated that he had physically assaulted her approximately 25 times in this period but had never reported any assault to the police.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Navarette refused to answer questions from the lethality screening or to speak to a hotline representative which was offered by both myself and Baltimore City Police. I again asked for Navarrete&amp;rsquo;s cooperation in identifying her boyfriend. Navarette was asked if she would provide a name, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers, places of employment, or vehicle information and she refused. She stated that she was fearful of retaliation of further aggression or her life if she reported his name, or any information which might identify him. I searched Maryland Judiciary Case Search and found a divorce filing from 2018 between her and Carlos Yavani Lara Navarrete. There were no cases involving the two parties for domestic assault. I ran a TLO Browse for Carlos Navarrete and found no history of domestic assault in his criminal record. Navarrete was provided a Victims and Witnesses Pamphlet with a case number and my contact information if she wished to come forward with any information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on the severity of injuries and Navarrete&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to identify the assailant, or complete a domestic supplement form, I contacted the Sexual Assault Spousal Abuse Report Center (SARC) in Harford County, and provided Navarrete&amp;rsquo;s information and case number for the incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Events occurred in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Harford County, Maryland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to a lack of victim cooperation and a lack of investigative leads, I request this case be closed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
