         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scene processing:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; S/T Brown&amp;#39;s body worn camera was activated during the interview with the complainant/victim. Due to the nature of the crime photos were not taken. Several documents were collected from the victim and have been attached to this report under attachments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Summary:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; State Farm Insurance sales personnel, Chelsea Benton who works for Agent Fred Wheatley used the victim&amp;#39;s information without his consent to open a fraudulent renter&amp;#39;s policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 2/21/2023 at approximately 1553 hours I responded to 30240 Mount Vernon Road located in Princess Anne, Maryland for a report of possible identity theft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Upon arrival, I made contact with complainant/victim, Andrew Kyle Travers. Travers advised&amp;nbsp;State Farm Insurance sales personnel, Chelsea Nicole Benton&amp;nbsp;had opened a renter&amp;#39;s policy in his name and he knew nothing about the policy until he received an email receipt thanking him for the payment. Travers advised he never made any payments and the payment of $8.00 was paid using a card ending in 0104. Travers advised none of his cards end in that number. Travers stated he learned the policy number was 22-EE-C694-9 and was in his name. Travers advised he had contacted the State Farm Agent Fred Wheatley to advise him of the incident. Travers stated Wheatley advised him he would look into the incident however Travers stated he did not believe anything would be done because he had heard Wheatley was in a relationship with Benton and had moved her into a house he owns in Hebron, Maryland. Travers stated he only knew Benton through his wife and that she had quoted him an auto policy the end of 2022. Travers stated he had not received any other quotes from her and not sure why she opened the renter&amp;#39;s policy in his name on February 16, 2023. Travers stated he believes she may be doing this to several more people to possibly gain benefits of some sort through State Farm. Travers was able to provide a post made on Facebook by Benton&amp;#39;s mother which states several family members have received bills from State Farm which they should not have received. While speaking with Travers he provided me with a State Farm envelope which he had just received in the mail. The envelope contained Travers&amp;#39; name and address and the policy number to the policy he stated was opened fraudulently. Travers stated I could have the paperwork because he had no use for it. Travers advised at no time did he give permission to Benton to open the policy in his name. Travers also provided several incriminating text messages from Benton to his wife&amp;#39;s cell phone regarding Benton opening the policy. At this time, Travers was given the case number and advised to watch his credit report. Travers advised he was going to notify the credit bureaus just in case. Travers advised he would e-mail me screenshots of the conversations between his wife and Benton and also the screenshot of the Facebook post made by Benton&amp;#39;s mother. Travers also sent me the screenshot of the e-mail receipt showing when the policy was purchased.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;After speaking with Travers, I responded to the Princess Anne Barrack and contacted State Farm Customer Care and spoke with Kyla ID# VADVJ7 who was made aware of the incident. Kyla advised she had opened an underwriting investigation to look into the incident. While speaking with Kyla she advised it appeared the card that was used to pay for the policy belonged to Chelsea Benton and was charged $8.00.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 2/22/2023 at approximately 1620 hours I spoke to Javeria ID# VAASHC from State Farm Corporate Office in Bloomington, Illinois. Javeria advised an underwriting investigation had been opened and stated the complaint number was 1474649. Javeria advised this could take 7 to 10 days for someone to contact me regarding the incident. At this time I have not spoken to Benton or Wheatley, and therefore I request the case remain open for further investigation. All associated paperwork has been attached to this report under attachments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>

         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 2/28/2023 I received an email from Ashley Travers with an attachment that was sent out from State Farm on 2/17/2023. The attachment was a bill from State Farm of $96.00. On the bill, in the amount due section stated &amp;quot;See Note&amp;quot; then further down stated &amp;quot;payment is due by Billed Thru SFPP&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 3/2/2023 Ashley sent another email with another attachment which was a cancellation notice from State Farm. Ashley advised in her email that Andrew and herself never requested the cancellation because they never requested the policy in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 3/9/2023 I received an email from Andrew Travers who stated he had received a check from State Farm in the amount of $8.00. Andrew advised he never opened the account and therefore he had no intention on cashing the check of $8.00.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On 3/10/2023 at approximately 1200 hours I contacted the Somerset County State&amp;#39;s Attorney&amp;#39;s Office and spoke to State&amp;#39;s Attorney Wess Garner and advised him of the case. Garner advised he was unsure if much could be done on a criminal level without showing some type of monetary gain for Chelsea Benton. Garner advised State Farm Corporate Office should be the ones to look into the issue. I advised Garner I had already notified State Farm Corporate, and they had started an underwriting investigation on their end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At this time I spoke to State Farm Agent Fred Wheatley, whose office is located at 1507 Ritchie Highway Ste. 102 Arnold, Maryland. Wheatley advised Chelsea does work for him, and he was aware of the incident. Wheatley advised he looked into the incident and stated that Benton had quoted an auto policy for Ashley Travers. Wheatley then stated Benton had opened the renters&amp;#39; policy in hopes to lower the auto policy with a bundle package is what he was lead to believe. Wheatley advised he had told Benton she should not have opened the policy in Andrew Traverse name because at no time did she speak with Andrew Travers only his wife Ashley Travers. Wheatley advised Benton had told him Ashley Travers was aware and had even used cash app to send her the money to open the policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At this time I contacted Ashley Travers who stated she did not cash app Benton any money and never gave Benton permission to open a renters&amp;#39; policy. Ashley advised on February 16, 2023 Benton tried to call her. Ashley advised she never answered the call because she was in her child&amp;#39;s school for a program. Ashley stated when she left the school she saw a text message from Benton which read the following &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m about to write you a bullshit ass renters policy I&amp;#39;ll pay for it I just wanna get my policy in and go home for the day lol. It does&amp;#39;t effect anything at all.&amp;quot;. Ashley advised she told Andrew what Benton had done. The both said they then learned of other people she had also done this to, so they reported the incident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;After speaking with Ashley Travers, I contacted the Maryland Insurance Commission (410 468 2256) and spoke to Investigator Jeff Gross. Jeff was advised of the incident and asked if I could forward him the information through his email, so he could investigate it further.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At this time, no criminal charges will be filed against Benton, and therefore I request the case be closed. Jeff Gross has been given the case information for further investigation through the Maryland Insurance Commission. Andrew and Ashley Travers have been advised of case status. All attachments Ashley has sent to me by email have been attached to this report under attachments. Also attached to this report under attachments is the cell phone screenshot of text messages between Ashley and Benton. The report and attachments have been sent to Jeff Gross for further investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As of 3/11/2023 I have not received any calls from State Farm personnel regarding the underwriting investigation. Case closed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
