I arrived and contacted EMS first who advised that everyone on scene was not injured and did not want to be transported by EMS. I then went over to the at-fault vehicle, a red Toyota Camry bearing MD registration 5FF7935, and spoke to a Monica Shirelle Crockett (01/10/1982 1/F) who I believed to be the driver. I spoke to her briefly about towing the vehicle and she immediately became hostile and argumentative with me. When I asked her to retrieve her license and registration she did not go into the Camry, she instead walked up the street to a Silver Acura MDX bearing MD registration &amp;ldquo;8FA8277&amp;rdquo; and went inside the vehicle. I later discovered that both the Toyota and Acura were registered in her name and both belonged to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After speaking with the other driver, identified as Jonathan Stevens Lampert (10/27/1970 2/M), I again spoke to Crockett about the accident. I asked her if she could tell me what happened and she made a statement that was hard to understand but sounded like she said, &amp;ldquo;not much I can recall&amp;rdquo;. The statement did not make sense and I asked if she had already spoken to EMS or if she hit her head in the accident. She said she was going to talk to them in a minute and asked again what I needed. I talked to her for a few more minutes before another Trooper on scene advised that EMS had stated there was another person in the vehicle during the accident. I asked Crockett if someone else was in the vehicle and she did not answer and said everyone was fine. I again asked and she made the statement several more times before she finally advised that her 13-year-old daughter, Caidence Cook (03/22/2010 1/F) was in the vehicle and was sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle. I then asked if there was anyone else in the car and as she was walking away she began to make a statement but then stopped. At this time, I could observe her demeanor to be shaky and nervous and her lip was trembling. She asked if I believed her in a shaky voice and when I said no she just walked away. A member of the Fire Department was nearby and I asked if Crockett was the one he talked to and he stated no, that it was a girl in a tank top that was driving. The driver of the other vehicle involved also advised that he does not believe Crockett was driving and that is when Crockett walked back over to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I pulled Crockett to the side and asked her where she was sitting at in the vehicle. She did not answer, and instead said that she already gave me her license and registration and wanted to know what I needed from her. I again asked where she was sitting in the vehicle and she said, &amp;ldquo;where do you expect me to be sitting&amp;rdquo;. She then tried to walk away and began asking if she was under arrest several times before I stopped her and explained the situation to her. I then asked her again, where was she sitting at in the vehicle. She then said, &amp;ldquo;In the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat&amp;rdquo; as she turned her head to look away from me and at the Toyota. I then told her that a witness stated she was not driving and when I asked her two more times who was driving she said, &amp;ldquo;I just told you&amp;rdquo; and was referring to herself. I explained to her that giving a false statement to a police officer is a criminal offense and she then turned away and stated she needs to call her lawyer. I could observe as I was talking to her that her lip was quivering, she was avoiding looking directly at me, her speech was somewhat shaky, and her breathing was quick and shallow. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point, I discovered that the driver of the at fault vehicle was not on scene, and had actually left the scene prior to my arrival. Lampert also advised that Crockett was not the driver and that she pulled up after the accident in the Acura. I walked to the Acura and could see that Crockett was in the driver seat with her daughter Cook in the passenger seat. I advised her that I now knew she was not involved in the accident at all and that there was a young girl in a tank top who had left the scene and that she was now giving a false statement to a police officer. I gave her ample opportunity before and after explaining the situation to her to tell me the truth and to tell me who was driving. I could see that she was constantly looking around and appeared extremely nervous. I told her that she had already told me that she was driving to which she was now stating that she never did say that she was driving. I asked her if she knew who was driving and she stated no. I then asked her if her car was stolen and she said she never said that. I continued to talk to her and at one point she stated that her lawyer advised her to not answer any questions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I spoke to Crockett at length for several more minutes before a young girl wearing a tank top arrived back on scene and immediately went to the Toyota and began to retrieve belongings out of it. My partner on scene, TFC Romeo, spoke to her, identified her as Monica Camille Crockett-Johnson, and observed her to be very upset. Johnson admitted to driving the vehicle and leaving the scene and also made statements that her mother Crockett was lying for her so she would not get in trouble. Johnson was later appropriately charged for leaving the scene of an accident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I completed an application for charges on Crockett and was issued a Summons on 07/29 for Crockett. On 07/30 at approximately 1636 hours, Crockett was served with the Criminal summons and a signed copy has been attached to this report. All accident information can be found under the ACRS report with the same case number.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Wicomico County &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;TFC Todd 6929 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;</NarrativeText>
