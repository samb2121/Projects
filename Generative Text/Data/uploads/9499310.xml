         <NarrativeText>&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This case is related to 22-MSP-041533*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This incident was audibly and visibly recorded on my Axon Body Worn Camera.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Physical Evidence:&lt;br /&gt; - Eleven (11) miscellaneous photographs pertaining to this case&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Narrative:&lt;br /&gt; On October 2, 2023, at approximately 1105 hours, the complainant, Brian Paul Davis (White/Male, DOB: 06/06/1984) responded to the Prince Frederick Barrack in reference to his ex-wife, Rachael Renee Croce/Davis (White/Female, DOB: 01/20/1985), stalking him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I made contact with Brian in the lobby of the barrack as he was visibly angry and frustrated. Brian stated at approximately 1045 hours, he responded to the Calvert County Circuit Court building, located at 175 Main Street, Prince Frederick, Maryland, to retrieve three subpoenas for Calvert County Deputies in reference to an unrelated hearing against Rachael. Brian stated when he left the Circuit Court building, he immediately saw Rachael sitting in her vehicle in a parking spot staring at them. Brian stated he took pictures of Rachael in her vehicle, and as he passed in front of her vehicle, she did not say anything to him or his daughter and did not make eye contact. Brian stated he then immediately responded to the barrack to report the stalking. Brian was able to provide several photographs with timestamps showing Rachael sitting in her blue Hyundai SUV, bearing Maryland registration 9AT3483, parked in front of the Calvert County Circuit Courthouse. A METERS/NCIC check of that registration confirms the vehicle is registered to Rachael. It appears, by looking at the photographs, that Rachael is the only person in the vehicle. According to the pictures, Rachael is seated in the driver&amp;#39;s seat and was positively identified by Brian.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At approximately 1114 hours, as I was speaking with Brian, his phone began to ring and as it was ringing, he showed me his phone with a caller ID that showed &amp;quot;Rachael #8&amp;quot;. Brian stated that was one of many phone numbers Rachael calls him on because he has blocked so many other phone numbers. The caller, allegedly Rachael, did not leave a voicemail. I attempted to call the phone number back (240-317-7976) utilizing the &amp;quot;10-21 Police Phone&amp;quot; application. It rang several times and then went to voicemail. There were no identifying characteristics on the voicemail readback that had ties to Rachael. I asked Brian if Rachael had any reason, especially related to the children, to call him today, and he stated no. When Brian had to respond back outside to his vehicle to retrieve this case number, he advised Rachael was gone.&amp;nbsp;I asked Brian if Rachael would have any way of knowing he was at the courthouse or whether he spoke with her today. Brian advised he saw Rachael this morning when she dropped off his older daughter at the bus stop, however they did not communicate. Brian stated he did not tell Rachael about his plans to go to Circuit Court, and he doesn&amp;#39;t know how she knew he was there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After leaving the barrack, at approximately 1430 hours, Brian sent me a screenshot of a message he sent to Rachael that stated, &amp;quot;DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME IN ANY WAY. If it pertains to the girls, I may respond. I&amp;#39;m respectfully asking you for the very last time.&amp;quot; After that text was sent, Rachael responded back with emojis that most commonly mean, &amp;quot;Rock on&amp;quot; [see attached screenshot for reference] on October 3, 2023 at 1932 hours. Brian stated Rachael has been warned before not to communicate with him at a court hearing by Judge Rappaport in 2021, however it was said verbally and he does not have any paperwork documenting that warning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On Sunday, October 8, 2023, at approximately 1626 hours, Brian made contact with me via email and stated Rachael was again harassing him and showed up to the same location he was washing his vehicle at. Brian advised he was washing his vehicle at the self-service car wash, Double Bubble Auto Wash, located at 165 Central Square Drive, Prince Frederick, MD 20678. Brian sent pictures as evidence of this interaction which showed Brian&amp;#39;s truck clearly being washed, as soap suds are all over it and it is parked in a wash bay and then the other pictures show Rachael sitting in her&amp;nbsp;blue Hyundai SUV, bearing Maryland registration 9AT3483, while he was washing his vehicle. The pictures would reflect Rachael had no intention of washing her vehicle as she was not pulled up to a wash bay and was parked in a manner that would allow her to watch Brian. Brian stated it feels like everyday she is stalking him and showing up at places he is and he doesn&amp;#39;t know how. Brian believes Rachael has some sort of tracking device on his phone. I have advised Brian to check his vehicle for GPS trackers as Rachael continues to show up places he is at routinely without any permission from Brian.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Brian advised me Rachael has been stalking him for several years. He stated Rachael struggles with mental illness and is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and other things. Brian advised he believes Rachael is in one of her manic states, and when she is, the stalking and harassing becomes worse. Brian stated when Rachael stalks him, she repeatedly shows up places he is to try and upset their youngest daughter, who is three years old. Brian stated when his three-year-old daughter sees Rachael, she becomes upset and wants to be with her which then causes commotion. Brian advised he is at his whits end and that the courts won&amp;#39;t grant a Protective Order because Rachael has not made any threats that have made him feel like he&amp;#39;s in danger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I request this case remain open pending the completion of an Application for Charges formally charging Rachael with:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;*1_0191* Harass, a Course of Conduct&lt;br /&gt; *1_5309* Telephone Misuse: Single Call&lt;br /&gt; *1_1712* Electronic Communication Harass&lt;br /&gt; *1_5406* Harass Follow With Intent To&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:107%"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All events occurred in Calvert County, Maryland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</NarrativeText>
